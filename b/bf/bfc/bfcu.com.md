# Bethpage Federal Credit Union - About Us -> Privacy

  | 

  
Bethpage Federal Credit Union is committed to providing you with extraordinary service, anytime, anywhere. An important part of that commitment is the protection of your personal information. Whether you open your account at a Bethpage branch location or through the Internet, we understand that you may be concerned about the privacy of information you provide to us, or that is generated as a result of your visit to our website. Be assured that we are committed to your financial well being and protecting the privacy and security of your confidential information. To address these issues, Bethpage has instituted the following privacy policy.

  
Personal Information includes all of the personal information you provide us both electronically and in hard copy. Information is collected when you bank on or off-line, use our online bill paying services, apply for products and services, send us e-mail or use various calculators, planners or questionnaires on our web site. This information may include: your name; address; social security number; assets and income; products you are interested in or use; your transactions with us, such as your account balance and loan payment history; information received from consumer reporting agencies, such as your creditworthiness and credit history; your e-mail address, Internet Service Provider, the web browser you use, and the content of any sent or received cookie.

  
Bethpage will use the information obtained about you to properly identify you, to maintain accurate account balance information, to help us provide you with efficient service and the products and services you request. This information also assists us in designing and improving our products and services to address your specific needs.  
We may disclose some information about you to companies that administer the products and services we provide, or to offer you a broader array of products and services. Companies that perform business operations for us, such as check printing, are only provided with the information necessary for them to perform the specific function. Bethpage is extremely selective in choosing and contracting with these second parties and requires them to adhere to appropriate privacy and security standards.  
We also may release information about you when legally required to do so (i.e., in response to a subpoena or court order) or to prevent fraud.

  
We do not disclose any nonpublic information about our members or former members to anyone except as permitted by law. We do not sell any customer information to anyone. In those situations where we are permitted to disclose information, we may disclose all the information we collect, as described above. For example, we may disclose nonpublic personal information about you to third parties to assist us in servicing your loan or account with us, to government entities and to third parties in response to subpoenas, and to consumer reporting agencies. We may also disclose information we collect, as described above, to nonaffiliated third parties that perform account administration services or functions on our behalf, marketing services on our behalf, to other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements, and for other reasons allowed by law. We may also disclose certain nonpublic personal information we collect to our affiliates, such as Bethpage Financial Services, for the purpose of providing you with information about additional products and services that may benefit you.  
Security of Your Personal Information:   
Bethpage continually updates and improves the physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards required to comply with all applicable legal standards to protect the security of your personal information.  
All employees are required to agree in writing to protect the confidentiality of customer data and to use it only for credit union purposes. We restrict access to your personal and account information to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you.  
The Internet is a public network. Therefore, it is important to learn how you can safeguard your banking information, credit card numbers, social security number and other personal data, and to learn about and take advantage of security features. Some examples of security features are: 

  
Encryption is the process of scrambling private information to prevent unauthorized access. To show that your transmission is encrypted, some browsers display a small icon on your screen that looks like a "lock" or a "key" whenever you conduct secure transactions online. Avoid sending sensitive information, such as account numbers, through unsecured e-mail.   
Passwords, access codes or personal identification numbers (PINs) should be used when accessing an account online. Your password should be unique to you and you should change it regularly. Do not use birth dates or other numbers or words that may be easy for others to guess. NEVER GIVE YOUR PASSWORD (s), ACCESS CODES (s) OR PIN (s) TO ANYONE.   
General security over your personal computer such as virus protection and physical access controls should be used and updated regularly. Contact your hardware and software suppliers or Internet service provider to ensure you have the latest in security updates.

  
The Internet offers the potential for safe, convenient new ways to shop for financial services and conduct banking business, any day, any time. As an added convenience to our members, the Bethpage website may offer online links to merchants, retail stores, travel agents and other non-financial sites. Please remember that an outside website may not be secure and the company’s products and services may not be insured by the NCUA. We cannot guarantee your privacy or the products and services in these cases. As in everyday business, before you order a product or service online, make sure you are comfortable with the reputation of the company making the offer. Only then should you release any personal information. 

  
Bethpage recognizes its responsibility to protect children’s privacy and safety online. The Bethpage web site is not directed to children and does not collect or retain individually identifiable information about children under the age of 13.

  
Bethpage has procedures in place to insure that your personal information is accurately recorded and maintained and that any inaccurate or incomplete information is corrected in a timely manner.  
If you have any reason to believe that your personal information is incorrect, you may contact us by mail at P.O. Box 127 Bethpage, NY 11714; by phone at 1-800-628-7070; or by e-mail (if you visit our web site, [www.bfcu.com](http://www.bfcu.com/)). Be sure to include your name, telephone number and your account numbers. 

  
We understand the importance of your privacy and recognize that you may prefer that we not disclose nonpublic personal information about you. If you prefer that Bethpage or its affiliate, BFCU Financial Services, Inc., not share certain nonpublic personal information about you with nonaffiliated third parties, you may restrict information sharing (other than those disclosures permitted by law). Such an election means you "opt out" of information sharing.  
Your election to opt out will apply to all products and services you obtain with Bethpage and its affiliates for personal, family or household purposes. If you have a joint account with one or more other individuals, an opt out sent by any one individual on the joint account will cause that account to be identified as an opt out account.   
With that in mind we are providing you with a number of ways to opt out of these disclosures. If you wish to opt out of these disclosures, you may contact us either in person at one of our branches, by writing to us at P.O. Box 127 Bethpage, NY 11714, by phone at 1-800-628-7070 or by e-mail (if you visit our web site, [www.bfcu.com](http://www.bfcu.com/)). Be sure to include your name, telephone number and your account numbers. This opt out request will apply to all of your accounts, both joint and individual, and will remain in effect until it is revoked by you, in writing. Your opt out direction will be honored even if your member relationship with the credit union ends.

  
You may print a copy of this Privacy Policy notice from our website for your records or you can receive a printed copy by calling us at 1-800-628-7070 or writing to P.O. Box 127, Bethpage, NY 11714. You may also retain a copy of this notice by saving from our website to a file on your personal computer. In order to save and view this notice, you will need software that will allow you to copy it into a format that you can keep. To print this Privacy Policy notice you will need a printer and to save it you will need a storage device such as a disk drive or tape drive. It is your responsibility to maintain the necessary hardware and software that will enable you to print or save this notice for your records.

Only deposit accounts offered through Bethpage Federal Credit Union are eligible for NCUA insurance coverage. Non-deposit investment and insurance products, such as mutual funds, stocks, annuities and life insurance policies that may be sold through this web site or at a Bethpage branch location, are not NCUA-insured, are not guaranteed by the credit union, and may lose value.
