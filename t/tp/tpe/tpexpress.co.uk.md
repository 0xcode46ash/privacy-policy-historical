---  
  
First/Keolis TransPennine Limited ("First TransPennine Express") is committed to preserving the privacy of all visitors to http://www.tpexpress.co.uk and to protecting any personal information that you may provide to us. In particular, we believe it is important for you to know how we treat information about you that we may receive from this website ("Site") and how we carry out data processing practices through the use of the Internet and any other electronic communications networks. Please read the following privacy policy to understand how we use and protect the information that you provide to us or how we may use and protect it in the future.

In general, you can visit this Site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our web server collects the IP address. In addition, there are parts of this Site where personal information may need to be collected from you for a specific purpose, such as to provide you with certain information you request, or where requested to register you to, for example, our Journey Check Alerts Service, or to enable you to use our online ticket purchasing service. This is done through the use of online forms and every time you email us or provide us with your details in other ways (i.e. over the telephone, by fax, by mail etc.).
