**Children's Privacy**

This statement discloses the privacy practices for portions of About.com directed at children under 13. About.com will NOT:

•  | collect online contact information from a user under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent, which includes an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and participation in the activity. When we do not obtain prior verifiable parental consent, online contact information will be used only to directly respond to the child's request and will not be used to contact the child for other purposes.   
---|---  
•  | collect personally identifiable offline contact information from users under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.   
•  | distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information collected from a child under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.   
•  | give the ability to children to send e-mail, create personal web pages, participate in forums or kids chat rooms without prior verifiable parental consent.   
•  | entice a child under 13 by the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity, to divulge more information than is needed to participate in such activity.   
  
We will also place prominent notice wherever personally identifiable information is collected requesting the child to ask a parent for permission to proceed.

The following are details of the information we collect and how we use it:

•  | About, Inc. collects data so that we may display personalized content to our visitors. Additionally, usage information may be analyzed so that we can judge our system's performance or execute your customized features. Your computer reaches us via a particular IP, (InternetProtocol), address. This can tell us things like what part of the world your computer is connecting from. Or what service provider you are using. Your browser offers so-called "cookies" which -- if you or your child allow their use -- store small amounts of data on your computer about your child's visit to any of our sites. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features your child likes best. And when your child re-visits our GuideSites, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your child's preferences. However, cookies tell us nothing about your child personally unless you or your child specifically give us additional information. Demographic information may be used to customize the display of our GuideSitesTM to your child by showing content that we think might be of interest or related to the child's past visits.   
---|---  
•  | Some of the banner ads displayed in our GuideSitesTM are provided by outside companies. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our advertisers and we do not have access to this information. Cookies in and of themselves do not contain any personally identifiable information about your child.   
•  | The About.com Web site includes many topical areas that all users may access. By giving your verifiable consent to allow your child to use chat, forums, newsletters, and/or any other functionality of the About.com Web site in which your child may provide personally identifiable information, your child will also have access to those relevant functionalities throughout the About.com Web site, including those areas which are not directed toward children. Please monitor your child's use of other areas of the Web site which are not directed toward children.   
•  | We produce aggregate reports for advertisers. For example, we tell advertisers how many people saw or clicked on an ad and additionally, how many people saw or clicked on ads in different portions of our service. Where available, we may offer additional information about viewer characteristics. However this does not include personally identifiable information or online usage patterns. Our advertisers allow us to provide our service to our users and our members. In return, they need to know how to effectively place their ads to potential customers.   
•  | We'll use email contact information to provide members with newsletters to which the member subscribed, or for similar information we think the member may find of interest. However, you can choose to discontinue your child's receipt of these mailings.   
  
**COPPA**

Because we care about the safety and privacy of children online, we comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA and its accompanying FTC regulation establish United States federal law that protects the privacy of children using the Internet. We offer the following for the protection of children under 13:

•  | Many About.com activities may collect information about children under 13, including e-mail, personal web pages, forum participation, and kids chat rooms. Use of such activities requires initial registration by the participant. Children under 13 who wish to register are asked to have a parent or legal guardian do so for them. The parent must provide a credit card number for verification that he/she is an adult. Upon verification, the parent can choose which activities he or she would like the child to participate in. The parent can change the selected activities at any time.   
---|---  
•  | After obtaining parental consent, we collect and maintain the name, date of birth, and email address of children who register. We use this information to contact children for subscription to newsletters and notification of contests. Parents can review their child's personal information, ask to have it deleted and refuse to allow any further collection or use of their child's information. To do so, log on as a member and clicking on the Parental Controls link in their membership profile.   
•  | We do not distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information collected from children under 13 or from sites that are specifically directed to children under 13.   
•  | We use a technology called "cookies" to track what pages users visit on our service, as described in the previous section of this document. We also use cookies to check the age of registered users who enter chat rooms in sites located outside of the Kids channel. Users under 13 are not permitted in chat rooms unless their parents have consented to their participation, as above.   
  
This site is operated by About.com. We are the only operator that collects or maintains children's personal information through this site. If you have any questions regarding this policy or the safety of kids at About.com, please contact us at: About, Inc., 1440 Broadyway, New York, NY, 10018, call us at (212) 204-4000, or email us at [kidsprivacy@about.com.](mailto:kidsprivacy@about.com)
