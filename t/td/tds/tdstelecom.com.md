# TDS Telecom - Privacy Policy Statement

| 

TDS Telecom understands our customer's concerns about how the information we gather is used and shared. It is our intention to only use this information sensibly, safely, and with our customer's best interest in mind. Recently, many Internet service providers were asked by law enforcement agencies to disclose information such as customer lists and databases in the interest of protecting national security. To date, TDS Telecom has not been asked to disclose such information. However, we will do so if requested. We would like to reassure you that we will do whatever we can to protect your privacy while supporting our government in times of crisis. 

The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at the TDS Telecom Web site.

By visiting the TDS Telecom Web site, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice. 

What personal information does TDS Telecom gather? 

  * **Information You Give Us**  
We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. We use the information that you provide for purposes such as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our site, and communicating with you, electronically, through the mail, and occasionally by phone. 
  * **Automatically Gathered Information**  
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, our server collects domain names, e-mail addresses (where possible), and information on what pages our guests access or visit at our site. 
  * **Information from Other Sources**  
We occasionally receive updated delivery and address information from our shippers or other sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily. 
  * **Information Gathered by Ad Servers**  
TDS Telecom has relationships with companies that we allow to place advertising on our Web pages. As a result of your visit to our site, ad server companies may collect information such as your domain type, your IP address, and clickstream information. 

What About Cookies? 
  * Cookies are identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive, through your Web browser, so that our systems can recognize your browser and provide personalized features. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. 

**However** , we recommend that you allow your browser to accept cookies since it is through these identifiers that we're able to provide you with a superior experience on our site. 


Does TDS Telecom Share the Information It Receives? 
  * **Protection of Our Customers**  
TDS Telecom does not sell or give your information to other companies. We may, on occasion, share customer information with subsidiaries of TDS Telecom. 
  * **Protection of TDS Telecom and Others**  
TDS Telecom would only release personal information if we believe it is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of TDS Telecom, our users, or others. This includes sharing information within the TDS family of companies for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 
  * **With Your Consent**  
You may request, in writing, that we do not share your information with our subsidiaries. Please send your request to [webcontact@tdstelecom.com](mailto:webcontact@tdstelecom.com) or to the postal address at the end of this document. 

How Secure Is Information About Me? 
  * **What we do**  
We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information you input.

You may choose at any time to not provide us information. You can disable cookies on your computer or you can visit our site (as well as others) anonymously through the use of available software.
