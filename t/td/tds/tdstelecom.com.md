# TDS Telecom - Privacy Policy Statement

| 

TDS Telecom understands our customer's concerns about how the information we gather is used and shared. It is our intention to only use this information sensibly, safely, and with our customer's best interest in mind. Recently, many Internet service providers were asked by law enforcement agencies to disclose information such as customer lists and databases in the interest of protecting national security. To date, TDS Telecom has not been asked to disclose such information. However, we will do so if requested. We would like to reassure you that we will do whatever we can to protect your privacy while supporting our government in times of crisis. 

The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at the TDS Telecom Web site.
