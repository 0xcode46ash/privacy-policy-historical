# Privacy Policy - Themes Harbor

Your privacy is important to us at Themes Harbor. The primary principle which guides us is that we will only ask for your information if we need it. We will never share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, protect our rights, or develop our products. Put simply, we deeply value your privacy. Below you will find the privacy policy for all of Themes Harbor’s websites.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Themes Harbor collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Themes Harbor’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Themes Harbor’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Themes Harbor may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Themes Harbor also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Themes Harbor does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Themes Harbor’s websites choose to interact with Themes Harbor in ways that require Themes Harbor to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Themes Harbor gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, Themes Harbor collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Themes Harbor. Themes Harbor does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

Themes Harbor may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For example, Themes Harbor may reveal how many downloads a particular product version got, or say which products are most popular based on checks from ratings, sales figures, or visits. However, Themes Harbor does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Themes Harbor discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Themes Harbor’s behalf or to provide services available at Themes Harbor’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Themes Harbor’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Themes Harbor will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Themes Harbor discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Themes Harbor believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Themes Harbor, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Themes Harbor website and have supplied your email address, Themes Harbor may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Themes Harbor and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Themes Harbor takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Themes Harbor uses cookies to help Themes Harbor identify and track visitors, their usage of Themes Harbor website, and their website access preferences. Themes Harbor visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Themes Harbor’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Themes Harbor’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Business Transfers

If Themes Harbor, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Themes Harbor goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Themes Harbor may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

### Ads

Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Themes Harbor and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Themes Harbor may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Themes Harbor’s sole discretion. Themes Harbor encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
