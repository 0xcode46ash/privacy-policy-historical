# TDA - TDA privacy statement

The TDA considers protection of your privacy to be of utmost importance and we are committed to providing you with a personalised service that meets your requirements in a way that safeguards your privacy. 

This policy explains how we may collect information about you and then use it in order to satisfy your particular requirements. It also outlines some of the security measures that we take in order to protect your privacy and gives certain assurances on things that we will not do.

When we first obtain personal information from you we will give you the opportunity to indicate if you do or do not (as applicable) wish to receive information from us about other services. This may be done by:

  * a tick box on an on-line or paper registration or application; 
  * verbal confirmation by a telephone adviser. 



You may revise the choice that you have made at any time by writing to us informing us of the change.

Some of the personal information we hold about you may be sensitive personal data within the meaning of the Data Protection Act 1998 - for example, information about your health or ethnic origin. We will not use sensitive personal data about you other than for the specific purpose for which you provide it.

  1. ### Collection of information

We may collect personal information about you from a number of sources, including: 

    * from you when you agree to take a service from us in which case this may include your contact details, date of birth, details of your qualifications; 
    * from you when you contact us with an enquiry or in response to a communication from us, in which case this may tell us something about your preferences; 

from publicly available sources. 

  2. ### Use of information

2.1 
    Information you provide or we hold about you (whether or not under our contract(s) with you) may be used by us and/or our agents to: 
    * identify you when you make enquiries; 
    * help administer, and contact you about improved administration of, any services provided by us previously, now or in the future; 
    * carry out marketing analysis and applicant profiling (including with transactional information) and create statistical and testing information; 
    * help us to prevent and detect fraud or loss; and 
    * contact you by various means (including mail, e-mail, telephone, text or multimedia messages) about other services offered by us, and our contracted partners. We will only contact you in this way if you have previously indicated your consent. In addition, we will only contact you by e-mail, text or multimedia message about other people's services, or services which are not similar to those you have sought from us, if you have explicitly opted in to receiving such material. 
  3. ### Disclosure and transfer of information

3.1 
    We may disclose your information to other related education sector bodies such as the Department for Children, Schools and Families, for them to carry out any of these purposes as set out in clause 2.1 above. 
3.2 
    Under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 we may be required to release information held by the TDA to any requesting body. This may include collated statistics from information you have provided us with, but it will in no way affect your right to privacy under data protection. 
3.3 
    We may disclose information we hold about you to third parties where legitimately requested for legal or regulatory purposes, or as part of legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings. 
3.4 
    We may also find it necessary to transfer your personal information to third parties located outside the European Economic Area (EEA). This may happen where companies who process data on behalf of TDA are based outside of the EEA. The data protection and other laws of these countries may not be as comprehensive as those in the UK or the EU - in these instances we take rigorous steps to ensure an adequate level of protection is given to your information. 
  4. ### Monitoring

You should also note that communications with you (including phone conversations and e-mails) may be monitored and recorded by us for quality assurance, legal, regulatory and training purposes. 

  5. ### Protection of information

We maintain strict security measures in order to protect personal information. This includes following certain procedures, for example to check your identity when you telephone us, encrypting data on our websites and in order to ensure compliance with all applicable legal requirements. 

  6. ### The internet

6.2
