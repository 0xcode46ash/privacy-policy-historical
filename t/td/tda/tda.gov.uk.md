# TDA - TDA privacy statement

The TDA considers protection of your privacy to be of utmost importance and is committed to providing you with a personalised service that meets your requirements in a way that safeguards your privacy.

This policy explains how the TDA may collect information about you and then use it in order to satisfy your particular requirements. It also outlines some of the security measures that the Agency takes in order to protect your privacy and gives certain assurances on things that the Agency will not do.

When the Agency first obtains personal information from you, you are given the opportunity to indicate if you do or do not (as applicable) wish to receive information from the Agency about other services. Normally this will be done by way of a tick box on an application form or contract. You may revise the choice that you have made at any time by writing to inform the TDA of the change.

Some of the personal information the Agency holds about you may be sensitive personal data within the meaning of the Data Protection Act 1998 - for example, information about your health or ethnic origin. The Agency will not use sensitive personal data about you other than for the specific purpose for which you provide it.

### Collection of information

The Agency may collect personal information about you from a number of sources, including:

  * from you when you agree to take a service from the Agency in which case this may include your contact details, date of birth, details of your qualifications
  * from you when you contact the Agency with an enquiry or in response to a TDA communication from the Agency, in which case this may tell us something about your preferences, and
  * from publicly available sources, such as the electoral register.



### Use of information

Information you provide or the Agency holds about you (whether or not under the TDA’s contract(s) with you) may be used by the Agency and/or our agents to:

  * identify you when you make enquiries
  * help administer, and contact you about improved administration of, any services provided by the Agency previously, now or in the future
  * carry out marketing analysis and applicant profiling (including with transactional information) and create statistical and testing information
  * help the Agency to prevent and detect fraud or loss, and
  * contact you by various means (including mail, e-mail, telephone or text or multimedia messages) about other services offered by the Agency, and selected partners. 
  * 


The TDA will only contact you in this way if you have previously indicated your consent.  In addition, the TDA will only contact you by e-mail, text or multimedia message about other people’s services, or services which are not similar to those you have sought from the Agency, if you have explicitly opted in to receiving such material.

### Disclosure and transfer of information

The TDA may disclose your information to other related education sector bodies such as DfES, for them to carry out any of these purposes as set out in clause 2.1 above.

Under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 the Agency may be required to release information held by the TDA to any requesting body. This may include collated statistics from information you have provided the Agency with, but it will in no way affect you right to privacy under Data Protection.

The Agency may disclose information held about you to third parties where legitimately requested for legal or regulatory purposes, or as part of legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings.

The Agency may also find it necessary to transfer your personal information to third parties located outside the European Economic Area (EEA). This may happen where companies who process data on behalf of TDA are based outside of the EEA. The data protection and other laws of these countries may not be as comprehensive as those in the UK or the EU - in these instances steps will be taken to ensure an adequate level of protection is given to your information.

### Monitoring

You should also note that communications with you (including phone conversations and e-mails) may be monitored and recorded by us for quality assurance, legal, regulatory and training purposes.

### Protection of information

The Agency maintains strict security measures in order to protect personal information. This includes following certain procedures, for example to check your identity when you telephone the TDA, encrypting data on our websites and in order to ensure compliance with all applicable legal requirements.

### The internet

If you communicate with the Agency via the internet then the TDA may occasionally use e-mail to contact you about our services. When you first provide personal information to our website the Agency will normally give you the opportunity to indicate whether you would prefer us not to contact you in this way. However, you can contact us at any time to change your preferences.

Please be aware that communications over the internet, such as e-mails/webmails, are not secure unless they have been encrypted. Your communications may route through a number of countries before being delivered - this is the nature of the world wide web/internet. The TDA cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.

The Agency may use 'cookies' to monitor website user traffic patterns and site usage. This helps the Agency to understand how our applicants and potential applicants use the TDA’s websites so that it can develop and improve the design, layout and functionality of the sites. A cookie is a piece of information that is stored on your computer's hard drive and which records your navigation of a website so that, when you revisit that website, it can present tailored options to you based upon the stored information about your last visit.
