You are able to browse our site and place an order without registering, but you will need to do so in order to take advantage of special TLA features. We may also ask you for personal information when you contact our customer service department. This is necessary so we can protect against fraud and to process your request more efficiently.

We never sell or rent your billing or credit card information to any third parties under any circumstance.

In these cases, sharing your email address will not be required and the promotion will include specific information about how your email address will be shared.

On occasion, we partner with other major companies whose products or services we feel offer the same high quality and standards as our own. In these instances our postal mailing lists are made available to them. While we carefully pick and choose whom we partner with, we understand perfectly if you prefer to hear from no one but us. To remain exclusively with us and not receive information about any other companies or their services, please call us at 1-800-333-8521, ext. 1 or e-mail [helpdesk@tlavideo.com](mailto:helpdesk@tlavideo.com).

You will be notified via prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

We may share aggregated demographic and statistical information with our partners. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

4\. How you can decide what marketing communication your receive from us

You can choose to stop receiving these emails at any time.

If you would prefer to receive no email from TLA ever, simply go to [My User Account](https://www.tlasecure.com/customer/userlogin.cfm?v=1&sn=1&g=0&go=%2Fcustomer%2Faccount%5Fmain%2Ecfm%3Fv%3D1%26g%3D0%26sn%3D1&domain=tlavideo.com&fsc=\(*CFID*!1.1233693E8,*sn*!1,*CFTOKEN*!7.4159406E7,*ic*!false\)), log in, click "Mailing List Preferences" and click the box requesting to be removed from all mailing lists.

5\. Accessing your personal information

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct or update it by making the change on our member information page or by emailing our Customer Support at helpdesk@tlavideo.com. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at helpdesk@tlavideo.com. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

6\. How we protect the security of your personal information

The security of your personal information is as important to TLA as it is to you. TLA uses a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). TLA has obtained a digital certificate from [GeoTrust, Inc.](https://www.geotrust.com/) When you enter a secure section of the TLA site, an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in the bottom bar of your browser. If you click on this image, a small pop-up window displaying site-security information will appear. The digital certificate guarantees that your personal information and/or sensitive information (such as a credit card number) is being transmitted to the secure and encrypted TLA Web server. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at [helpdesk@tlavideo.com.](mailto:helpdesk@tlavideo.com)

Your personal information is protected by the password you created when you registered an account at TLA. It is your responsibility to keep this password confidential. You may change this password at anytime by going to [My User Account](https://www.tlasecure.com/customer/userlogin.cfm?v=1&sn=1&g=0&go=%2Fcustomer%2Faccount%5Fmain%2Ecfm%3Fv%3D1%26g%3D0%26sn%3D1&domain=tlavideo.com&fsc=\(*CFID*!1.1233693E8,*sn*!1,*CFTOKEN*!7.4159406E7,*ic*!false\)). Log in with your email address and password and then click "Account Information" and enter a new password.

7\. Links to other sites

Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of TLA. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any Web site you visit.
