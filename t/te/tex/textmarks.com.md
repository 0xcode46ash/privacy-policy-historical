## TextMarks Privacy Policy  
(Last Updated September 19, 2012)  


* * *

This Privacy Policy governs TextMarks's collection, use, and disclosure of the information that we collect and receive from users of our Services. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service. This Privacy Policy applies to information that you provide to us through your use of the Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any products or services provided by third parties, even if those third parties are partners of TextMarks.

### Information Collection and Use  


In the course of using our Services, you may provide us with personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you, information on your use of our Services that may be connected with you. When you register for the Services, and at certain times during your use of the Services, TextMarks will ask you for certain personal information, including but not limited to, your phone number(s), email address, credit card or other billing information and home and business postal addresses.

TextMarks also receives and collects your mobile phone number when you send a text message to us. To create a textmark using our Services, you must associate your mobile phone number with your TextMarks account. Simply receiving textmarks on your mobile phone does not require you to register for an account with us, although creating textmarks through our Services or using other advanced features on the Services, will require you to register.

If you request a textmark from your mobile phone or subscribe to a textmark through our Services, the manager of that textmark will be able to see your mobile phone number - just like any individual to whom you send a text message directly would.

Our use of the information we collect through our Services is limited to providing the Services as described in this Privacy Policy. This information may be used

  1. to provide you with products and services you request;
  2. to anticipate and resolve problems with our Services;
  3. to improve and update our Services;
  4. to process and respond to inquiries;
  5. for other purposes communicated to you at the time you provide or authorize the use of the information.
