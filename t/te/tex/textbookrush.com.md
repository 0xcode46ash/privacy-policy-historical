###  Information Collection and Use

TextbookRush is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to any outside parties, except as outlined in this policy. TextbookRush collects information from users at several different places on our website in order to process orders and better serve you with pertinent information. Information collected includes name, shipping address, billing address, telephone numbers, e-mail address, and payment information such as credit card. TextbookRush also requires you to submit a user name and password of your choice for future access to your information. Your user name and password is to remain confidential and you should not share this information with anyone.

###  Registration

In order to process your orders using this website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information, which includes name, e-mail, telephone number and physical address. This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site, such as sending automated order status updates. **This information is NOT shared.**

###  Orders

Most of the information collected in the registration process will be used to process orders. In the order process, a user must provide additional financial information such as credit card number and expiration date. This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill customer’s orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. We do not share your personal and financial information with any third parties. The only exception is when processing your credit card information with the merchant bank for authorization and approval. This process is protected by an enhanced security system. **Note: For enhanced security and privacy, TextbookRush does NOT save your credit/debit card information.** See Security section for more details on security measures and procedures.

###  Cookies

These companies do not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. We also use third party service providers for the shopping cart (Google Checkout & PayPal) and they do not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
