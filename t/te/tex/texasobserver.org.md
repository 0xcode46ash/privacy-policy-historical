# TexasObserver.org Privacy Policy

TexasObserver.org respects your right to the privacy of the personal information you provide us on our Web site. To that end, unless you designate otherwise or we state otherwise in this policy or at the time information is collected, any personal information you provide to TexasObserver.org will be known only to two parties: you and TexasObserver.org. The following policy is intended to explain how your personal information will be treated as you make use of our site. Personal information includes your name, street and e-mail addresses, billing information, click-through activity and any other personal information you may provide here. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.

**Traffic data**

Each time a visitor comes to TexasObserver.org, our servers -- like most on the Web -- collect some basic technical information, including, for example, the visitor's domain name, referral data and browser and platform type.

We also count, track and aggregate the visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our site (e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the TexasObserver.org sites, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information about visitors and visits into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with our supporters; but we will not disclose your individual identity or personally identifiable data without your permission.

**Use of TexasObserver.org cookies**

A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies in a limited way to identify unique browsers that visit us and to track usage throughout our site.

The information about readership and site usage that we collect through cookies is aggregated into general reports about readership and not tied to individual identities, with one exception. TexasObserver.org saves usage information collected with cookies for Partner subscribers solely for the use of our customer support team to help resolve problems subscribers may have.

**_Observer_ Partners **

In order to subscribe, _Observer_ Partners provide the _Observer_ with personal information including name, address, e-mail address and credit card information. The _Observer_ keeps all such information strictly confidential and does not reuse, resell or redistribute it in any way.

At the time of registering for their subscription, _Observer_ Partners are asked whether they wish to receive e-mail from the _Observer_. The _Observer_ does not reuse or resell the list of users who have "opted in" to such mailings.

**_Observer_ E-mails**

In order to receive _Observer_ E-mails, subscribers provide the _Observer_ with personal information including an e-mail address and zip code. The _Observer_ collects this information so that we can effectively alert readers to regional events.

**Letters to the editor**

The _Observer_ asks senders of letters to the editor to include a phone number so we can make an effort to verify their identity should we need to in connection with publication of a letter. We do not retain this information for any other purpose, nor do we sell, trade or otherwise disclose it to third parties.

**"E-mail to a friend" feature**

TexasObserver.org offers an "e-mail a friend about this story" feature, allowing site visitors to send e-mail to friends to inform them about an article they might be interested in reading. In order for this feature to function, we ask for e-mail addresses for the recipient (so we know who to mail the message to) and from the sender (so we can tell the recipient who sent the e-mail). We do not store or save these addresses and you will not receive e-mail or other communications from The _Observer_ as a result of having used this feature.

"E-mail a friend about this story" is a mail service that individual visitors to TexasObserver.org make use of to send individual e-mails. While this tool cannot be used to send mass "spam" mailings, TexasObserver.org has no control over how our visitors use it, and any e-mail sent through it originates with, and is the responsibility of the sender, not TexasObserver.org.

**I Observe**

TexasObserver.org visitors who register for our I Observe community area provide us with a name, password and a working e-mail address. We use this information to set up your account. We do not sell or redistribute the I _Observer_ membership list and will not send you e-mail at the address you provide, except for infrequent announcements relating to I Observe or as needed to resolve issues that may arise with your I Observe account.

Participants in I Observe are expected to comply with the rules governing the area, but we cannot control third parties' use of information you may choose to provide in such a public forum.

**Promotion**

From time to time, TexasObserver.org may sponsor sweepstakes, contests or other events which require the collection, processing and storage of individual contact and demographic information to be used for the event. The _Observer_ may also co-sponsor these events along with other companies, in which case the user's individual contact and demographic information is likely to be shared with other participating sponsors, who may use this information as they wish. A registrant's personal contact and demographic information will not be released to any third-party organization other than named sponsors without the user's consent, and TexasObserver.org will request that such named sponsors uphold the privacy of the registrants' information by not distributing or sharing such information with any other businesses or organizations.

**Surveys**

TexasObserver.org will from time to time conduct voluntary surveys of visitors to the site to obtain aggregate demographic information about them. Such information may be compiled and shared in the aggregate with advertisers and other third parties, but no personal details will be traceable or associated with specific individuals.

**Our commitment to children's privacy**

Protecting the privacy of the very young is important to us. For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information at our Web sites from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our Web site is structured to attract anyone under 13.

**Other disclosure of personal information**

The _Observer_ will not otherwise use or disclose your personal information (personally identifiable data such as your name, email address, password) without your consent except (i) as described in this privacy policy, or (ii) as required by law to be disclosed. This policy does not protect information you post to any on-line bulletin board, chat room, newsgroup or other public forum within our Web sites.

**Unsubscribe and data removal policies**

If you would like to remove your name and e-mail address from our I Observe registration database, you can send an e-mail requesting removal [Webmaster@TexasObserver.org](mailto:Webmaster@TexasObserver.org) .

**Other sites**

TexasObserver.org contains many links to other sites on the Web. We cannot control and are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other Web sites.

**Who can I ask if I have any additional questions?**

If you have any further questions or concerns about The _Observer_ 's privacy policies and use of personal information, please send them to [editors@texasobserver.org](mailto:editors@texasobserver.org) .
