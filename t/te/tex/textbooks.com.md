We use the Personal Information described above to fulfill your orders for books and related merchandise, provide customer support, and communicate with you. In addition, Textbooks.com may use the information to market its products and services to you. You can opt-out from us using your information for this purpose at any time by logging onto My Account and following the instructions under Preferences and Surveys. 

From time to time we may share Personal Information with our affiliates. These include (a) companies that we own or control, (b) companies that own or control us, or (c) companies that are owned or controlled by the same companies that own or control us. Such information may be used by our affiliates to promote their products and services to you. Where such information sharing occurs, our affiliates will follow the terms contained in this policy. 

Except as described below, Textbooks.com will not disclose your Personal Information to third parties who are not our affiliates without your consent. We do not sell or exchange customer lists or customer information for marketing purposes with non-affiliated third parties, and will not do so without your express permission. We may share anonymous, aggregate information concerning the demographic makeup of our customers to non-affiliated third parties. 

We may share Personal Information we collect for business purposes with companies and individuals who provide servicing, administrative, marketing, and other services for us, or on our behalf. Companies we hire to provide such services are only permitted, by contract, to use your information for the performance of the specific services we have requested of them. 

On occasion, Textbooks.com enters into agreements with non-affiliated third parties under which Textbooks.com provides the third party a commission, or other financial remuneration, based upon the third party's advertising to, or referral of, customers. We may share your Personal Information with such third parties to verify that you have obtained products or services from Textbooks.com, or to verify that Textbooks.com is in compliance with any agreements between Textbooks.com and the third party. 

Textbooks.com may share your Personal Information with others as required, or permitted, by law. This may include sharing your Personal Information with third parties in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process. This may also include sharing your Personal Information with third parties if we believe that doing so is necessary to exercise our legal rights, defend against legal claims, defend against potential legal claims, apply the terms of any of our policies or user agreements, or otherwise protect the rights, property, or safety of Textbooks.com, our users, or others. 

In the event that Textbooks.com, or substantially all of Textbooks.com's assets, are acquired, your Personal Information will be transferred to the acquiring company. In such a situation, you will be provided with notice that a transfer of your Personal Information is imminent, and you will be given an opportunity to opt-out of the transfer of your Personal Information.

  * **Automatically collected information.** Textbooks.com's web servers automatically collect anonymous information about a visitor's IP address, browser type and referrer by reading this information from your browser. This information is collected in a database and is used to help us recognize you each time you return to our site. This information is automatically logged by most websites. 
  * **Information collected using cookies.** Textbooks.com may use various kinds of software devices, such as "cookies" to collect information about Internet use. These small files identify your browser and save information such as passwords so that websites can recognize you. You can set your browser to disable cookies, but some portions of this site (and other sites) may not work properly if you do this. 
  * **Information collected using pixel tags or clear GIFs.** Textbooks.com may use "message format" and "message open" sensing technologies to help us understand the effectiveness of certain of our email marketing efforts. Both technologies require the use of pixel tags or clear GIFs (also called web beacons). The "message format" sensing technology allows us to recognize whether you have enabled your email program to receive HTML emails; if so, this information is then associated with your email address so that subsequent messages can be sent to you in HTML format. The "message open" sensing technology allows us to recognize whether you have opened our email message. We can only detect this if your have enabled your email program to receive HTML emails. 
  * **Collection of Information from Children.** We do not seek information from children. If you are under 18 you should not provide us with any information without the involvement of a parent or guardian.

**How Is Your Personal Information Protected?**

Textbooks.com maintains reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the Personal Information to protect against unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. To further secure your Personal Information: 

  * We have instituted measures to help protect your Personal Information from being intercepted and read as it is transmitted over the Internet. 
  * We cross check an email address with the submitted password to validate access to any Textbooks.com customer account. 
  * We do not allow any email address to access more than one Textbooks.com account. When a new Textbooks.com account is created, we require you to submit an email address that is not associated with an existing Textbooks.com account. 
  * We encourage you to use a password that is not easily determinable (e.g., don't use your name or street name). Keep your password secure; do not share it with anyone. The password is the "key" to your account; anyone who gets this "key" can, along with your email address, gain access to your account. 
    * If you forget your password, go to the My Account log in page and click on the "Forgot your password?" link, and then type in the email address of the account you would like to open. A message will be sent to your email address with instructions on how to access your account and change your password. 
    * If you want to change your password or other account information, simply log onto your account and follow the instructions. 
  * We encourage you to remember to sign out. To further prevent unauthorized access to your account, remember that after you sign in, you should sign out once you have (i) completed your transaction, (ii) completed managing your account, or (iii) decided to step away from your computer. Anyone who accesses your computer after you have signed in but before you have either signed out or your session has timed-out can access your account. 



In the event that your Personal Information is accessed and acquired by an unauthorized individual, we will conduct an investigation to determine if there is a reasonable possibility that your Personal Information has been, or will be, misused. In the event that we determine that misuse is reasonably possible, or that state or federal law requires that we issue a consumer notification, we will notify you of the unauthorized access unless a law enforcement agency believes that such notification may interfere with a criminal investigation. Notification of such an event may be given to you by e-mail, writing, or phone.
