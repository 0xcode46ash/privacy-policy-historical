Telecom Electric Supply maintains high standards for the protection of privacy over the Internet.  The purpose of this statement is to explain the types of information Telecom Electric Supply obtains about vistors to our websites, how the information is obtained, how it is used, and how vistors can restrict its use or disclosure. 

The only information Telecom Electric Supply obtains about individual vistors to our website is information supplied voluntarily by the visitor.  This means that you can visit our websites without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself.  To gauge the effectiveness of our website, we do collect some non-individually identifiable generic information about our visitors.  Our web server automatically recognize a visitor's domain name (such as .com, .edu, etc.), the web page from which a visitor enters our site, which pages a visitor visits on each page.  This information does not reveal a visitor's identity.  We aggregate this information and use it to evaluate and improve our website. 

You can choose to provide individually-identifiable information to Telecom Electric Supply in a number of ways through our website - by ordering a service from us, sending us e-mail, registering to receive news or information about Telecom Electric Supply for a specific purpose. 

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive.  Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information, but they do enable us to provide features such as 1-Click(sm) shopping and to store items in your shopping cart between visits.  Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that.  Even without a cookie, you can still use most of the features in our store, including placing items in your shopping cart and purchasing them. 

We are committed to protecting your privacy.  We use the information we collect on the site to make shopping at Telecom Electric Supply possible and to enhance your overall shopping experience.  We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others.

We do not sell or disclose individually-identifiable information obtained on-line about our visitors, to anyone outside of Telecom Electric Supply unless you specifically authorize it, it is required by law, or disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of customers, employees or property.  If you provide individually-identifiable information to us in the context of an event Telecom Electric Supply sponsors with another company, such as a contest, or if you register on a co-sponsored site or feature, you may also be providing the individually-identifiable information to the co-sponsor.  This will be made clear to you before you submit the information and you can decide whether or not to participate. 

Telecom Electric Supply does not send unsolicited "junk" email (spam).  We may use email to communicate with our customers, to respond to visitors' emails, to confirm orders placed online, and to send information that a visitor has requested.  If you receive an unwanted email from us, you can simply use the reply feature on your browser in order to ask us not to send you future emails.  In the body of your reply, simply ask us to remove you from our list.
