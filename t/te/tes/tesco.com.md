# Tesco.com Privacy policy

Tesco is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our data processing practices and your options regarding the ways in which your personal data is used. If you have any requests concerning your personal information or any queries with regard to our processing please contact us at [online@tesco.co.uk](mailto:online@tesco.co.uk).

## Information collected

Tesco collects the details provided by you on registration together with information we learn about you from your use of our service and your visits to our web site and other sites accessible from them. We also collect information about the transactions you undertake including details of payment cards used.

We may collect additional information in connection with your participation in any promotions or competitions offered by us and information you provide when giving us feedback or completing profile forms. We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site use which enables us to improve the service we provide.

## Access to Clubcard information

We will access the information recorded through the use of your Clubcard to help us improve our service to you and to make our communications more relevant.

For instance, if you use our online grocery service, whenever you buy products at your local Tesco store using your Clubcard, we can automatically add it to your "favourite products" list for the online service.

## Use of your information and your preferences

We will use your information to provide and personalise our service. We will also use your contact details to communicate with you. We may use your information to send you offers and news about Tesco group products and services or those of other carefully selected companies which we think may be of interest to you. We may contact you by post, email, telephone or fax for these purposes.

Once you have registered to use Tesco.com, you will be provided with access to a "Contact Preferences" page that will allow you to tailor our commercial communications to your preferences.

To change your contact preferences simply click "Your Account" in the top frame and click "Your Contact Preferences". If you do not want to receive commercial communications from us, please select your choices by using the boxes available on that page.

We like to hear your views to help us improve our service. From time to time, we may contact you by post, email, telephone or fax to ask your opinions. Again, if you do not want to be contacted for this purpose, please make your choice on the "Contact Preferences" page.

Please note that there may be instances where it may be necessary for us to communicate with you, in any event, for administrative or operational reasons relating to our service.

## Disclosures of your information

Your information may be passed to and used by all Tesco companies. We will never pass your personal data to anyone else, except for any successors in title to our business and suppliers that process data on our behalf both in the UK and abroad. We may also use and disclose information in aggregate (so that no individual customers are identified) for marketing and strategic development purposes.

## Other web sites

Our web site may contain links to other web sites which are outside our control and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. If you access other sites using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect information from you which will be used by them in accordance with their privacy policy, which may differ from ours.

## Cookies

"Cookies" are small pieces of information sent by a web server to a web browser, which enables the server to collect information from the browser. You can find out more about the way cookies work on [http://www.cookiecentral.com](http://www.cookiecentral.com/). Tesco uses cookies for a number of purposes, for instance to enable us to simplify the logging on process for registered users, to help ensure the security and authenticity of registered users, to provide the mechanisms for online shopping and to enable traffic monitoring.

Non-registered visitors of the site are sent anonymous cookies to keep track of their browsing patterns and build up a demographic profile. In addition, any visitor who has clicked on a Tesco.com advertisement on another site that links to Tesco.com will be sent anonymous cookies that will allow us to analyse advertising effectiveness and manage our relationship with affiliate sites.

Whilst you do not need to allow your browser to accept cookies in order to browse much of our web site or to access many of our services, you must have cookies enabled if you wish to shop online at any of our stores or access any areas reserved for registered users.

Most browsers allow you to turn off the cookie function. If you want to know how to do this please look at the help menu on your browser. As described above this will restrict the online Tesco services you can use. 

## Access rights

You have a right to access the personal data that is held about you. To obtain a copy of the personal information Tesco holds about you, please write to us at the following address: Privacy Officer, Corporate Secretariat, Tesco House, Delamare Road, Cheshunt, Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire EN8 9SL enclosing your postal details and a cheque for £10 payable to Tesco Stores Limited.
