**What information do we collect and how do we use it?**  
With your permission, we may collect or hold information on you such as your name and contact details, or use that already held by the Tesco Group to occasionally notify you about important changes to services or to manage your account.

We may also use your information and your usage history to help shape our recommendations about potential Tesco Mobile products, tariffs and services, or those of third parties, that might be of interest to you, and to inform you of these. Please contact Tesco Mobile customer care on 0870 900 4455 if you do not wish to receive such information.

We may collect additional information in connection with your participation in any promotions or competitions offered by us and information you provide when giving us feedback or completing profile forms. We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site use which enables us to improve the service we provide.

**How do we protect your details?**  
Pages that display your personal information or that ask you to enter personal information are protected by SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology, which encrypts your details as they travel between us. This ensures that the information cannot be obtained by any third party.

Furthermore, as required by the UK Data Protection Act of 1998, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information that you have given us to prevent unauthorised access. This means we request proof of identity before displaying your account details.

**Is the security of the site verified by a third party?**  
All sites that use SSL technology need to be certified. Our site is certified by Thawte, a subsidiary of VeriSign, the leading internet security company. In order to gain this certificate, we have satisfied Thawte that we have taken all the necessary measures to protect your personal information.

**How do I know if the page I'm using is secure?**  
There are two ways of knowing that a page is secure. The first is that the URL starts "https" rather than "http". The second way is from the special icon, as follows, at the foot of your browser window.

**Internet Explorer** \- look for a padlock icon on the bottom bar of the browser window. Click on it to view the security certificate.

**Netscape Communicator** \- a padlock on the bottom bar is locked on secure pages and unlocked on other pages. Again, click to check the security certificate.

**Netscape Navigator** \- a key icon is shown on secure pages. Go to the 'View' menu and choose 'Document Info' to inspect the certificate.

**What about "cookies"?**  
Our cookies do not contain personally identifying information or passwords. They simply enable us to recognise existing customers when they come to the website. This means customers will be shown the log-in page rather than the home page when they visit us.
