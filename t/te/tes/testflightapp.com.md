# TestFlight » Beta Testing On The Fly

* * *

TestFlight App Inc. (the “Company”, “we” or “us”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from Developers and Beta Testers on [www.testflightapp.com](http://www.testflightapp.com/) (the “Website”) and from Users, Developers and Beta Testers through TestFlight or TestFlight Live (collectively, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy applies to information that is provided to us through the Website or that we receive through the Services. Our Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time, and we will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Website at [www.testflightapp.com/privacy](http://www.testflightapp.com/privacy). This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites, applications or services that display or link to different privacy statements. 

YOU ARE HEREBY ADVISED THAT YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE WEBSITE AND THE SERVICES CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, ANY APPLICABLE CURRENT AND PRIOR VERSIONS, AND ANY AMENDMENTS THERETO. 

  1. ###  Understanding the Services and types of users. 

The website provides two different types of services available to three types of user. 

    1. The first service is TestFlight which is available to App Developers (“Developers”) and beta testers (“Beta Testers”). Both the Developer and the Beta Tester must sign up at the Website to utilize this service. 

    2. The second service is TestFlight Live which is available to Developers and App users (“Users”). TestFlight Live allows Developers to receive real time analytics from Users so that Developers may improve App performance. A User does not sign up on the Website. 

Both services operate differently and are addressed separately where applicable in the sections below. 

  2. ###  Information Collection: 

Personally Identifiable Information that we collect from TestFlight’s Developers and Beta Testers through the Website. 

In the course of using the Website, Developers and Beta Testers may provide us with certain personally identifiable information. This refers to information about Developers and Beta Testers that can be used to contact or identify them, and information on their use of and activities at the Website that may be connected with them (“Website Personal Information”). Website Personal Information that we collect may include, but is not limited to, a Developer or Beta Tester’s name, telephone number, credit card details or other billing information, email address, home and business postal addresses, and Apple iOS Unique Device Identifier (UDID). Website Personal Information may also include information Developers or Beta Testers supply to us concerning their preferences and interests expressed in the course of use of the Website. 

When Developers or Beta Testers visit the Website to use the Service, our servers automatically record information that their browser or device provides to us. This information may include, but is not limited to, the Developer or Beta Tester’s computer or device’s Internet Protocol address, browser type, the web page it was visiting before it came to the Website and information it searches for on the Website. Like many websites, we may also use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to the Developer or Beta Tester’s computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We may use “persistent cookies” to save the Developer or Beta Tester’s registration ID and login password for future logins to the Website; and we use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Website, to better understand how Developers and Beta Testers interact with the Website and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Website. The Developer or Beta Tester can instruct its browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt before accepting a cookie from the websites it visits. If the browser does not accept cookies, however, it may not be able to access all portions of the Website or all functionality of our services. 

When a Developer or Beta Tester uploads mobile applications (“App(s)”) to the Website, we may also record certain information related thereto, such as the number of times a Developer or Beta Tester installs an App, the number of Apps a Developer or Beta Tester has access to, the number of times a Developer or Beta Tester views an App’s description, and whether a Developer or Beta Tester tries to install an App without being authorized to. It is important to note that we cannot install a Developer’s App on our devices as each App is encrypted and protected and may only be opened by authorized devices. We also cannot access the release notes or other files packaged with a Developer’s App unless access is expressly granted by the Developer to us. Apps, IPAs, provisioning profiles and other application sensitive information remain the Developer’s property and shall not be part of the Website Personal Information. We make no claim to ownership of any Apps unless created and uploaded by us. 

Information we collect from TestFlight Live’s Users through the Service. 

Users of TestFlight Live do not sign up for the service, so to prevent an intrusion of privacy we have made an effort to minimize the amount of sensitive or identifiable data provided to us by the service. 

When a Developer includes the TestFlight Live SDK in an App, we receive certain “User Information” that will help the Developer improve the App experience. User Information is comprised of: timestamp, App version, User’s device name, device model, language, carrier, architecture, network state (i.e. wifi or cellular data), events, errors and the User’s last action in the App. The User Information also includes a device identifier, such as the handset’s UDID; however, this is immediately hidden and converted into a random, proprietary, non-traceable TestFlight ID viewable only to Company and not to the Developer. 

  3. ###  How We Use Personal Information 

How we use Website Personal Information from TestFlight 

Website Personal Information is or may be used for the following purposes: (i) to provide and improve the Website, services, features and content, (ii) to administer a Developer or Beta Tester’s use of the Website, (iii) to enable a Developer or Beta Tester to enjoy and easily navigate the Website, (iv) to better understand a Developer or Beta Tester’s needs and interests, (v) to fulfill requests that a Developer or Beta Tester may make, (vi) to personalize a Developer or Beta Tester’s experience, (vii) to provide or offer software updates and product announcements, and (viii) to provide Developers or Beta Testers with further information and offers from us or third parties that we believe they may find useful or interesting, including newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information on services and products offered by us or third parties. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive any such communications, please follow the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in any of the communications sent to you, or update your “account settings” information. (See “Changing or Deleting Information” below). 

We use information we obtain by technical means (such as the automatic recording performed by our servers or through the use of cookies) for the above purposes and in order to monitor and analyze use of the Website and our services, for the Website’s technical administration, to increase the Website’s functionality and user-friendliness, to better tailor it to Developers or Beta Testers’ needs, to generate and derive useful data and information concerning the interests, characteristics and website use behavior of our users, and to verify that visitors to the Website meet the criteria required to process their requests. 

How we use User Information in TestFlight Live 

User Information will be stored on our secure services and provided to Developers to help troubleshoot crashes, discover bugs and improve Apps. We will analyze the User Information and provide it to Developers in the form of performance metrics, error reporting and user utilization information. We may also aggregate the User Information for other reporting. We will not sell or expose the User Information to third parties. Although we take best efforts to protect User Information, we are not responsible for use by any Developers of any data about their Users. Users should review the Developer’s policies to understand their use of Users’ data. 

  4. ### Information Sharing and Disclosure

Whether acquired through TestFlight or TestFlight Live, the Company does not sell, rent or share Website Personal Information or User Information without the Developer, Beta Tester or User’s consent (as appropriate), except as follows: 

    1. _Developers and Beta Testers._ We will display Website Personal Information in each Developer and Beta Tester’s profile page and elsewhere on the Website according to the preferences set in each account. Any information a Developer or Beta Tester chooses to provide should reflect how much it wants other users to know about it. We recommend that each Developer or Beta Tester guard its anonymity and sensitive information, and we encourage Developers and Beta Testers to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their profile pages. Developers and Beta Testers can review and revise their profile information at any time. 

    2. _Service Providers, Business Partners and Others._ We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform Website-related services (including but not limited to data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, payment processing, and improvement of the Website’s features) or to assist us in analyzing how the Website and Services are used. These third parties have access to your Website and User Personal Information solely for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf. We intend to make reasonable efforts to ensure that these third parties execute industry standard confidentiality agreements to protect Website and User Personal Information. 

    3. _Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement._ TestFlight cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any Website or User Personal Information to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of the Company or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical, inappropriate or legally actionable. 

    4. Right to Reference. Unless you provide express written notice otherwise, the Company shall have the right to reference and refer to the usage of, and relationship with, you or your company, which may be determined by the domain used in your registered email account. No press releases shall be made without your written consent. 

    5. Business Transfers. The Company may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including Website and User Personal Information, in connection with or in anticipation of a corporate event, including a merger, acquisition, sale of stock, recapitalization, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. 

  5. ###  Changing or Deleting Website Personal Information provided in TestFlight 

A Developer or Beta Tester may review, update, correct or delete the Website Personal Information provided in its registration or account profile for TestFlight by changing its “account settings.” 

There is no personal information provided by the User in TestFlight Live, therefore this section is not applicable. 

  6. ###  Opting Out of TestFlight Live 

A User cannot opt out of TestFlight Live and the submission of User Information, except by deleting or uninstalling the App that contains TestFlight Live. Users should contact an App’s developer to determine if the App contains TestFlight Live. 

  7. ### Security

The Company is very concerned with safeguarding and protecting all Website Personally Information and User Information. We employ reasonable measures and security designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction. These measures include encrypting sensitive information using a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and storing information behind a firewall. However, the Company cannot ensure, guarantee or warrant the security of all information held, especially against third party attacks or intrusions. Therefore all information provided to the Company is provided at the Developer, Beta Tester or User’s risk. 

  8. ###  Transfer of Information 

If you are not a resident of the United States, you understand and agree that the Company stores and processes your information on computers located in the United States, and by providing any data to the Company, you consent to the transfer of such information to the United States and the application of the laws of the United States. 

  9. ### Our Policy Toward Children

This Website is not directed to children under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect Website Personal Information or User Information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Website Personal Information or User Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at privacy@testflightapp.com. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Website Personal Information or User Information, we will delete such information from our files.

    1. Our Service Providers.
