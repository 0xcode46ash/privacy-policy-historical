As a registered user you have the option of signing in to tesa’s website using your registration data, i.e. "logging in". In such cases tesa also uses cookies to identify you as a registered customer upon a repeat visit to its website within a 28-day period and to allow you to remain logged in.  
During your first visit to tesa’s website, a popup will appear at the upper edge of the screen asking you to confirm whether you agree to the utilization of cookies. The button provided can be used to agree. If you change your mind later on, simply delete all of the cookies stored by your browser.

## 8\. Social plugins 

Our websites make use of "social plugins", i.e. plugins for social networks, including particularly the Facebook "Share" button. The facebook.com website is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. Responsible for the German website facebook.de is Facebook Ireland Limited, Hanover Reach, 5-7 Hanover Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland. The plug-ins usually feature the Facebook logo. Besides Facebook, tesa uses plug-ins by Google+ (provider: Google Inc., Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA), Twitter (provider: Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market St, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103) and Pinterest (provider: Pinterest Inc., 808 Brannan Street San Francisco, CA 94103, USA).  
For data privacy reasons tesa has deliberately opted against utilizing direct social network plug-ins on our websites. Instead, tesa employs an alternative technical solution that allows you to decide whether to transmit data to the social network operators and when. Thus when you visit our sites, data are never automatically transmitted to social networks such as Facebook, Google, Twitter or Pinterest. Only when you actively click on the respective button yourself will your web browser connect to the servers of the respective social network, i.e. clicking on elements then clicking on the social network's icon indicates your consent to your browser connecting to the servers of the respective social network and sending usage data to that social network operator.  
tesa has no influence over the nature or scope of data that social networks may then gather. For information regarding the purpose and scope of data collection, further processing and use of data by social networks and regarding your data privacy rights and relevant configuration settings, see the social networks' respective data privacy advisories. For Facebook see <http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/> und <http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=186325668085084>. 

More information on data usage by Google+ and Twitter can be found at <http://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/> bzw. <http://twitter.com/privacy>, and for Pinterest at <http://about.pinterest.com/privacy/>.
