# Privacy Policy

tesa is aware that the protection of personal data and its confidential handling is of great concern to our users. We would therefore like to illustrate below what information we collect and how we handle it. 

## Updating of this privacy policy

Due to constant technical and legal innovations, we must amend or update the existing declaration from time to time. Please check each time before you use our website when the last version of the conditions was posted on the website. The most recent post was in August 2001. 

## Information collected

We gather collective data, i.e. data on the number of visitors to our website and the pages which they visit. The name of the file, the date and time of the call, the volume of data transferred and a message regarding whether the call was successful is saved for each call. This information gives us information on the general interests and preferences of our visitors. 

The data is not person-related, but only of a general, statistical nature. We are therefore unable to determine which users have called up what data. In addition, we automatically gather and save information which is transferred by your browser, in particular your IP address and the version of browser software. This data is a foundation stone of the Internet\'s fundamental technology and is used solely for system administration purposes and to ensure that our pages are transmitted correctly. 

When you send e-mails to us by clicking on [contact](https://web.archive.org/contact) or request information material from us at other locations, we ask for your name, address, e-mail address, profession and age. This data is retained. Please note that it is not compulsory to provide all of this information; you can to a large extent determine for yourself what information you wish to entrust us with. 

The compulsory data is required so that we can complete the service which you have requested from us. Naturally, you may also remain anonymous or use a pseudonym. All the data is stored or processed separately and at no time is it brought together. Tesa does not create user profiles. 

## Length of storage and deletion

Personal data is stored for 36 months or at the time the services that you requested are provided. Naturally you have the right to request at any time that your data be wholly or partly deleted. We will carry out such a request without delay. 

## Cookies

Cookies are small text files which may be stored on the hard drive of a visitor to a website. The information contained in the cookies facilitates the navigation of the website and enables you to have personal settings on the website. For these reasons, we currently use cookies on our site. They have a time limit. 

Naturally, you can prevent the cookies being saved on your hard drive by changing your browser settings. You can find out how to do this for your browser in the user instructions of your browser manufacturer. 

## Passing on information to third parties

tesa does not pass on the collected data to third parties; specifically, it is not sold, leased out or exchanged. Only when we must use subcontractors or agents to perform the services which you have requested from us, do we supply the necessary data to these parties. In such cases, our partners are required to handle the data confidentially in accordance with statutory provisions and to delete it immediately that it is no longer required. 

Therefore, please understand that as we are unable to comprehensively check that this obligation is complied with, we bear no liability for any possible infringements.
