**Your privacy is important to us.**   
For this reason, we have established a privacy policy that safeguards your personal information, and we are committed to protecting its confidentiality:

  * We will limit the collection and use of personal information to what is necessary to administer our business, provide you with the highest quality service, and offer you opportunities we think will be of interest. 
  * We will _not_ disclose any individual information except in the limited circumstances described below. 
  * We wholeheartedly support strong and effective privacy guidelines and practices on the Web and believe that these will enhance everyone’s use of the Web.



**What information do we gather or track about you?  
**We collect information about you when you register with us or purchase products from us, from our use of "cookies" and other tracking technology as you access our web site, and when you email us. (A "cookie" is information we place on your computer to help us identify you or your preferences or interests as reflected by your visits to our website.)

**What do we do with this information?  
**First and foremost, we use cookies to make it easier for you to use TESSCO.com, by referencing that information so you don’t have to re-register. We use personal information you provide to us – such as your name and address, telephone or fax number, or e-mail address –to fulfill your orders, to contact you with questions or information about your orders, and to provide you with information that you request. We may also use this information and information about your interests and preferences in our continuing efforts to keep our customers and friends informed about new and exciting products, services, and promotions that we offer, which may include mailings, telephone calls, and e-mail mailings.

**With whom do we share this information?  
**We do not engage in the practice of selling our customer lists or customer information to third parties. We do from time to time, however, engage in joint marketing or other similar arrangements with responsible companies, and in the course of these activities we may share our customer information with them. This sharing may result in your receiving communications from such parties, but we do this solely because we believe that the information communicated to you by such parties will be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive these kinds of communications, you may so indicate when you register with us or by contacting us via e-mail or in writing.

Except for this sharing, we will not intentionally disclose any personal information about you unless we are required to do so by law. We use reasonable precautions to keep your personal information secure and to disclose it only to third parties we believe will use it appropriately. We are not responsible, however, for breaches of security or for any actions of third parties who receive the information. We also link to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of other web sites, and we urge you to examine their policies before disclosing any information.

**A few more words about "cookies"  
**We use "cookies" to enable you to properly access, display, or read information on our web site, to permit information to follow you from page to page, and to keep track of your interests and preferences. You can set your browser to alert you whenever you are about to receive a "cookie" and then you can choose not to accept it. If you do so, however, you may not be able to use TESSCO.com.

**How to contact us  
**If you wish to contact us – to correct personal information or elect not to receive communications either from us or from third parties or just to ask us any questions about these matters – e-mail us at [ecom@TESSCO.com](mailto:ecom@tessco.com).
