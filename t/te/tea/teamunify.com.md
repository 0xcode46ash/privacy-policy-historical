## Intended Users of the TeamUnify Website

The TeamUnify Website is intended for adults only. By accessing, browsing, or using the TeamUnify Website, you affirm (i) that you are eighteen (18) years old or older, or that you are between the ages of thirteen (13) and seventeen (17) and possess legal parental consent or guardian consent to use the TeamUnify Website and provide information through the TeamUnify Website; and (ii) that you have authority to agree to this Privacy Statement and are competent and capable of understanding and complying with this Privacy Statement. The TeamUnify Website is not directed at children under the age of thirteen (13). TeamUnify does not and will not knowingly permit submission of Personal Information by anyone under thirteen (13) years of age through the TeamUnify Website. TeamUnify does not and will not knowingly contact children under the age of thirteen (13) for marketing purposes.

## Information from Children under Age Thirteen – SWIM TEAM WEBSITEs

We recognize that children under age thirteen (13) may want to register for accounts through and use the Swim Team Websites. Before we allow a child under age thirteen (13) to register for an account through a Swim Team Website or to otherwise provide us Personal Information through use of a Swim Team Website, we first obtain consent from the child's parent or guardian for the child to use the applicable Swim Team Website and provide us Personal Information through the use of the Swim Team Website.

When a child under age thirteen (13) tries to register for an account on a Swim Team Website or otherwise provide us Personal Information through a Swim Team Website, we collect the child's e-mail address (or that of a parent or guardian) solely for the purpose of contacting the parent or guardian to request consent. We send the child and/or parent or guardian an email directed to the parent or guardian and provide the parent or guardian forty-eight (48) hours to respond with his or her consent to allow the child to register for an account on the Swim Team Website or otherwise provide us Personal Information through use of the Swim Team Website. If the parent or guardian refuses to allow the child to register for an account on the Swim Team Website or otherwise provide us Personal Information through the Swim Team Website, or if the parent or guardian does not provide consent within forty-eight (48) hours of when we requested consent, we delete the child's email address (as well as the parent or guardian email address) from our database and do not allow the child to register for an account or otherwise provide us Personal Information through use of the Swim Team Website.

Before allowing a child under age thirteen (13) to use any feature of a Swim Team Website that might result in public disclosure of the child's Personal Information, comments, or content to the public, we require a high level of verification to confirm that the parent or guardian has given permission for the child to participate in such features and activities. For example, we may require the parent or guardian to return by postal mail, fax, or email a signed consent form.

When we know we are going to collect Personal Information from a child under age thirteen (13) in order to allow the child to use a certain feature of the Swim Team Website, we take the following steps to protect the child's privacy:

  * We notify the child's parent or guardian about our information practices with regarding to children, including the types of Personal Information we may collect from children, how we collect that information, the uses to which we may put that information, and whether and with whom we may share that information;
  * In accordance with applicable law, we obtain consent from the child's parent or guardian for the collection and use of Personal Information from the child, and/or for sending information about our products and services to the child directly (see discussion of our procedure for obtaining consent directly above);
  * We limit our collection of Personal Information from the child to no more than is reasonably necessary to allow the child to use the particular feature(s) of the Swim Team Website that the child wants to use; 
  * We provide the child's parent or guardian the option to consent to our collection and use of the child's Personal Information, without consenting to our disclosure of that information to third parties; and
  * Providing the child's parent or guardian access, or the ability to request access, to the Personal Information we have collected from the child and the child's account, as well as the ability to request that the child's Personal Information be changed or deleted. The child's parent or guardian may also provide us notice that the parent or guardian refuses to allow any further collection or use of the child's Personal Information at any time, and that the child's account be deleted.



## Security

TeamUnify uses commercially-reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial security measures to assist in protecting against the loss, misuse, and alteration of Personal Information that is under our control. When the TeamUnify Website and/or any Swim Team Websites are accessed using Internet Explorer version 6.0 or later, Firefox version 2.0 or later, or Safari version 3.0 or later, Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) technology protects your Personal Information using both server authentication and data encryption. These technologies help ensure that your Personal Information is safe, secure, and only available to you through use of your username and password. TeamUnify hosts the TeamUnify Website and Swim Team Websites in a secure server environment that uses firewalls and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. TeamUnify also offers enhanced security features that permit Customers to configure security settings to their level of comfort.

Here are additional security measures we take:

**Physical Security**  
Our production equipment is collocated at a facility that provides 24-hour physical security, redundant electrical generators, and other backup equipment designed to keep servers continually up and running. 

**Data Encryption**  
TeamUnify leverages encryption products to protect customer data and communications, including 128-bit Thawte SSL Certification. The lock icon in the browser indicates that data is shielded from access while in transit. 

**Customer Authentication**  
Customers access the TeamUnify Website and/or Swim Team Websites only with a valid and unique user name and password combination, which is encrypted via SSL while in transmission. Customers are prevented from choosing weak or obvious passwords. Customers must enter their user name and password for each log in.

TeamUnify issues a session cookie only to record encrypted authentication information for the duration of a specific session. The session cookie does not include either the username or password of the Customer. TeamUnify does not use session cookies to store other Personal Information or session information, but instead implements more advanced security methods based on dynamic data and encoded session IDs.

**Operating System Security**  
TeamUnify provides operating system-level security by using a minimal number of access points to all production servers. We protect all operating system accounts with strong passwords, and production servers do not share a master password database. All operating systems are maintained at each vendor's recommended patch levels for security and are hardened by disabling and/or removing any unnecessary users, protocols, and processes. 

**Database Security**  
Whenever possible, database access is controlled at the operating system and database connection level for additional security. Access to production databases is limited to a number of points, and production databases do not share a master password database. 

**Server Management Security**  
TeamUnify employees do not have direct access to the TeamUnify production equipment, except where necessary for system management, maintenance, monitoring, and backups. The TeamUnify engineering team provides all system management, maintenance, monitoring, and backups.

Special notice regarding the security of TeamUnify's OnDeck software application 

Data downloaded into the OnDeck application is not secure and is at risk for potential inadvertent use by a non-authorized person that takes possession of the device on which the OnDeck application has been installed. The OnDeck application requires that a User Login be entered every time a Customer wants to use the application to help improve protection of the data that is stored within the OnDeck application database that resides on the device. However, a Customer may set a preference once signed in that will remember the password by automatically populating the password field. Setting this preference is not recommended and will make the device less secure. Customers will be warned of this again when they go to set the user preference. Customers are solely responsible for protecting the security of their devices and the downloaded data on their device. TeamUnify is not responsible or liable for the loss of a device and the stored data and/or inadvertent use by another party.

Unfortunately, no data storage system, or system of transmitting data over the Internet, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of our servers or any Personal Information provided to us in connection with your use of the TeamUnify Website or any Swim Team Website.

## Security Researchers: TeamUnify Vulnerability Reporting Policy
