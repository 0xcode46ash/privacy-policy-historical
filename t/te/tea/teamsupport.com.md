## Muroc Systems, Inc. Privacy Policy

Muroc Systems, Inc. ("Muroc") maintains a strict policy to ensure the privacy of our customers and visitors. Simply put, we will not release information about you (including your full name, mailing address, phone number) to any third party without your consent unless:  


  * We are required to under law.
  * The product you are using becomes owned by another party either through a merger or acquisition.
  * Muroc also reserves the right to disclose information to a third party if Muroc is contemplating a business transaction with that third party and the data is relevant to that discussion. Muroc will only release data if the third party is bound by a privacy policy at least as strict at Muroc's.



**Information Gathered**  
Muroc gathers a variety of information about our visitors and customers, including, but not limited to, IP address, referring page, pages visited, and the length of time you spend on the site. In addition, Muroc uses Cookies to both track visitors on the website as well as to remember client's usernames when they log into the application. People who sign up to use one of Muroc's applications (collectively customers) will be required to provide additional information such as address, phone number, and billing information.

Each party agrees that: (a) the Confidential Information constitutes valuable trade secrets of the party owning such Confidential Information; (b) it will use Confidential Information solely in accordance with the provisions of this policy and our [Terms of Use and Service](http://teamsupport.com/terms.php); and (c) it will not disclose, or permit to be disclosed, the Confidential Information of the other party to any third party without the disclosing party's prior written consent.

**Blogs & User Forums**  
Muroc may provide blogs or user forums on the Company's Web sites. Any personally identifiable information you choose to submit in such a forum may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages. Muroc is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.  


**Information Uses**  
Muroc may use the information gathered for billing, identification, authentication, service improvements, and contact including internal marketing efforts.

**Security Measures**  
We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) when using or accessing Muroc's applications. This encrypts the data being transmitted to and from you and the Muroc application. In addition, billing information is encrypted in our databases for your protection.

**Data Storage**  
Muroc owns the data storage, databases, and all intellectual property rights for our applications, but you retain ownership to all data you input into the system. In addition, all data is backed up multiple times each day and run on redundant servers that are in a secure facility at the Infomart in Dallas where we are located. Only key card access is allowed and there is 24/7/365 electronic and human security in place. Data is backed up locally on another server and is also backed up offsite - as is our code base.

**Changes**  
Muroc may, from time to time, change this privacy policy. If there are material changes to the policy we will either send an e-mail to the registered primary contact of our customers or post a prominent notice on our website.

**US-EU SAFE HARBOR**  
Muroc Systems uses annual self-assessments to assure compliance within the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention or personal data from the European Union. Our privacy policy above serves as our statement of adherence to the US-EU Safe Harbor Principles. We encourage you to use the contact information below to inform us of any complaints or disputes you may have regarding the use of your personal information. We will thoroughly investigate the matter internally and make every effort to attempt to resolve the issue quickly. If your dispute cannot be resolved by us internally, we agree to dispute resolution with the Better Business Bureau as our third party resolution provider.

**Privacy complaints by European Union Citizens**  
In compliance with the Safe Harbor Principles, Muroc Systems commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union (EU) citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Muroc Systems at support@teamsupport.com or by mail at Muroc Systems, Inc., 100 Highland Park Village Suite 200, Dallas, TX 75205. Muroc Systems has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Safe Harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgement of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by Muroc Systems, you may contact the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR program at: Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc., BBB EU SAFE HARBOR, 4200 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 800, Arlington, VA 22203, USA; phone 703-276-0100; web www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints
