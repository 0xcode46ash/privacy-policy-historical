# Privacy Policy

**SUMMARY**

 ****  
We take the privacy of our users very seriously. Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about how we treat personally identifiable information. We provide this Privacy Policy because you have a right to know what information we collect, how it is protected and used, and the circumstances under which it may be disclosed. If you have comments, suggestions, questions, or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact us via email at info@TeachersPayTeachers.com or in writing to: Margo Baender,   557 Broadway, New York, NY 10012, USA. **

Online Privacy Standards.

**  
While there are no official standards governing privacy practices on the internet, we follow the principles supported by the Federal Trade Commission’s Fair Information Practices Principles, currently available at <http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/tos>. **

What This Policy Covers.

**  
This policy covers TEACHERSpayTEACHERS’ treatment of personally identifiable information that we obtain when you visit our website or use our services. We regard personally identifiable information as information that someone can use to identify or contact you in person, such as real name, telephone number, birth date, email address, or physical mailing address. Information that we use internally to identify you as a user in our system, such as your selected UserName, is not considered personally identifiable information. **

What This Policy Does Not Cover.

** This policy does not cover the privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control, such as any partners and advertisers. In addition, we may provide links to other services and on occasion to other sites that may interest you. All of these sites operate independently of TEACHERSpayTEACHERS and they have their own privacy or security practices. For your best on-line experience, we encourage you to review their policies before submitting any personal information to them. 

**  
1\. HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION** **  
**

 **A.         Information You Provide** **  
**

 **Registration Information**.   
During the registration process, we collect your email address. We will send you an email to verify that you are the owner of this address. You will also choose a UserName that we will use to identify you in our system. When you register for membership as a Teacher-Author, we will also collect your name, address, and birth date. These are mandatory items that we require when you register to be a Teacher-Author with TEACHERSpayTEACHERS. This information helps to ensure we can properly pay Teacher-Authors and ensures that the feedback loop is accurate. Also, since our service is not intended for children (see our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/web/20070704032705id_/https%3A//www.teacherspayteachers.com/index.php?method=Content&Page=TermsofService) for further information), birth date information assists us in blocking access to children. **

Member Profile Information

**.  
During the Registration process, Teacher-Authors will have the opportunity to provide a public Member Profile which is like a biography about you and the Teaching Content that you wish to make available through TEACHERSpayTEACHERS. You can choose to provide as much or as little information about yourself in your public Member Profile as you see fit. **

Access To Your Personal Information.

** In general, we make it easy for you to view any personally identifiable information we have collected from you in your Member Profile Page, where you can add, edit, or remove information as you see fit. You can always access your Member Profile Page by logging in to your “Manage My Account” pages at this link: [http://www.TEACHERSpayTEACHERS.com.](http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/) **

S

** **ocial Security Numbers**.   
For Teacher-Authors who earn more than $600 in a calendar year, we will require the Teacher-Author to provide his or her social security number or tax identification number. We use the social security number or tax identification number for the sole purpose of filing a Form-1099 with the United States IRS for the Teacher-Author. Otherwise the Teacher-Author's social security number or tax identification number will be protected. Any Teacher-Author whose payments from TeachersPayTeachers cross the $600 threshold will be sent a notice requesting their social security number or tax identification number for this purpose. Until we receive this information from the Teacher-Author, we will be unable to send further payments to the Teacher-Author.

 **B.         Information We Do Not Collect From or About ****Children**.   
As explained further in our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/web/20070704032705id_/https%3A//www.teacherspayteachers.com/index.php?method=Content&Page=TermsofService), our website is intended for adults only. You must be 18 years of age or older to register to use our website. Therefore, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information about children. If you believe that we have information from or about anyone under 18 years of age, please notify us by email at privacy@TEACHERSpayTEACHERS.com or write to our Privacy Director at the address noted above.  ****

**C.         Information We Track** **  
**

 **Log Files**.   
Like many websites, we gather certain anonymous, non-personal information automatically and store it in web server log files. This information includes internet protocol addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), site entry/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to improve our site, analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements around the site, and gather aggregate information about our user base as a whole. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of services or users from which individual user identities have been removed, and therefore does not include your personally identifiable information.

 **Cookies**.   
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. It can also help us understand how our site visitors click to our site, and what pages they view during their visit.

 **Communication of Service-related Announcements**.  
We use emails and/or prominent notifications on our website as our primary means to inform our users of service-related announcements from TEACHERSpayTEACHERS. We may use your email address to deliver important service-related announcements. Example service-related announcements include: email verification during registration, requests for a password reset, important security or server maintenance updates, software updates, upgrades, and new releases, or policy changes.

Teacher-Buyers are also given an opportunity to provide feedback about the Teaching Content they have purchased and used. Thus, in providing this service, we depend in part on the contributions and actions of our Members to improve the quality of the experience that Members have with the Service. When you post information to TEACHERSpayTEACHERS (such as posting Teaching Content, describing Teaching Content, adding a comment or giving feedback about Teaching Content you have purchased, asking or answering questions through the “Teacher-Author Q/A” feature), you will be identified by your UserName (if you are a Teacher-Buyer) and by your real name (if you are a Teacher-Author) as the author of that post, comment, or action.

Teacher-Authors are required to provide their real names which will be visible to all users. You will have the option to include other personally identifiable information in your public Member Profile, but you are not required to do so.
