## A. WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT

Teaching Strategies collects Member Data, Student Data, and Portfolio Data. The Data includes Personally Identifiable Information (PII) which means information that may identify an individual Student or Member. Teaching Strategies always complies with applicable laws, regulations, industry standards, and contracts and agreements pertaining to the safeguarding of PII. The Data are provided by the authorized representative of an organization who has purchased a subscription to use the Services (an “Authorized User”). 

  1. **Member Data** is limited information that can be used to personally identify an Authorized User. This information is required before the Authorized User can access the Services (whether on a trial basis or through a paid subscription). There are three kinds of Member Data: 
    1. **Subscribers:** Organizations and Individual Subscribers are members that have purchased a subscription from Teaching Strategies to use the Services. Subscribers provide their full name, the name of their organization, their mailing and e-mail address, telephone number, and information regarding their method of payment (e.g., purchase order number). 
    2. **Group Members:** Program and Site Administrators and Teachers are members that register through a school, school district, childcare center, Head Start program, or other organization that has purchased a subscription from Teaching Strategies to use the Services. They provide us with their full name and e-mail address. 
    3. **Invited Guests:** Parents and Others are members that register to use the Services in response to an invitation from another registered member. They provide their full name and e-mail address. 
  2. **Student Data** is information that personally identifies a student and his or her Portfolio. The personally identifiable information includes first name, last name and date of birth. Student Data is stored in online Portfolios. Each Portfolio includes Documentation and Checkpoint information. 
    1. **Documentation:** Teachers observe children in the classroom and gather documentation of their learning and development over the course of the year. Documentation can be notes, photos, videos, samples of children’s artwork, and observations from families about their child’s development. 
    2. **Checkpoint:** A few times a year, teachers analyze the Portfolio Data collected during the checkpoint period and make ratings based on their observations and the documentation they have gathered. These ratings are based on a list of research-based and developmentally appropriate indicators that reflect widely held expectations for children of similar ages, classes, or grades. Completing these checkpoints allows teachers to evaluate children’s progress and show growth in the children’s learning and development over the course of the year. 

The Student Data is only provided by authorized Subscribers during the initial setup or in the development of an individual student Portfolio. 




## B. HOW WE PROTECT AND SECURE OUR USER’S INFORMATION

The security and privacy of the data held in _GOLD_ ® is one of our highest priorities. Teaching Strategies is committed to protecting the Member Data, Student Data, and Portfolio Data that we maintain on behalf of our Subscribers and their Authorized Users. We utilize and continually review appropriate technical, administrative, and physical procedures to ensure Data is protected from unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration. 

In particular: 

  1. **Data Storage and Security:** Secure data centers house all Member Data, Student Data, and Portfolio Data. These data centers are constantly monitored and tested for maximum security. Access to the data center infrastructure is strictly controlled and we adhere to industry standard administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. 
  2. **Disclosures:** The uses and disclosures of Student Data are in compliance with state and federal laws designed to protect such information. Only authorized individuals, including Teaching Strategies employees and subcontractors, have access to children’s portfolio items and their authorization is constantly reviewed and verified by a cross functional working group, which includes the Information Security Officer, and senior Legal and HR staff. 
  3. **Accountability:** All Teaching Strategies employees and subcontractors are accountable for the Security and Privacy of the Member Data, Student Data, and Portfolio Data we maintain on our Subscribers’ behalf. Every employee or subcontractor who has access to Member Data, Student Data, or Portfolio Data has the responsibility to keep the information safe and to only use it for authorized educational purposes as described below. This policy applies to all computing systems, networks, business processes, and the verbal transmission of information. 



## C. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

  1. **Only for Authorized Purposes:** We only use information we collect for the educational purposes for which we were authorized by our Subscribers. 
    1. **Member Data:** We will use the Member Data provided to register the membership, set up and maintain the account, determine the number of Portfolios an Authorized User is authorized to create (if any), and which Portfolios the Authorized User is authorized to access, update, view, and/or modify. We will also use Member Data to notify Authorized Users of updates to the Site and our Services, and for contact purposes if we need more information. If an Authorized User has purchased a subscription to use the Services, we will use the financial information provided to bill the Authorized User. 

If an Authorized User has registered to use the Services through a school, school district, child care center, Head Start program, or other organization that has purchased a subscription from Teaching Strategies, the Member Data provided will be accessible by the organization that purchased the subscription, as outlined in the contract with the organization. 

    2. **Student Data:** Student Data is used to set up and maintain Portfolios and to grant other Authorized Users the right to access, update, view, and/or modify such Portfolios. Portfolio Data can be used to identify and recommend appropriate activities and customize student plans. Aggregated, non-personalized outcome group progress reports for Subscribers are also generated using Student Data. Only the Student Data provided by a Subscriber’s Authorized Users will be used to create reports for such Subscriber. We also may aggregate the Portfolio Data, with all personally identifying information about individual students, Authorized Users, organizations and programs removed, to generate reports and conduct research. From time to time we may publish the results of the aggregated, de-identified Portfolio Data. In no event will any such results permit the personal identification of students and their parents, or identify in any way the site, program, or organization. 

If an Authorized User has invited the parent or legal guardian of a child to view their child’s Portfolio, we will make the Student Data and Portfolio Data in the child’s Portfolio available to such invited guests for their review. All invited guests must register with Teaching Strategies before being granted access to a Portfolio, and the invited guest’s access will be limited to the Portfolio such guest has been invited to view. An invited guest is not authorized to modify or add to a Portfolio. 

Additionally, if the Authorized User has registered to use the Services through a school, school district, child care center, Head Start program, or other organization that has purchased a subscription from Teaching Strategies, any Student and Portfolio Data that the Authorized User provides will be accessible by the organizations that purchased the subscription, as outlined in the contract with the organization.

This includes all applicable federal laws, state laws and regulations, contractual agreements, and applicable Subscriber policies.
