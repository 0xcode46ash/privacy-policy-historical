# Teaching Strategies: Security and Privacy on TeachingStrategies.com

Security and Privacy on TeachingStrategies.com

**Our Security Policy**

**Your credit card** **and personal contact information  are safe when you buy from TeachingStrategies.com!**

The Teaching Strategies online bookshop runs on a secure server, which means that orders placed with most web browsers will be encrypted--garbled as it is sent through the Internet, preventing it from being intercepted and read by unauthorized personnel.  We also have instant credit authorization so that your credit card is charged instantly and the number is discarded the second the process is complete. We never store your credit card information. In fact, no human eyes ever see your credit card number! 

We employ Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. SSL encrypts your credit card number as it travels over the Internet. This makes doing business over the Internet as secure as purchasing by telephone or making a purchase in a store. Once your credit card is processed with our instant authorization process, it is deleted, and thus safe from those who should not have access.

Whenever your credit card information is requested or displayed, you'll notice that the Internet URL address begins with "https." The "s" in the address means that our secure server has queried your computer's Web browser software and asked it to encrypt all information before transmitting it. This encryption is performed using an industry-standard security protocol known as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). SSL is a feature included in most modern Internet browsers, including Netscape, Internet Explorer, Compuserve 3.0 or higher and AOL 2.0 or higher. Information encrypted with SSL is nearly impossible for unauthorized parties to decode. All major Internet stores use this technology, and it has been approved by the major credit card companies. A valid certificate means that you can have confidence that you are sending information to the right place and you'll know you are doing business at a secure site when you see an unbroken  icon in your status bar. When your browser is in "secure" mode it encrypts all the information between itself and the server.  Encrypted information looks like meaningless garbage to eavesdroppers, so your personal information is secure.

**Our Privacy Policy**

**Your information is safe with Teaching Strategies!** We know that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust.  **WE DO NOT EVER SELL IT**   **TO** **OR SHARE IT** **WITH OTHERS.**

**What Personal Information About Customers Does TSI Gather?**

  * **Account Information** : We receive and store the contact information you give us if you set up an account (sometimes referred to as "become a member" or "join our community." )  We do not store credit card numbers for your protection.  We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing training for you, improving our services, and communicating with you about our products and services. 


  * **Order or Registration Information:** In the process of making a purchase through our bookshop or registering for a conference online, you will be asked to provide contact and billing information. If you opt not to create an account with Teaching Strategies, this information will only be used to process your order or registration. 


  * **Automatic Information** : We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses TeachingStrategies.com. This information is SAFE! We do not use it to send "pop-up" advertising, or sell the information to other companies...NEVER!

Examples of the information we collect include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login; e-mail address; password; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; purchase history; the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our Web site, including date and time; and cookie number.  


  * **E-mail Communications** : If you place an order with us, we will only use your e-mail address to communicate with you regarding your order UNLESS you sign up for our e-mail newsletter or our e-mail discussion list.  When you subscribe to these lists, you are giving permission for us to communicate with you. If you sign up for the e-mail discussion list, you are also providing permission for others in the discussion group to send you emails.  We use our e-mail lists judiciously! We are careful to limit the e-mail we send to you to once or twice a month, and only when it is of benefit to you. 




> It's easy to unsubscribe from our lists, and each e-mail you get from either of our lists will contain information about how to unsubscribe. But, if you ever have trouble getting off one of our lists, please complete our online [ **Inquiry Form**](https://web.archive.org/bookshop/CustomerInquiry.cfm), or [**email our webmaster**](mailto:Webmaster@TeachingStrategies.com) and a real-live, honest-to-goodness human being will remove your name from the list!

**  
What About Cookies?**

  * Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as saving your shopping cart, retaining your conference waiting lists, and other features. 


  * The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of our most important features, and **we recommend that you leave them turned on**.   




**Does TeachingStrategies.com Share the Information It Receives?**

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and **WE DO NOT EVER SELL IT**   **OR SHARE IT** **WITH OTHERS.**   

**How Secure Is Information About Me?**

  * We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input during the checkout process. 


  * We employ instant credit card verification. Once your credit card number is verified, it is deleted, with the exception of the last five digits which are encrypted by SSL.


  * We retain only the last five digits of your credit card numbers for identification purposes if a refund becomes necessary. 


  * It is important for you to protect yourself against unauthorized access to your password or to your computer. Be sure to LOG OFF when you are finished using the TeachingStrategies.com website, especially if you are using a shared computer. Make sure you store your password in a secure location, and never share it with others. This is particularly important if your company uses the "bill later" credit account feature, which authorizes us to invoice your company when an order is placed.



**Where can I view, modify or update the contact information you have?**

> Each time you log on to TeachingStrategies.com you will see your profile.  We suggest that you review your profile and keep it current at all times.

**What Choices Do I Have?**

  * You can visit our site and take advantage of the free content without providing any information at all! 


  * When you make a purchase, you can bypass the account set up process. This means that the contact information we need to bill, ship and process your order will be stored in the database solely for the purpose of fulfilling your order.  This information cannot be retrieved on the TeachingStrategies.com website. The next time you make a purchase, you will have to re-enter this data. 


  * The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, you will not be able to take advantage of many important features on the Teaching Strategies site if you do not use cookies. 



**Still Concerned?**

If you have any concern about privacy at TeachingStrategies.com, please complete our online [ **Inquiry Form**](https://web.archive.org/bookshop/CustomerInquiry.cfm), or  [**email our webmaster**](mailto:Webmaster@TeachingStrategies.com) **,** a real-live, honest-to-goodness person, and we will try to clear up your concerns.
