The Website Privacy Policy relates to the collection and use of personal information you may supply to us through your conduct on the website. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to modify or remove portions of this Website Privacy Policy at any time. This Website Privacy Policy is in addition to any other terms and conditions applicable to the website..

We understand the importance of protecting the privacy of information collected about visitors to our website, in particular information that is capable of identifying you as an individual or as a customer ("personal information"). This Website Privacy Policy governs the manner in which your personal information, obtained through the website, will be dealt with. This Website Privacy Policy should be reviewed periodically so that you are updated on any changes. We welcome your comments and feedback.

#### Personal Information

Personal information about visitors to our website is collected only when knowingly and voluntarily submitted. For example, we may need to collect such information to allow you to login to the website or to supply you with products ordered through the website or to answer or forward any requests or enquiries. It is our intention that this policy will protect your personal information from being dealt with in any way that is inconsistent with applicable privacy laws in Australia and New Zealand.

Personal information that visitors submit to our website is used only for the purpose for which it is submitted or for such other secondary purposes that are related to the primary purpose, unless we disclose other uses in this Website Privacy Policy or at the time of collection. Copies of correspondence sent from the website, that may contain personal information, are stored as archives for record-keeping and back-up purposes only.

#### Disclosure

Apart from where you have consented or disclosure is necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was submitted, personal information may be disclosed in special situations where we have reason to believe that doing so is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against anyone damaging, injuring, or interfering (intentionally or unintentionally) with our rights or property, users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. Also, we may disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that the law requires disclosure.

We may engage third parties to provide you with goods or services on our behalf. In that circumstance, we may disclose your personal information to those third parties in order to meet your request for goods or services.

In addition, our employees and the contractors who provide services related to our information systems are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by us. However, we will not be held responsible for events arising from unauthorised access to your personal information.

If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature.
