## Web Site Privacy

**Information Tracked**

At times we may use your IP address when necessary to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our web site. We also may track browser types to help us understand our visitors' needs related to our web site design. To the extent feasible, we will do so in a way that makes your personal information non-personally identifiable by aggregating data or removing identifying characteristics.

There are registration and application sections of our web site where input forms require your name, e-mail address and other information. By submitting such forms, you give us permission to send email messages to you containing information relating to your interest in Teach For America. Each email we send will also contain instructions for how to opt-out of receiving future emails of any sort from Teach For America.

**Cookies**

Client-side cookies are used to verify the login status of visitors and registered users of our web site. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. If visitors reject a cookie, they may still use our site; however, they may not be able to log in, or access all areas of our site. (Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences.)

**Security and Privacy**

Teach For America's web site uses security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We store the information in a database in a secure environment at our secure data center.

We will never share, sell, or rent your individual personal information with or to any individual or organization without your advance permission or unless ordered by a court of law. Information submitted to us is only available to employees managing this information for purposes of contacting you, processing your application, or sending you e-mails related to your interest in Teach For America.

**Links to other Web Sites**

Teach For America is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any other web sites to which we link.

**Choice/Opt-out**

Our e-newsletter subscribers and website visitors are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information.

Users of our site will always be notified if their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this to ensure that our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.

**Third Party Agreement**

This site works with a third party that collects anonymous traffic data at this site. To find out more, please go to [www.websidestory.com/privacy](http://www.websidestory.com/privacy).

**Compliance with Laws**

We may disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena.

**Notification of Changes**

If we change our privacy policy, we will prominently post these changes to ensure that our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email at the last address provided and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our website. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. Any change to this Privacy Policy will be effective one week following either our sending an email notice to you or notice of the changes on our website. Any such changes may affect our use and sharing of personal information that you provided to us before our notification to you of the changes. If you do not wish to permit changes in our collection, use, or sharing of personal information that you have provided to us before the effective date of such changes, you must notify us before that effective date. Please be advised, however, that regardless of whether you provide such notice to us, the changes to this Privacy Policy will apply to any personal information that you provide to us on of after the effective date of such changes.
