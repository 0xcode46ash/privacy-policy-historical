In order to improve your shopping experience, Teavana does partner with other companies: 

  To better understand our visitors preferences and shopping experience, Teavana uses Coremetrics to analyze visitors. We use cookies on your system to understand how our categories, products, and content data function over time. We use this information to improve our website, personalize the website and other marketing information, responding to customer problems, and communicating with you in the future. 

  Teavana has arranged with PowerReviews, Inc (d/b/a Buzzillions) (“PowerReviews”) to manage customer product reviews on our products. When you submit a product review to Your Company, you are also subject to PowerReviews’ terms of use and privacy policies (see details [here](http://www.buzzillions.com/public/legal/index_en_US.html)).
