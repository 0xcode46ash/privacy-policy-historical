How we protect your information 

When you order from us on-line at [www.teach12.com](http://www.teach12.com/), we protect your information by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.  SSL encryption electronically codes any information you send us.  With this state-of-the-art system, you can enter your credit-card number, delivery and billing information safely through the secure server.  The encryption process protects the information by scrambling it before it is sent to us from your computer. 

If you feel uncomfortable with buying on-line, we’re still taking orders by phone 1-800-TEACH-12 (1-800-832-2412), fax (703-378-3819), or surface mail (4151 Lafayette Center Drive; Suite 100; Chantilly, VA 20151-1232).
