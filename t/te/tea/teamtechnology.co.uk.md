### Overview

Any information you provide is used only to operate this website and provide you with information and/or services that you ask for. We do not use your information for marketing purposes, nor pass it to anyone else for marketing. How we collect and use your information is detailed below. In summary, the main points are:

  * The only time we pass your information to anyone else is if you purchase a report. In that case, we pass your details automatically to Paypal so they can process your payment, and they pass details of your transaction back to us.
  * As with most websites, our system keeps logs to record how the website is used. These logs are anonymous, except for log entries related to report purchases.
  * There are a small number of other cases, detailed below, where we may need to pass your data to someone else for technical/legal reasons (e.g., if we sell the business).
