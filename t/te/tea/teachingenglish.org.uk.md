# Privacy | British Council

The British Council creates international opportunities for the people of the UK and other countries and builds trust between them worldwide. We are committed to ensuring that personal information is protected and managed in accordance with UK law, international good practice and individuals’ rights. We collect and use personal information in order to help us offer individuals appropriate information, products and services.

This policy will apply to all locations where we operate, including where local regulations do not exist. Where different privacy and data protection laws are in place in different countries, we will comply with those laws insofar as they meet internationally accepted privacy principles and fair information practices.

### When asking people for their personal information, the British Council is committed to the following:

  * explaining why we need personal information and only asking for the information we need
  * protecting the information we are given and making sure that only those who need access are able to do so
  * only sharing the information within the British Council and with other organisations where such sharing is necessary or where we have the individual’s consent.



### We also undertake to:

  * adopt and maintain a procedure which allows people to request access to the personal information we hold on them and which allows them to complain where they believe we have mishandled their information in some way
  * not keep personal information for longer than necessary
  * take measures to protect the rights and freedoms of individuals whose personal information may be transferred to countries with differing data protection laws.



We will provide adequate and appropriate resources to implement this policy and will ensure it is communicated and understood.

The British Council will review this global policy statement annually to reflect new legal and regulatory developments and ensure good practice.

This global policy statement was approved by Martin Davidson, Chief Executive, in February 2014 and is due for review in February 2015.
