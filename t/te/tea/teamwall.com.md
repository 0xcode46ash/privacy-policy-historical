**  
Introduction**

SportsSignup takes privacy and data protection issues seriously. We have designed this Privacy Policy to explain how we handle personal information collected from participants who register for services and submit information to SportsSignup through the Internet.

As the SportsSignup services evolve, we may revise this policy, so please check back frequently. If you have questions about SportsSignup’s privacy practices please contact us at [privacy@sportssignup.com](mailto:privacy@sportssignup.com).

SportsSignup is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Our Privacy Policy is posted below to help you understand the care with which Personal Information is treated whenever you use our web site.

**  
Scope of this Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy covers SportsSignup’s treatment of personal information collected from individuals, families and teams (hereafter “Registrant” or “Registrants”) who use the SportsSignup services, as well as consumer information that we acquire in the course of our business. All users of SportsSignup are adults over the age of 18, who are either completing a registration to participate themselves or are completing registration(s) for their minor children. Therefore, any references to a “Registrant” in this Privacy Policy could refer to a minor child or to an adult, with the assumption that all data for any minor child is entered by the adult parent/guardian of that child. Please refer to the section of this Privacy Policy entitled “Policy for Minors” for more information.    

This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that SportsSignup does not own or control, or to people that SportsSignup does not employ or manage.

**  
Personal Information**

The SportsSignup system collects information about Registrants on behalf of the organization (“Customer”) in which a Registrant is participating, for use by the Customer. SportsSignup acts as an agent in collecting information from Registrant for the Customer and produces a variety of reports and notification for the Customer about Registrants. The Personal Information we collect on the site includes first name, last name, email address, mailing address, birthdate, grade, medical information (e.g. allergies, doctor name, etc.), and any information the Customer may choose to collect.

Personal Information is protected by a password that Registrant chooses.  Users should assure that the password selection is not obvious (name, address, etc.) and should change it periodically. Personal Information is stored in Microsoft's SQL Server Database, which supports industry standard security.  The Database is hosted by Amazon Web Services(AWS), a top-grade hosting company and Microsoft Certified Partner.

Registrants can add their photograph, primarily for Customer administrators and/or coaches to identify participants, or to facilitate the printing of a photo-based identification card. If a Registrant is uncomfortable with a photograph as part of their account information, they should delete it (or not add one). 

**  
Teams**

Customer administrators have the ability to create and manage “Teams”. A Team is defined as a group of Registrants, typically referred to as a “Team Roster” or “Roster”, that are co-participants during a sport season. For example, a soccer Team might consist of 15 players and 3 coaches/assistant coaches, who are all considered “Team Members”. 

**  
Teams: Public Information**

The Personal Information that may be shared publicly for the purpose of generating a Team Roster is last name, first initial, Team name and jersey number.  Besides the basic Team Roster information, unless otherwise specified herein, other Personal Information collected is not shared with any party other than the authorized representatives of the Customer, unless we are required to do so to complete a requirement for a Customer. For example, Registrant information may be sent as part of a Team Roster submission process from the Customer to Customer’s parent organization(s). Registrants are advised to check with their organization regarding the use and privacy of Personal Information collected on behalf of the Customer.

**  
Teams: Personal Information Sharing**

The Registrant’s “Contact Information”, consisting of first name, last name, parent/guardian name(s), parent/guardian mailing address, parent/guardian phone number(s), parent/guardian email address(es) and are available as “view only” fields by other Team Members, and are only accessible if a) the Registrant has been placed on a Team Roster by a Customer administrator; b) the Team Roster has been made accessible by a Customer administrator; c) the Registrant (other Team Member) viewing the information has logged in using their unique username and password; and d) the Registrant has not disabled the sharing function for any of the fields mentioned above.

The Registrant’s Contact Information as described above, including any emergency contact information and medical information (e.g. allergies to be aware of, Registrant’s doctor, etc.) as specified by the Registrant, is always shared with Team Members identified as “Privileged Helpers”. A Privileged Helper is typically someone designated by a Customer administrator as a coach, assistant coach, or manager, or similar roles that require access to such information to communicate with Team Members or to contact someone in the case of an emergency. Conversely, Contact Information about Privileged Helpers is always shared with other Team Members, so Team Members have a way to contact their coach, etc. Please contact the organization you are participating with if you have questions about what roles are considered Privileged Helpers.

Team information sharing is strictly limited to Personal Information of adults. Personal Information about children on Team Rosters, with the exception of their first and last name, are never shared with other Team Members. At any time, Registrants can modify their sharing settings such that no additional Personal Information (with the exception of first and last name) will be shared with Team Members.

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.

We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information _only as necessary_   _to provide_ these services to us.

  
**Policy for Minors**

SportsSignup’s services are not directed to children under the age of 13, SportsSignup does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13, as accounts are created and owned by adults over the age of 18, and any required information regarding children is entered by the adult account owner. This policy is reinforced by [SportsSignup’s Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use) and to by all Registrants during account creation. Children should always ask parents for permission before providing any Personal Information online. No information should be submitted to or posted on this site by any minor (a user under 18 years of age) without the consent of a parent or guardian. If you are aware that your child has provided us Personal Information without your consent, please contact us at [support@sportssignup.com](mailto:support@sportssignup.com).

**  
Updating/Correcting Personal Information**

For SportsSignup account holders and end users, Personal Information collected (e.g. name, address, phone numbers, etc.) can be updated, deleted or modified by logging into your SportsSignup account and clicking on “Contact Info” at the top of the page. At any time, Registrants can modify their Team Sharing settings such that no additional Personal Information (with the exception of first and last name) will be shared with Team Members.

**  
User Data Supplementation**

SportsSignup provides a service, called [ **KidSafe** _Plus_ ®](https://web.archive.org/background-checks), to help manage the background check process for individuals designated by our Customer.  While it is understandable that consumers are reluctant to disclose their Social Security Number, it is a crucial piece of information to help ensure the name being provided will match potential criminal records, to acquire a list of possible aliases used, and to provide additional information reduce the number of false positives resulting from “common name” matches.  Social Security numbers are captured as part of a Registrant’s profile, and passed on to our background check partner (via secure communications), who performs the background check. The specific background check provider used is fully disclosed during the background check registration process. The Social Security numbers are deleted from the SportsSignup system once the results are returned (often minutes after the user supplies the information).

**  
Testimonials**

We post customer testimonials on our website, which may contain personal information such as the customer's name.  We do obtain the customer's consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at [privacy@sportssignup.com](mailto:privacy@sportssignup.com).

**  
Mailing Lists**

E-mailing Registrants is the primary method by which Customers communicate with Registrants - and a vital component of the SportsSignup system. Therefore, Registrants can expect to receive periodic e-mails from the Customer regarding sign-up deadlines, meeting notices, and other timely notifications.

E-mail information collected is not shared with any other party, unless authorization is granted and explicitly defined in SportsSignup’s Service Agreement with Customer. Registrants are advised to check with their organization regarding the use and privacy of Personal Information collected on behalf of the Customer.
