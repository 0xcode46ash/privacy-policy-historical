# TeamSnap : Privacy Policy

## TEAMSNAP

### Privacy Policy

#### Overview

We take privacy very seriously, mainly because we don't like people messing with ours. We hate it when companies take advantage of the trust that is placed in them, and so we vow to treat all your information with the utmost care and respect.

When you communicate with us or use the TeamSnap system, we will know your email address. When you sign up for TeamSnap, we will ask you for information such as your name, team name, billing address, and credit card information. (Sometimes, if we're feeling frisky, we might ask you for your horoscope sign.) But we don't share that information with anybody else for any reason. Period.

The only exception to this might be if we're required to share your information with law enforcement. Or maybe if there was some cataclysmic global event like an asteroid strike and we thought it might help. But short of that, your information is 100% confidential. In fact, we'd be inclined to lay down our lives to protect your information (or at least just lay down, like for a nap).

However, if you violate our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/web/20100222175211id_/http%3A//teamsnap.com/terms.php), all bets are off and we might send your information to crazy Russian spammers.

#### Cookies

A cookie is a small sweet cake, typically round, flat, and crisp. We love cookies, especially when they have both peanut butter and chocolate in them. And snickerdoodles are good too.

We eat these kinds of cookies, often with milk. Mmm...

A cookie is also a packet of data sent by an Internet server to a browser, which is returned by the browser each time it subsequently accesses the same server, used to identify the user or track their access to the server.

We use these kinds of cookies on the TeamSnap service, mainly to keep track of your current session information. But we don't use permanent cookies because we like to clean up after ourselves.

#### Data Storage

We own all the data storage, databases, code and other assets that make the TeamSnap service function. But you retain all the rights to the information you store within TeamSnap and we'll never share that information with anybody else for any reason. Besides, who would want to know your batting average?

During the process of developing and troubleshooting the TeamSnap service, it may be necessary to look at pieces of your data to improve the service or resolve a problem. But, as we've stated here, your data is never shared with any outside entity for any reason.

#### Changes

If there is a change to our privacy policy for any reason, we will notify you promptly by sending an email to the email address we have on file for you. We considered sending changes via a little rolled up note attached to the leg of a carrier pigeon, but that has proven too costly.

#### Questions?

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, just send an email to [howdy@teamsnap.com](mailto:howdy@teamsnap.com). Or if for some reason you want to send us a letter (do people still do that?) just address it to TeamSnap, 1228 Mallard Court, Boulder Colorado 80303, USA.
