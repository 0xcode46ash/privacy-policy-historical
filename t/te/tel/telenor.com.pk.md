**What is spamming via SMS/MMS?**

SMS/MMS is a very useful means for persons/companies who wish to send information on their products/services quickly. Unfortunately it is also improperly used by some who send mass advertisements to people with whom they have no contractual relationship.

Spamming is the unsolicited dissemination of mass advertising/information via telecommunications. When mobile owners receive such SMS/MMS messages, it must be assumed that these messages are sent systematically via the internet to entire blocks of numbers.

**What responsibility does Telenor bear?** **  
**  
Telenor is responsible for transporting information across its network and cannot monitor messages sent by private individuals or companies. Telenor only ensures that these messages are transported without being aware of their contents. Telenor cannot filter the SMS/MMS received by its customers because this would mean checking the content of the messages, therefore violating the confidentiality of telecommunications.

Telecommunication companies are not in a position to monitor and prohibit the transmission of unsolicited messages because they cannot know if a commercial relationship exists between the sender and the recipient of the advertising message. They are only aware of spamming after complaints are received from customers, whose responsibility it is first and foremost to take action against the spammers. Depending on where the spam has come from and following unsuccessful interventions by customers against spammers, the companies can then intervene with the spammer to demand that they stop this practice, and if the offence is repeated, the spammer can be prohibited access to the network. Unfortunately this is not possible in every case.

**How can You protect yourself against spamming**

There are some basic rules you can apply in order to reduce as much as possible the risk of being bothered by unsolicited SMS/MMS. You handle your mobile phone number with care and do not give it out over the internet, in forums or other lists or competitions. Many forms often contain in the small print a statement such as 'I am interested in receiving information/advertisements for other products...', which effectively authorizes the sending of commercial SMS/MMS message(s).

**What can You do if spamming continues?** **  
**  
Please contact Customer Care in writing, including all the details of the SMS/MMS message(s) including the number of origin of message, content of the message, date and time of receipt etc. Unfortunately, Telenor cannot guarantee that you will not receive messages of this sort in future, since anyone who has access to the mobile network can send advertising SMS/MMS messages without Telenor being able to monitor this.

**What can We do if spamming continues**

Telenor will do what it can to intervene with the sender of the messages. We will do all we can to identify the origin of the message and to demand the sender to stop sending such messages. In some cases we can cut off access to the mobile network for the sender of unsolicited messages. Unfortunately the legal situation as regards spamming is not clear: it is not considered illegal. Telenor supports the GSMAâS Spam Code of Practice in the fight against spam.

**Customers Beware**

Please be aware that some Telenor Pakistan customers are receiving hoax calls and fraudulent SMS informing them that they have won a valuable prize. To get the prize, customers are told to buy some scratch cards and tell the calling party the numbers on them. The fraudulent party immediately transfers the balance to unknown accounts thus depriving the customers of their money.

Please also be aware that in some instances, Telenor Pakistan customers are receiving hoax calls and fraudulent SMS asking them to reply. The SMS contains a hidden message which transfers prepaid balance from the customer's account on reply.

PLEASE NOTE THAT SUCH CALLS AND SMS ARE A FRAUD.

This notice is being given in the public-interest to inform our customers from fraudulent practices. However Telenor Pakistan does not hold any responsibility or is in any way liable for compensation what so ever against such fraudulent activities.
