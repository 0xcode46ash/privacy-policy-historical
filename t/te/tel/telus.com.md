# TELUS Privacy Policy Statement

BCT.TELUS has made consumer privacy a high priority. We have a long-standing policy of protecting the privacy of customers in all of our business operations. BCT.TELUS has the responsibility to protect the confidentiality of the content of any information transmitted over the network and to safeguard the use of information that customers may reasonably expect us to keep private. BCT.TELUS adopts the Canadian Standards Association privacy standard, _Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information_ CAN/CSA-Q830-96 (CSA Standard). The CSA Standard is a voluntary code for ensuring the protection of consumer privacy and is a world-respected cornerstone for addressing privacy issues. The point of origin for the CSA privacy code is the OECD's _Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data,_ adopted by the Government of Canada in 1984. 

When you provide your personal information to BCT.TELUS, we will maintain the confidentiality of your personal information and it will be used only to support your customer relationship with BCT.TELUS. In protecting your privacy rights, BCT.TELUS:
