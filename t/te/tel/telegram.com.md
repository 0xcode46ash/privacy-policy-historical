# telegram.com - Info Center

This policy describes how the web sites maintained by the Telegram & Gazette - telegram.com, eworcester.com and worcesterlivingmagazine.com and others as they become available - collect and utilize users' personal identifiable information.

The web sites will not disclose a user's personal identifiable information to a third party without the user's express permission.

**Information we don't gather**

Users can access our web sites and use many of our services without providing any personal information. We don't follow a user's browsing path outside our web sites.

We do develop summary reports of usage for our advertisers. This includes the numbers of times pages or advertisements are viewed. This information is used to determine the effectiveness of advertising strategies. We don't tell our advertisers the identity of individual users who saw or clicked on their advertisements.

**Information we do gather**

Certain services require registration. We do not share this information with third parties without disclosing that intention.

We have partnered with TACODA Audience Networks which uses general information about the types of sites you visit and other non-personally identifiable information about you in order to deliver advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you wish to opt out of this and other targeted adverstising networks, you can use the [Network Advertising Initiave Opt-out Tool](http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

**Usage tracking**

We track usage patterns on our web sites, breaking down overall statistics according to a user's browser type, domain name and time of day. We do not match these statistics with a user's personal identifiable information. This information , for example, helps to determine if a majority of our users are employing a recent enough browser version to support certain forms of coding.

**"Email this story to a friend"**

Users can forward a news story to someone else by clicking the link at the bottom of a story. The user must provide his email address to tell the recipient who sent the story. Users can also choose to include a message. None of this information is used for any other purpose.

**Contests**

T&G Online often offers contests in which participants must register. Required information always includes at least name and email address. Sometimes more information is required. The rules and terms of each contest can vary. Contests are often run in partnership with advertisers or businesses and registration information may be shared with those parties.

**Subscribing to the paper, buying a photo and/or placing a classified ad**

Personal information is required to complete any of these transactions. The information is maintained in databases offline by the individual departments.
