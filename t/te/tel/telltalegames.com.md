**Third Party Links**

To provide relevant information not found on our Sites, Telltale may provide links from our Sites to third party websites. We encourage our users to read third party websites' privacy policies before submitting personal information.

**Correspondence With Telltale**

If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on our Sites, we may collect such information into a file which is only accessed by authorized personnel. We may also collect other users' comments about you in our complaints department. 

**Tracking Information of our Users**

In the course of using our Sites, we automatically track certain information such as your IP addresses and email addresses. We may tie your IP address to your personally identifiable information. We automatically track information through the use of a “cookie.” A “cookie” is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Telltale uses cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information through the Sites. Some of our business partners use cookies on our Sites (for example, advertisers). We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for third parties set cookies for advertising.

Information we collect through cookies and other information from our log files about your activity on the Sites is used to help resolve technical problems or issues and may also assist in making your visit more enjoyable (for example, using a cookie will allow you to use certain features on our Sites without having to log in each time you visit). 

Telltale also collects IP addresses (an IP address is the string of numbers that identifies each sender or receiver of information that is sent across the Internet), for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information internally and to some of our business partners and advertisers and to audit the use of our Sites. When visitors request pages on one of our Sites, our servers log the visitors' IP addresses. We collect log files that record activity on our Sites and gather statistics about visitor’s time and activity on the Sites. The statistics are generated anonymously, and they help us in connection with marketing and demographic studies as we enhance our Sites. Telltale does not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. Telltale can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use, to protect our services, Sites or a person or entity. 

If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will post a notice prominently on our Sites. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In some cases where we post the notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. 

**Your use of Other Users' Information**

You may not use other users' information for commercial purposes, to spam, to harass, or to make unlawful threats. Telltale reserves the right to terminate those who misuse other users' information or who otherwise violate the Telltale Terms of Use. 

**Control of Your Password**

You may not disclose your password to any third parties or share it with any third parties. If, despite the foregoing, you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password. 

**Reviewing, Changing or Deleting Your Personally Identifiable Information**
