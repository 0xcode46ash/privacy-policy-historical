# Privacy | Orion Telescopes & Binoculars

## Privacy Policy

Welcome to the Orion Telescopes & Binoculars website, Telescope.com (the "Site"). Orion Telescopes & Binoculars has created this Privacy Policy in order to set forth the principles governing our information-gathering and dissemination practices in connection with the Site, including but not limited to such activities as the offering for sale of services and merchandise, as well as forums, chat rooms, personal profile pages, product reviews, article commentary, blogs, RSS feeds, newsletters and eCommerce, among other offerings (the "Web Site Activities"). Orion Telescopes & Binoculars has a strong commitment to the privacy of our Site's users. Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through the Site and not to information collected offline or to information you may provide to any third-party sites to which our Site may link, except as expressly provided herein.

## Information We Collect

There are two kinds of information that Web sites can obtain about you: "Anonymous Information" and "Personally Identifiable Information."

"Anonymous Information" consists of non-personally-identifiable data, such as your Internet Protocol ("IP") address or domain, or information about your usage of our Site that is used for administrative purposes only. For example, an IP address is a unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We may collect our users' IP addresses for such purposes as to help diagnose problems with our servers and to report aggregate information to our advertisers, corporate affiliates and consultants, and to third parties that perform particular services on our behalf. We may also collect IP addresses as a security precaution when customers initiate orders through our Site, because although IP addresses themselves are non-personally identifiable, they are linked to information about you that is personally identifiable.

We may also use the information linked to IP addresses to ban users who violate our Terms and Conditions of use.

"Personally Identifiable Information" is any information that personally identifies you, such as your name, street address, email address, telephone number or credit card number. We collect such information when, for example, you enter a contest, subscribe to our email newsletter, participate in other interactive online activities such as forums, or order merchandise through our Site.

NOTE: DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CREDIT CARD INFORMATION IN ANY EMAIL COMMUNICATION. IF YOU DO, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT YOUR INFORMATION WILL REMAIN SECURE, AND WE THEREFORE WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSSES THAT YOU MAY SUFFER AS A RESULT.

Any and all of your Personally Identifiable Information (with the exception of your credit card information, which is always kept confidential) may be used to help us maintain your account, and also to enable us and our business partners to send you announcements of new Site features, special offers and promotional material. However, if you decide that you do not wish to receive future email communications from Orion Telescopes & Binoculars, you may follow the "Unsubscribe" instructions on the communication you have received.

If you purchase a product through our Site, your email address will be used to send your order and shipping confirmations, as well as other relevant correspondence regarding your order. We may also collect your email address if you order a product catalog. We may subsequently send you emails related to our products or services. If you do not want to receive product-related emails from us, you may follow the "Unsubscribe" instructions on the communication you have received or contact us as follows:

> **Orion Telescopes & Binoculars**: [sales@telescope.com](mailto:sales@telescope.com) or 800-676-1343

If you supply us with your postal address, you may receive catalogs or mailings from us with information on products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please contact us as follows:

> **Orion Telescopes & Binoculars**: [sales@telescope.com](mailto:sales@telescope.com) or 800-676-1343

Also, as a customer of our Site, you may receive postal mailings from other reputable companies. You can have your name put on our "do-not-share" list by contacting us as follows:

> **Orion Telescopes & Binoculars**: [sales@telescope.com](mailto:sales@telescope.com) or 800-676-1343

Whenever you contact us in this fashion, please provide us with your exact name and address. We will make sure that you are removed from the postal address list we occasionally share with other organizations. 

If you are a customer of our Site, you may change your email information or your postal address information by sending an email to us as follows:

> **Orion Telescopes & Binoculars**: [sales@telescope.com](mailto:sales@telescope.com) or 800-676-1343

We may attempt to verify your order with the preCharge global merchant network. preCharge does not approve or decline orders, however does provide a review system based on a variety of information provided in the ordering processing by which we may use to consider your order.

FOR YOUR OWN PROTECTION, NEVER SEND CREDIT CARD INFORMATION VIA EMAIL. WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF EMAIL TRANSMISSIONS AND THUS CANNOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSSES THAT YOU MAY SUFFER AS A RESULT.

In all cases, we will only use your information as permitted by law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Privacy Policy, however, we may disclose Personally Identifiable Information to others if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law or with legal process; (b) protect and defend our rights and property; (c) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site; or (d) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public. Please note that we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.

## Use of "Cookies"

Our Site uses "cookies" — data that is transferred from our Site to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes — to keep track of your shopping cart when you order merchandise through our Site. We also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our Site.

We work with Google to display advertisements to our site prospects, on our behalf, across the Internet. Google uses cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to our website. You may opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the [Google advertising opt-out page](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

## Disclosure of Information through Business Transfers

As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses, and in so doing, acquire customer information. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. Similarly, in the event that a portion or substantially all of Orion Telescopes & Binoculars' assets are sold or transferred to a third party, customer information (including your email address) would likely be one of the transferred business assets.

## Third Party Web Sites

The Site contains links to third-party Web sites not owned or controlled by Orion Telescopes & Binoculars. Orion Telescopes & Binoculars is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third-party Web sites. Inclusion of any linked Web site on our Site does not imply or express an approval or endorsement of the linked Web site by us, or of any of the content, opinions, products or services provided on these Web sites. Even if an affiliation exists between Orion Telescopes & Binoculars and a third-party Web site, we exercise no control over linked sites. Each of these linked sites maintains its own independent privacy and data collection policies and procedures. If you visit a Web site via a link from our Site, we encourage you to consult that Web site's privacy policy before providing any personal information, and whenever interacting with any such Web site.

## Public Forums

Our Site may make chat rooms, forums, blogs, article commenting, and personal profile pages available to users. Please remember that any such information that you may choose to provide in these areas becomes accessible to the public, and also becomes the property of Orion Telescopes & Binoculars in accordance with our [Terms and Conditions](http://www.telescope.com/content.jsp?pageName=TermsAndConditions), and we may use such information in any way that we see fit. Consequently, you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information or to upload material of any kind onto our Site.

## Security

Our Site has reasonable security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Security of information communicated by or to us over the Internet is of utmost concern to us; however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that your email, like most, if not all, non-encrypted Internet communications, may potentially be accessed and viewed by other Internet users, without your knowledge and permission, while in transit to us. For that reason, to protect your privacy, please do not use email to communicate information to us that you consider confidential. While we strive to protect your personal information, Orion Telescopes & Binoculars cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or through this our Site. Once we receive your transmission, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our internal systems. Depending on the nature of the inquiry, your communication may be discarded or archived.

## Web site security

We have taken many steps to ensure the security of your transaction. Telescope.com is secured with a GeoTrust world-class SSL certificate, enabling up to 256-bit SSL encryption. More than 100,000 customers in over 150 countries trust GeoTrust to secure online transactions and conduct business over the Internet. The presence of SSL means you can rest assured that communications (e.g. credit card numbers) between your browser and this site's web servers are private and secure when the SSL session is activated.

This Site is tested and certified daily to pass the McAfee Secure Security Scan. To help address concerns about hacker access to confidential data, the "live" McAfee Secure mark appears only when a web site meets the McAfee Secure standard. This indicates that a site such as ours meets payment card industry guidelines for remote web server vulnerability testing to help protect your personal information. Click here to confirm.

## Policy Regarding Minors

Children should always ask parents before providing any personal information online. No information should be submitted to or posted on any Site by any minor (a person under 18 years of age) without the consent of a parent or guardian. Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, we do not knowingly provide any Personally Identifiable Information about minors, regardless of its source, nor is this information knowingly used by Orion Telescopes & Binoculars for any marketing or promotional purposes. Minors are not eligible to participate in contests on the Sites, unless expressly provided to the contrary.
