**Privacy Policy**

**When you browse our site**  
For each visitor to our Web site, our Web server records only the consumer's domain name, but not the e-mail address. We also collect aggregate information on what pages consumers visit. This information is used to improve the content of our Web site. Shopping cart contents are anonymous until an actual order is placed.

**Your E-mail address**  
We collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, place catalog requests, or place orders via our website, or who provide us with e-mail addresses in any other communications.

We do not sell, rent, or loan customer e-mail addresses to any other party.

Your e-mail address will be used to send your order and shipping confirmations, and for relevant correspondence regarding your order. We may also send you occasional e-mail notices relating to our products or services. If you do not want to receive e-mail from us in the future, please let us know by sending e-mail to us at sales@telescope.com or by calling us at 800-447-1001.

**Your postal address**  
If you supply us with your postal address you may receive occasional catalogs or mailings from us with information on products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please let us know by sending e-mail to us at sales@telescope.com or by calling us at 800-447-1001.

Also, you may receive occasional mailings from other reputable companies. You can have your name put on our "do-not-share" list by sending e-mail to us at sales@telescope.com or by calling us at 800-447-1001. Please provide us with your exact name and address. We will be sure your name is removed from the list we share with other organizations.

You may change your e-mail information or your postal address information by sending e-mail to us at sales@telescope.com or by calling us at 800-447-1001.

**Cookies - what they are and how we use them**  
Cookies are small bits of text that your Web browser software stores on your computer when you visit some web sites. Orion may use cookies to help make it easier for you to use our site.

For example, we may use a cookie to retrieve your Orion shopping cart contents on a return visit. This cookie contains absolutely no personal information about you. The cookie file is merely a text file, and the cookie we may add is nothing but a line of text.

**Web site security**  
We have taken many steps to ensure the security of your transaction. The data you send is strongly encrypted, using SSL, the industry standard security protocol that Orion uses to communicate with secure browsers like Netscape and Internet Explorer. You can confirm that you are in a secure area by looking for the closed padlock symbol on your browser.

We guarantee that it is 100% safe to shop on our website.
