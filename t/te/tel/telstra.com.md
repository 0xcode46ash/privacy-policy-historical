These activities are conducted at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security.

We ask that children under the age of 16 have a parent or guardian verify their membership application with telstra.com. Whilst telstra.com will make every reasonable effort to ensure that children's privacy and other rights are not compromised, it is ultimately the responsibility of parents to monitor their children's Internet usage. 

Children should always ask a parent before sending any transmission over the Internet. 

**What else you should know about privacy**
