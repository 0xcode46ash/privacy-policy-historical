Online Privacy Policy  
  
**Tele Atlas NV, Website Privacy Policy**

Tele Atlas NV and its subsidiaries, respect your privacy. To demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices, we have adopted industry leading privacy guidelines.

When using our website ("Site"), you may provide us information such as your email address, name, title and mailing address so that we can provide enhanced products or services to you and to personalize your experience on our website. This online privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") describes how we use and protect information that you share with us. This policy governs our Site, but does not govern web-sites to which we may provide links, because we are not responsible, and can not control the privacy practices or content of those sites. We urge you at all times to use caution when providing information over the Internet, and suggest that you read the Federal Trade Commission’s suggested safety precautions for Internet surfing.

  * **Types of Information Collected**  
a. Internet Data Collected. We automatically track and collect the following information when you visit our Site: (i) your domain name; and (ii) the web pages on our Site that you view or visit (collectively "Internet Data").

Internet Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you but is helpful for marketing purposes and for improving your experience on the Site. We may also use "cookies " or other tracking means to ensure that you do not see temporary content (e.g. Flash content or banner notices) repeatedly and to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Site. These "cookies" are designed to lapse when your visit to our site ends or your web browser is closed.

b. Individual Identifying Information Collected. In order for you to purchase products that we offer via the Site, we require you to provide us with information that personally identifies you to enable us to complete the transaction ("Identifying Information"). Identifying Information may include Contact Data (such as your name, title, company, mailing and e-mail addresses) and Financial Data (such as your account or credit card number).

If you communicate with us by e-mail or complete online forms, surveys, sweepstakes, or contest entries, any information provided in such communication may be collected as Identifying Information. You are not required to complete surveys, promotions, or otherwise provide Identifying Information to view web pages of our Site.

  * **Uses of Information Collected**  
We may use Contact Data to email, mail, or call you via telephone to provide you with information about our company or our products or services.

We will send Identifying Information about you to other companies or people when: (a) We have your consent to share the information; (b) We need to share the information in order to provide the product or service you have requested; (c) We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of us to provide a product or service to you (unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the Identifying Information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us); (d) We respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; or (e) We find your actions on our Site violate any of our agreements with you.
  * **User Choice Regarding Collection, Use and Distribution of Identifying Information**  
You may choose not to provide us with any Identifying Information. In such an event, you can still access and use much of the Site; however you will not be able to access and use those portions of the Site that require your Identifying Information.

  * **Confidentiality and Security of Identifying Information**  
We will keep your Identifying Information private unless such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with a court order or other legal process; (b) protect our rights or property; or (c) enforce any agreement between us and you.

In order to ensure that all of your Identifying Information is correct and up-to-date, at any time you may e-mail us at [webmaster@teleatlas.com](mailto:webmaster@teleatlas.com) and request your Identifying Information. Please include your User name and Password in any request for your Identifying Information. You may then: (a) review and update your Identifying Information that we have already collected; (b) choose whether or not you wish us to send you information about our company, or promotional material from some of our resellers or partners; or (c) choose whether or not you wish us to share some of your Identifying Information with third parties.
