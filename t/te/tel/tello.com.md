# Tello US | Privacy Policy & Statement | You are safe with us

## Tello Privacy Policy 

Effective Date: December 16, 2016

This privacy policy describes how Tello collects and uses the personal information you provide on our web site: tello.com, owned and operated by KeepCalling. 

At Tello we care about the privacy of our visitors and we are committed to protecting your private data at all times. This privacy policy describes how Tello collects and uses the personal information you provide on our web site: tello.com. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.

We will not collect any of your personal information that you do not volunteer to make available or consent to for further action. We do not sell, share, or rent this personal information to others in any way that we have not mentioned in this statement.

If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at customerservice@tello.com. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at [https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.](https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request)

## Collection of Information

We collect personally identifiable information, like names, postal addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, credit card number, etc, when voluntarily submitted by our visitors. This information is used only to fulfill your specific request or process your order, unless you give us permission to use it in another manner, for example to add you to one of our contact lists.

Once registered with Tello, you authorize us to use the information you provide to customize your interaction with our website. If you choose to sign up or log in to Tello using a social media account (Facebook, Google, etc), Tello will have access to the name and email address you registered in your social media account. Even if you remove the social media account you connected with from your Tello account, your name and email address will not be removed from your Tello account. 

## Security

We use reasonable precautions to keep the personal information you disclose both in your browsing and your purchases and to never release this information to third parties. Your personally identifiable information is kept secure. Only authorized employees have access to this information. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at customerservice@tello.com. 

If you make an order on this website, we will need to use, but not store, certain of the information provided by you in order to process your order. This will include details related to your payment. We do not store private transaction details such as credit card information.

We may use some data collected to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities and violations of our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/terms).

## Offers and Promotions

We will use the data you provide us to notify you of offers or products that may be of interest to you, but at no time will we provide your data to third parties for their own direct marketing activities.  
If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, you may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, accessing the email preferences in your account settings page or you can contact us at customerservice@tello.com.

## Analytics/Log Files

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track usersâ€™ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information, for example IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information in the remote situations of fraud investigation. 

## Behavioral Targeting/Re-Targeting

We partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partners use cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

## User Access and Choice

Upon request Tello will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. You may access, correct, or request deletion of your personal information by making the change on our member information page or by emailing our Customer Service at customerservice@tello.com. We will respond to your request to access within a reasonable timeframe.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

## Cookies

Like many other websites, Tello uses cookies to identify members and gather information related to the number of visitors and understanding how visitors use the website. Cookies can also help customize the website for our visitors and improve your experience by displaying goods and services that might interest you. You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, [Ads Preferences Manager](https://www.google.com/ads/preferences/) or [Consumer Opt-Out](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) tool. However, this can affect your interaction with our website, as well as other websites.

Our partners, affiliates and service providers use cookies in order to make it easier for you to navigate our site. The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates and company service providers is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

## Third Parties

Also, in our efforts to match our products with the people interested in them, we use advertising services belonging to third party vendors, such as Google. Your visit on our website is likely to be a result of this third party service provided to us (AdWords, DoubleClick, etc), as well as a source to be exposed to future ads based on your past visits and interests. To opt out the use of cookies you should visit the [Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). 

Our presence across the Internet is the outcome of this matching of users' preference and products available. In order to reach the right audience, the external companies we collaborate with (like Google or Quantcast) may use certain information to establish consumers' habits: visits to a website, goods and services to determine or predict our visitors' characteristics, behavior, or preferences.

Anonymous data collected from visits to our websites is matched by external companies to larger pools of data (from more websites) to deliver ads to people with similar browsing pattern to our visitors. Thus, consumers receive more relevant ads and advertisers benefit from more effective advertising.  
Such data collected DOES NOT INCLUDE our visitor's name, address, email address, telephone number. More information on how Google stores such data in the user's browser (using a "cookie") can be found [here](http://support.google.com/ads/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2662749).

Our Site includes links to other web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Tello. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any Web site you visit.

Our web site also includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. Tello will never share with third parties aggregate statistics about our customers, traffic patterns, and related site information. Tello may use third party companies to provide delivery of email newsletters and other messages over email. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this Policy regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with our Clients.

We may also disclose your personal information:

  * in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements;
  * as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;
  * when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud;
  * if Tello is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information;
  * to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.
