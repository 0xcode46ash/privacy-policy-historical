## Our commitment to your privacy

Urban Airship, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Urban Airship”), respects your individual privacy. Our privacy policy documents our adherence to industry standards for the protection of your personal information.

### Scope of the Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy covers Urban Airship’s treatment of personally identifiable information that may be collected while you are on the Urban Airship site, when you order its products or that is shared with Urban Airship by its business partners. This policy does not apply to (i) Urban Airship’s treatment of personally identifiable information that may be collected while you use Urban Airship’s products or services, which such treatment shall be subject to and governed solely by the terms of Urban Airship’s then-current Service Agreement, available at [www.urbanairship.com/legal](http://www.urbanairship.com/legal/), or (ii) the practices of companies not owned or controlled by Urban Airship or to people whom Urban Airship does not employ or manage, nor does it address non-personally identifiable information. The policy specifically addresses the following areas:

  * What personally identifiable information is collected by Urban Airship or by any third party through our site; 
  * How Urban Airship uses this information;
  * With whom Urban Airship may share this information;
  * What choices are available to you as a user of the site with respect to collection, use and distribution of the information; 
  * What types of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control; and 
  * How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.



### Information Collection and Use

Urban Airship is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. Urban Airship may collect information from you at two different stages. First, we collect anonymous, aggregate information from all visitors to the site. This information is never linked to any personally identifiable information and is only used in the aggregate to generate statistical reports about the use of our site. Second, Urban Airship collects personally identifiable information when you create a Urban Airship account and when you order Urban Airship products or utilize certain services. Online account creation may require you to submit the following personal information: name, address, company information, email address, and phone number. For purposes of billing, you may need to provide your credit card type, number, expiration date and billing address for the card. Certain personally identifiable information is required if you subscribe to a Urban Airship newsletter, or sign up to participate in a promotion, sweepstake or survey through the site. Urban Airship may also receive personally identifiable information from our business partners.

### Personal Information of Children Under 13

Urban Airship complies with the requirements of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the FTC’s Rule interpreting COPPA (16 CFR § 512). This site is not directed to children and does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information form children under 13 years of age.

### Your Disclosures to Third Parties

To the extent you include personal data in your submissions (such as your email address, phone number or photo of yourself), third parties may be able to identify you, associate you with your user account, and contact you. Please do not include information in your submissions that you expect to keep private. In addition, you can reduce the risk of being personally identified by choosing a fictitious account name, though doing so could detract from the credibility of your submissions. Please also note that the personal messages you send or receive using any website personal messaging feature, if available, are only private to the extent that you and the sender/recipient keep them private. For example, we do not have any control over whether a recipient of one of your personal messages publicly posts the contents of such a message.

### Use of Your Personal Information

Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient and customized experience while using our site and to allow us to provide products and services to you. Urban Airship will never give your information to, or share your information with, any third party not affiliated with or owned by Urban Airship, except as permitted by law. Urban Airship will send personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people when:

  * We have your consent to share the information;
  * We need to share your information to provide the products or services you have requested;
  * We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Urban Airship to provide a product or service to you. (Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us); or 
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process or find that your actions on our web site violate the Urban Airship Terms of Use or any of our usage guidelines for specific products or services.

### Business Transitions

In the event that Urban Airship goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, our customers’ personal information may be part of the assets transferred. Customers will be notified via prominent notice on our site prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information.

### Security

Wherever your personal information may be held within Urban Airship or on its behalf, we intend to take commercially reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the personal information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, given the nature of the Internet and the fact that network security measures are not infallible, we cannot guarantee the security of your information. We use encryption to protect sensitive information online. The servers that store your personally identifiable information are housed in a secure environment. Finally, we also make an effort to protect your information off-line.  
When registering for access to a secure area of the site, we may ask you to select a username and password. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also, remember to sign out of the registered site and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence when accessing your computer.
