## What personal data do we collect?

Personal data is information that identifies you as an individual. TeleTech collects certain types of personal data at [http://www.teletech.com](http://www.teletech.com/) (our "website") and offline in connection with the services we provide. 

We collect personal data from you, such as your name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number or other payment account number, only when you voluntarily provide it to us. In order for you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided by us (for example, to subscribe to our newsletter, request information from us), we may require that you furnish personal data.

## Your privacy on TeleTech’s websites

The primary purpose of TeleTech’s website is to be a dynamic resource and business tool to help you learn more about TeleTech. We want you to feel secure when visiting our website and are committed to maintaining your privacy when doing so.

## What information do we gather?

TeleTech collects information at its website in two ways: (1) directly (for example, when you provide information to sign up for a newsletter or register to comment on a forum website); and (2) indirectly (for example, through our website's technology).

We may collect and process the following information:

  * Information that you provide by filling in forms on our website. This includes subscribing to services, newsletters and alerts. Pages that collect this type of information may provide further information as to why your data is needed and how it will be used. It is completely up to you whether you want to provide it.
  * If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.
  * We may ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them.
  * Any postings, comments or other content that you upload or post to TeleTech’s website.
  * Our website collects information about your computer, including (where available) your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration, to filter traffic, to look up user domains and to report on statistics.
  * Details of your visits to our website, the pages you view and resources you access or download, including but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data. Please see the Cookies section below for more information.



When this information relates to or identifies you, we will treat it as “personal data.”

## How do we use information that we collect from the site?

We use personal data to provide you with information you request, process online job applications, and for other purposes which we would describe to you at the point where it is collected or which will be obvious to you. For example:

  * To fulfill your requests articles, newsletters or other content. 
  * For surveys or research questionnaires. 
  * To personalize your experience at our website.
  * To contact you for marketing purposes where you have agreed to this. 



We analyze your IP and browser information to determine what is most effective about our website, to help us identify ways to improve it and make it more effective. 

## What about "Cookies"?

The term "cookie" refers to files that are transferred from a website to your computer's hard drive. The purpose of cookies is to enable us to track your activities on our website. Cookies help us remember who you are. They work in the same fashion as the clerk in a store you visit on a regular basis. The store clerk may not necessarily know your name, but he or she recognizes that you have been in the store before and may remember what you usually purchase while you are in the store. Cookies permit us to gain the same kind of information about you and enable us to provide you with more efficient and personalized service. For example, for sites that require registration, a cookie file can be stored on your computer enabling you to skip the registration process on subsequent visits. Cookies are also frequently used to track the progression of a customer engaged in an online purchase to make sure that the transactional information remains intact.

Some (usually newer) versions of Web browsers allow you to decide whether or not to accept cookie files and some programs notify you when a website is about to deposit a cookie file on your hard drive. If you decide not to accept cookies, you may not be able to successfully navigate some portions of a website.

TeleTech uses cookie files for the customized presentation of Web pages. We do not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in the cookie, nor do we use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, except as expressly set forth in this privacy statement.

## Will we share your personal data with outside parties?

TeleTech may store, use, and disclose personal information as authorized or required by applicable law, including making disclosures that are necessary or advisable to: (1) protect the rights, health, safety, or property of TeleTech or others; (2) to perform analysis that we may use to improve our website or services; (3) allow for lawful security related investigations or law enforcement investigations; and (4) comply with applicable laws, regulations, or other lawful requirements.

Except as stated above, TeleTech will not transfer, exchange, license, sell, lease, or otherwise disclose your personal information without your approval; however, TeleTech may collect and/or provide aggregate statistics about TeleTech’s website and website visitors to other parties. We will not sell personal data to third parties. We may transfer personal data to our contracted service providers and advisors who may be located in other countries.
