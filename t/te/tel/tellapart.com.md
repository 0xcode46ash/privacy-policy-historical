**Overview of TellApart’s Technology and Data Collection**

Our Technology collects information about the website(s) that you visit and the advertisements that you see while online. We may collect data about you using our Technology in the following contexts: when TellApart or one of our Business Partners purchase online advertisements on a website that you visit (“Advertising Data”); and/or when one of our Business Partners uses our Technology on its website, which you visit (“Business Partner Data”). The type of Advertising Data we collect includes the number of advertisement requests received, the number of advertisements you are shown, the identity of the website you are visiting and the number of clicks you may make on a particular advertisement, but in all cases Advertising Data is Non-PII. The type of Business Partner Data we collect includes information regarding the pages and products you have viewed, the identity of products purchased, the time you spend on particular web pages and product price. Business Partner Data may in some cases include PII. However, we do not associate this information with the information that is separately gathered off the Business Partners’ websites through our online advertising activities.

We use the information collected by our Technology in order to help make the TellApart Ads you see more relevant to you, to improve our Technology, and for ad delivery purposes. We also may disclose Non-PII to our Business Partners in connection with the provision of TellApart Technology services.

**Cookies, JavaScript and Web Beacons** ****

****TellApart uses cookies, JavaScript and web beacons in connection with our Technology and our collection of both Advertising Data and Business Partner Data. These types of technologies help TellApart better understand the effectiveness of a TellApart Ad (for example, by tracking the way in which you may respond to, select and interact with a TellApart Ad or any content provided therein, or the location and context in which you view a TellApart Ad). TellApart’s cookies also help control the number of times you view a TellApart Ad. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to enjoy the full functionality of many of the websites you visit.

TellApart also uses JavaScript and web beacons, in combination with cookies, to analyze usage patterns. The use of these technologies allows TellApart to record that someone has visited a particular webpage, along with additional Non-PII that the website may choose to include with the beacon.

**Information Received from Other Third Parties**

****In some cases, we may choose to work with third party data providers to support requirements that may arise from our Business Partners. For example, our business partners may use our technology to combine anonymous third party data with the data collected by our technology in order to further tailor advertising content to their customers. In conjunction with information collected using our Technology, we use this information in order to help make the TellApart Ads you see more relevant to you, to improve our Technology, and for ad delivery and reporting purposes.
