### What about personal information you post on this Site or give to other Users or Retailers?

We do not take responsibility for any personal information or other details that you post on this Site, such as reviews, comments, images, ratings or discussions (including through posting content within a Retailer's Webstore or notice board that contains your personal information). This becomes public information by its nature. You acknowledge that if you post content or provide information on this Site then such content and information will be accessible to the general public, including persons who are not signed in to use this Site and the public will be able to associate and attribute such content or information to you. Similarly, we do not take responsibility for any personal information provided directly to other Users or Retailers. You should not post or share personal information on this Site that you do not want made publicly available, and you are solely responsible for the personal information that you post or share on this Site or provide directly to third parties. You should not post other people's personal information on this Site (including, for example, images of other people) without their consent.

### What do we do with the information?

We will only use or disclose your personal information for the purposes for which you have provided it to us, and as set out in this Privacy Policy, unless you have consented to the use or disclosure of your personal information for another purpose or it is necessary to use or disclose your personal information to comply with laws or regulations applicable to us from time to time.

We use your personal information to deliver our services to you (and to enable third parties such as Retailers and service providers to deliver their services to you, including order fulfilment and after-sales services). To properly operate and administer this Site, we need to provide your personal information to our staff, group companies, Retailers and service providers. Our staff, group companies, Retailers and service providers are subject to obligations of confidentiality to us. By providing your consent to this Privacy Policy you authorise them to gain access to your personal information as part of their services to you and us.

We also use your personal information to keep you up to date with events and products that may be of interest to you (which may include displaying to you personalised content and advertising and information about goods and services that may be of interest to you). Our group companies may also contact you about our other services or products that may be of interest to you. This will be done only in accordance with the privacy settings you have selected in the communication preference setting for your account.

From time to time we aggregate personal information for statistical purposes. Such aggregated personal information shall be anonymised. It may be shared with group companies, Retailers, service providers and other third parties with a view to understanding, analysing and improving our service to you.

### Do we share personal information with third parties?

Yes. Whilst we do not sell your personal information to others, we share it with our group companies and Retailers in order to promote and market our/their services to you (which may include by way of direct mail, telemarketing, email, SMS and/or MMS messages or any other means of communication). This is to keep you informed of products, services and special offers and may continue even after you have stopped using this Site. However, this will be done only in accordance with the privacy settings you have selected in the communication preference setting for your account.

If you do not wish us and our group companies to promote and market products, services and special offers to you, please call or email our [contact centre](https://web.archive.org/en/customerservice/contact-us). If you do not want to be contacted by a Retailer or other users, you will need to tell them or amend your privacy settings accordingly.

We might also share your information with our service providers or group companies in order for them to fulfil our service commitment to you and/or to enable them to perform certain functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending mails and emails, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments and providing customer service. Service providers will have access to your personal information insofar as they need it and may not use it for other purposes.

We require and take reasonable steps to ensure that third parties with whom we share your personal information safeguard it the same way we do.

### How do we use "cookies" and "log files"?

As part of offering and providing customisable and personalised services, we use cookies to store and sometimes track information about your use of this Site (such as your preferences, session information and information on how you visit and access our Site). A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your internet web browser from our web server and stored on your computer, but does not contain any of your personal information. We may also log IP addresses (the electronic addresses of computers connected to the internet) to analyse trends, administer this Site, track user movements on this Site and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use by us, our group companies, Retailers and our advertisers. Please [opt-out​](https://www.google.com/settings/ads?hl=en&sig=ACi0TChgkROGriYusXNlG1rxEt80wuxaV5ngDpePeRy441UopZmOwGRJpid5Orl48KlWIOkYCv6L8h8zpG_Ujz98Ddfy4ZWTZG8IPzYo5OSuNCKlf8653ZmE37-E5WWV8nv29W40iDjFOO81F_Qoki8dHg7FXBMZcLZKlv78fh7fZoJ_kHsI2Ffjm2lJjtRoW-12ao0NlK4SWek0cNz4eHTveAAYA1w1j4ts1L471V2PAmIOyzc5YJELX3J3EvL_L_GLkIs-z6zmVGUQXB912tmiwDk0v57M4g) if you do not wish for such demographic information to be collected by us. 

### What do we do to safeguard personal information?

We use reasonable and current internet security methods and technologies to keep your personal information secure, including restricting unauthorised access to your personal information and using firewalls and secure databases. When you place orders or access your account information, we offer secure socket layer (SSL) technology.

However, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed as completely secure. As a result, although we try hard to protect your personal information provided to us, we cannot guarantee its security and you transmit such information at your own risk.

### What about links to other websites?

This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by this Site. This Site may contain links to other websites. We make no representations or warranties as to the privacy practices of any website operated by a third party and we are not responsible for the content or practices of such websites. You should check the privacy policy for all third party websites you visit to understand their procedures for collecting, using and disclosing personal information.
