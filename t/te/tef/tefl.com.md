 **Principles of Language Learning and Teaching** by _H Douglas Brown_

How do people learn a second language? For almost two decades, Principles of Language Learning and Teaching has been recognized as an exceptional guide to the theoretical foundations of language teaching. The fourth edition offers an overview of the study of Second Language Acquisition, while acting as a reference for the growing storehouse of research, subfields, and specializations of SLA. Features include: Topics on constructivist approaches to SLA, emotional intelligence, the critical period hypothesis, language aptitude, strategies-based instruction (SBI), and more. Additional diagrams and charts to make this edition more accessible, offering visual reference and support for key points. Updated chapter-ending vignettes to provide information on various pedagogical applications and implications of second language research. Improved end-of-chapter activities designed explicitly for in-class group work, pair work, whole-class discussion, and individual self-study. Revised and updated end-of-chapter suggestions for further reading.

**Discussions A-Z Intermediate Teacher's Book: A Resource Book of Speaking Activities (Cambridge Copy Collection)** by _Adrian Wallwork_

 **I am not sure what I would have done without it**  
EFL resource books are not cheap on a Chinese salary, but this one has proved itself an invaluable investment that I have dipped into again and again for my oral English classes.
