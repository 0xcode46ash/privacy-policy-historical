**The Phonology of English as an International Language: New Models, New Norms, New Goals (Oxford Applied Linguistics S.)** by _Jennifer Jenkins_

Academically stimulating, pedagogically useful Dr. Jenkins adds to the Standard English and Core English debate with this very useful study of the pronunciation of English as international lingua franca. By taking what is actually comprehensible, rather than measuring pronunciation against often unattainable, so-called native speaker standards, Jenkins offers a way into establishing an international standard of English, not only in the area of phonology, but with immense possibilities for grammar and lexis.  
On the practical side, Jenkins' work should at last liberate English language classrooms from the tyranny of RP and GA pronunciation and allow teachers to get on with the essential task of preparing learners for international communication.Linguists, applied linguists, EL teachers and teacher educators can all benefit enormously from this excellent work.
