DO I HAVE **CHOICES** REGARDING THE USE OF MY INFORMATION FOR MARKETING PURPOSES?

Best Buy is an opt-out organization. Once we receive your information, we may send you marketing communications that contain valuable offers, promotions and other content. You always have the ability to opt-in or opt-out of receiving future marketing communications from Best Buy.

To opt-out of or opt-in to receiving marketing communications from Best Buy, please take one of the following actions:

1) Follow the directions on a marketing e-mail or direct mail marketing communication from us. All marketing communications from Best Buy will tell you how to stop receiving them.

2) Call 1-888-BEST BUY (1-888-237-8289) and provide your current contact information.

3) Send an e-mail with your current contact information to:

4) Or, send a request with your current contact information to:  
Best Buy  
Attn: Privacy Manager  
P.O. Box 9421

If you send an e-mail or letter request, please be sure to include your full name, address, phone number and e-mail address and indicate specifically what type of marketing communication(s) (e.g., e-mail, direct mail and/or phone) you wish to receive or stop receiving. This will ensure we identify you correctly in our systems and accurately process your request.

Best Buy will take appropriate steps to implement your request to opt-out of or opt-in to receiving marketing communications. Please note that due to production, mailing and system timelines, in order to remove you from our marketing lists, it may take up to:

  * 10 business days for e-mails
  * 30 days for phone calls
  * 6 weeks for direct mail 



Until that change takes effect, you may still receive marketing communications from us.

Also, please note that even though you may have opted out of receiving marketing communications, you may still receive business-related communications such as order confirmations, product recall information, loyalty program membership status or updates or other organization-related communications.

HOW DOES BEST BUY **SECURE** MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?

Whether you are shopping online or in our stores, we have security measures in place and take reasonable precautions to protect against the loss, misuse and unauthorized access of your personal information under our control. Best Buy cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us by e-mail, and you do so at your own risk.

_**Safe Shopping Policy on BestBuy.com**_

Because the security of your personal information is a high priority, we have taken numerous steps to ensure that it is processed confidentially, accurately and securely. The Best Buy Web sites use encryption technology, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to protect your personal information during data transport. SSL encrypts ordering information such as your name, address and credit card number. Our store kiosks also operate over a private, secure network.

_**Choosing a Personal Password on BestBuy.com**_

When you create an online account on BestBuy.com, you need to select a personal password. To maximize your level of protection, you should choose at least 6-30 characters including a combination of both letters and numbers. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password or any account information. You have the ability to purchase on our site without using a password; however, you will have to reenter your personal information each time you use our site in order to make a purchase.

DOES BEST BUY USE **COOKIES, OTHER TECHNOLOGIES** OR **THIRD PARTIES** TO COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT ME?

_**Cookies and Clickstream Technology**_

A cookie is a small data file that a Web site or e-mail may send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive. Our Web sites and e-mails use cookies to create a more personalized shopping experience for visitors to our site. Cookies simulate a continuous connection — they let us "remember" information about your preferences and session, and allow you to move within areas of our Web sites without reintroducing yourself.

Best Buy uses a third party to place cookies on your computer to collect non-personally identifiable information. Although our cookies may contain a unique user ID, they do not collect or store any of your personally identifiable information.

You may choose to set your Web browser to not accept cookies. If your cookies are disabled, you can still view our site, but you cannot create an account or make purchases.

Our Web server automatically collects clickstream information such as the address (or URL) of the Web site that you came from before visiting our site, which pages you visit on our site, which browser you used to view our site, and any search terms you may have entered on our site, among other things.

Our Web site may also use other technologies to track which pages of our Web sites our visitors view. This anonymous clickstream data helps us understand how visitors use our Web site.

_**Third-Party Ad Providers**_

Our Web sites use third-party service providers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and to analyze Web site traffic on our behalf. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Web site, and your interaction with our ads. These companies may use technologies similar to those outlined above to measure the effectiveness of ads and e-mails. They may also use information about your visits to this and other Web sites so that we can provide advertisements about goods and services.

No personally identifiable information is collected in this process. We may share anonymous information with this service provider in an aggregate form, for purposes of analysis and improvement of our site.

If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by our third-party advertiser, visit <http://www.atlasdmt.com/privacy/>.
