For an idea that does not first seem insane, there is no hope. - **Albert Einstein**

The sole motto of Ideate is to discover the best ideas from across the nation that would drive the transformation and empowerment of the society. 

As the saying goes, necessity is the mother of invention. A key problem today is that the society at large still operates with an outdated simile of the mind itself. All that is needed is a newly minted idea, a belief and a vision to spark a revolution. An idea is like a splendid bird that could articulate patterns emerging from chaos. Ideas can evolve and have a life of its own, striving to give the world a small nudge which will set the gears of change in motion on a broad scale. 

Techfest invites the ponderers to the platform of Ideate, bring their ideas to the fore and change the way humans interact with the people and earth to create a real impact. 

**Note:** A team may participate in more than one genre of Ideate. However, if the same idea is presented in more than one genre, then the team stands a chance of winning in only one of those, though it may get other benefits based on the discretion of the judging panel.
