# Tech Support Alert Privacy Policy

**Tech Support Alert   Privacy Policy **

We unconditionally respect the privacy of our newsletter subscribers and site visitors. **This** **is our policy** :

  * **Choice and consent.** We respect the purpose for which our site visitors gave us their email address and other information. We inform users exactly how this information is used and give them choice and consent over this use including the removal of  names immediately upon request.

  * **Third party use.** We do **not** sell, rent, or loan our lists to third parties for e-mail marketing. While we may in the future, sell advertising in our e-mail publications to other companies, we do not allow third parties any other use of our lists.

  * **Unsubscriptions.** We send our newsletters only to those who request them, and immediately unsubscribe those who request it. Sometimes people subscribe for their friends, and while we cannot prevent that, our welcome message to subscribers -- and every issue of our free newsletter -- explain how to subscribe  and unsubscribe. We keep our subscription lists as clean as possible to prevent obsolete e-mails to take unnecessary bandwidth.

  * **Security.** We store subscriber and password files with personal information in a secure manner. We store such files in areas not accessible to Web browsers, or behind password protection, or off-line.
