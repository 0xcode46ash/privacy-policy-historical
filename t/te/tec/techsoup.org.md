## Personal Information We Collect

We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily:

  * When you create a TechSoup profile, we will collect your name, the username and password that you choose, the primary e-mail address you provide to us, and any other information you choose to affiliate with your TechSoup profile.

In addition to their name, title, and email address, visitors who place a donation request with TechSoup Global ("TechSoup Clients") are also required to provide us with their organization's name, type, mission, budget, and contact information.  TechSoup Global retains this information so that we can track donation requests to completion, facilitate customer-service requests, and inform clients of important changes to our program that may affect them.

From time to time, TechSoup Global receives Personal Information about you via offline sources like telephone or fax. We may use this in combination with information collected online in order to improve the services we provide.

## Use of Information We Collect

In general, we use Personal Information you submit to us to provide the Services to you, respond to requests you make, improve the Services, and offer you additional information, opportunities, and functionality.  We may also use your Personal Information to provide you with updates about the Services.

TechSoup Global may share the Personal Information of TechSoup Clients that request Products from TechSoup Global with the company that donated the Product.  These individual records include the organization and contact information provided by the TechSoup Client.  Your choices regarding such sharing of Personal Information are set forth below in the section entitled “Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Information.

If you provide feedback to us, we may use and disclose such feedback for any purpose, provided we will not associate such feedback with your Personal Information.  We will collect any information contained in such communication and will treat any Personal Information included in such communication in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the Personal Information personally identifiable to you.  We may use this Anonymous Information to learn more about how visitors use our Web Sites, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track visitor movement, and to gather general demographic information for reporting and sponsorship purposes.

## Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Information

TechSoup Global regularly sends newsletters and promotional communications to (a) let you know about new donated and discounted products to our online catalog, (b) offer you opportunities to participate in special promotions, events, and surveys, and (c) notify you about services offered by outside partner organizations. These emails will always originate from TechSoup Global, not from any partner organization. You may choose to opt-out from receiving such communications by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the communication or by editing your communication preferences in your account profile.

If you would prefer not to receive postal mailings from us, please send an email to [privacy@techsoup.org](mailto:privacy@techsoup.org) with the subject line, "Print Catalog -- Opt Out." Please make sure to include your name and organization's in the body of your message.

You may also occasionally receive administrative site and service announcement updates via email (such as, but not limited to, notice that we have changed the Services or the Privacy Policy) when we believe it necessary to do so.  You may not opt-out from these announcements, which are not promotional in nature, as they contain important information about changes to our Services. However, if you do not wish to receive these announcements, you have the option to cancel your My TechSoup Account(s).  You understand that any such termination of your account information may involve deletion of your Personal Information from our live databases.  We will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any termination of your account or related deletion of your information.  Note that in some cases, you may request that we delete your Personal Information, but we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your request only after we have fulfilled such requirements).
