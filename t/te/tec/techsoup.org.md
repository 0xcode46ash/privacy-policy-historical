TechSoup Global Privacy Policy and Your California Privacy Rights

This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") is intended to inform you of the policies and procedures of TechSoup Global ("TechSoup Global", "we" or "us") and its affiliates. We take the privacy and protection of your Personal Information (as defined below) very seriously. We may collect Personal Information from you in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy when you visit websites operated by TechSoup Global (the "Web Sites"). 

## Definitions

"Account" means a My TechSoup Profile account.

"Anonymous Information" means information not associated with or linked to your Personal Information; Anonymous Information, by itself, does not permit the identification of individual persons.

"Personal Information" means your contact information, including — but not limited to — your name, mailing address, telephone number, and email address and any other non-public information that is associated with your contact information.

"Products" means the donated products we make available through the Web Sites.

"TechSoup Clients" means visitors to the Web Sites who place a donation request with TechSoup Global. 

## Visitor Consent

BY VISITING OUR WEB SITES AND USING ANY OF THE SERVICES AVAILABLE THROUGH THE WEB SITES (THE "SERVICES"), YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED, AS WELL AS IN COUNTRIES WHERE PRIVACY LAWS MAY BE LESS STRINGENT, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES. BY USING THE SERVICES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU ARE EXPRESSLY CONSENTING TO SUCH PROCESSES. TO THE EXTENT YOU PROVIDE PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT A NAMED PERSON OR ENTITY THAT IS NOT A CURRENT USER OF OUR SERVICES, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THAT PERSON OR ENTITY’S CONSENT TO DO SO.

## General Security

TechSoup Global takes commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial precautions to prevent the loss and misuse of Personal Information under our control. However, no company or entity, including TechSoup Global, can fully eliminate security risks associated with gathering Personal Information on our Web Sites. (Please see our Terms of Use for more information.)

## Personal Information We Collect

We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily:

  * When you create an Account, we will collect your name, the username and password that you choose, the primary email email address you provide to us, and any other information you choose to affiliate with your Account. 
  * When you enter any information, including Personal Information, into any posting or comments within the Services, we will collect such information. 
  * When you respond to one of our surveys, we will collect any information contained in such survey responses. 
  * When you leave us feedback or request support, we will collect any information that is contained in your feedback or support request. 
  * When you contact us by sending us an email, we will collect your email address and any information contained in the email you send us. 



In addition to their name, title, and email address, TechSoup Clients are also required to provide us with their organization's name, type, mission, budget, and contact information. TechSoup Global retains this information so that it can track donation requests to completion, facilitate customer-service requests, and inform clients of important changes to programs that may affect them.

From time to time, TechSoup Global receives Personal Information about you via offline sources like telephone or fax. We may use this in combination with information collected online in order to improve the services we provide.

## Data You Submit About Third Parties

If you choose to use the "Tell a Friend" function on the Web Sites, or if you choose to refer a nonprofit entity to us, you will provide information about such third party (such as an individual, nonprofit organization, or other entity) through the Services, such as the third party’s name and email address. If the third party registers with us, such third party will become a user of the Services and subject to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If the third party does not register for the Services, we may retain information about such third party and will protect any Personal Information provided in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## Information We Collect via Technology

When you access any part of our Web Sites, our Web server software automatically logs information provided by your network connection and Web browser software, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your network connection and the type of Web browser and operating system that you are using. Our Web server may also log the URL of the file that you are requesting, the current date and time, and the URL of the last Web page requested by your Web browser. 

We may utilize cookies on our Web Sites to store your login information (if any), purchase information, and your personal preferences for the Services. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). 

We may utilize Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses cookies and page tags to gather information relating to the usage of our Web Sites. The information generated by cookies (including IP addresses) and page tags is transmitted to and stored on Google servers. This information may then be analyzed and compiled into reports on Web Site activity. The use and disclosure of information stored on Google servers is governed by Google’s privacy policy, not ours. 

You have the option of disabling or not accepting cookies by changing the preferences in your Web browser. If you opt to disable cookies, you will still be able to access our Web Sites. However, you will not be able to use certain features of the Web Sites, including, but not limited to, the My TechSoup functionality, posting to the TechSoup Global message boards (Community Discussion Forums), and placing requests for Products through the Web Sites. 

## Donation Requests Made Through Our Site

Online selection and fulfillment services for Products may be conducted either by us, the donor, or by one of our third party partners. You acknowledge and agree that, in some cases, you may be required to leave our Web Sites to select Products and place your Product request. Our third party partners will make available to you their website policies governing their collection of Personal Information from you. Any Personal Information you provide to such third parties will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy and website terms of use, and not to this Privacy Policy or the TechSoup Terms of Use.

## Use of Information We Collect

In general, we use Personal Information you submit to us to provide the Services to you, respond to requests you make, improve the Services, and offer you additional information, opportunities, and functionality. We may also use your Personal Information to provide you with updates about the Services.

If you provide feedback to us, we may use and disclose such feedback for any purpose, provided we will not associate such feedback with your Personal Information. We will collect any information contained in such communication and will treat any Personal Information included in such communication in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the Personal Information personally identifiable to you. We may use and disclose Anonymous Information in our discretion and without restriction.

## Disclosing Information to Third Parties

We may share Anonymous Information with our partners, sponsors, and donors. For example, we may share Anonymous Information about individual organizations where it is necessary to secure funding to ensure the continued availability of our services or to develop outreach programs with our partners. Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not disclose to or share your Personal Information with third parties, unless you ask or authorize us to do so. 

TechSoup Global may share the Personal Information of TechSoup Clients that request Products from TechSoup Global with the company that donated the Product. These individual records include the organization and contact information provided by the TechSoup Client. Your choices regarding such sharing of Personal Information are set forth below in the section entitled "Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Information."

TechSoup Global may also share your organization's information with selected vendors, business partners, and other organizations that assist TechSoup Global with providing you with some of the services and features of the Services and helping communicate with our users (including in connection with payment processing and services provided via the Web Sites). 

We may share some or all of your Personal Information with our affiliates and will require our affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy when dealing with any Personal Information shared by TechSoup. Your choices regarding such sharing of information are set forth in the section entitled "Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Information." If our organization or all or a portion of our assets are acquired by another organization, your Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of TechSoup Global or its assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. You hereby consent to TechSoup Global sharing your Personal Information under the above circumstances.

We may (and you authorize us to) disclose Personal Information we collect from you if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us, (b) enforce any agreement we may have entered into with you and to enforce the Privacy Policy, or (c) protect and defend the rights or property of TechSoup Global, other users of the Web Sites, or third parties. 

## Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Information

TechSoup Global regularly sends newsletters and promotional communications to (a) let you know about new donated and discounted products to our online catalog, (b) offer you opportunities to participate in special promotions, events, and surveys, and (c) notify you about services offered by outside partner organizations. These emails will always originate from TechSoup Global, not from any partner organization. You may choose to opt out from receiving such communications by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the communication or by editing your communication preferences in your Account.

If you would prefer not to receive postal mailings from us, please send an email to [privacy@techsoup.org](mailto:privacy@techsoup.org) with the subject line "Print Catalog — Opt Out." Please make sure to include your name and organization's name in the body of your message. 

If you are a California resident, you may request and obtain from us, once a year, free of charge, certain information regarding what Personal Information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. This information would include a list of the categories of Personal Information that we shared and the names and mailing addresses of all third parties with which we shared Personal Information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to [privacy@techsoup.org](mailto:privacy@techsoup.org). 

You may also occasionally receive administrative site and service announcement updates via email (such as, but not limited to, notice that we have changed the Services, Terms of Use, or the Privacy Policy) when we believe it necessary to do so. You may not opt out from these announcements, which are not promotional in nature, as they contain important information about changes to our Services, Terms of Use, or the Privacy Policy. However, if you do not wish to receive these announcements, you have the option to cancel your Account(s). You understand that any such termination of your Account information may involve deletion of your Personal Information from our live databases. We will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any termination of your Account or related deletion of your information. Note that in some cases, you may request that we delete your Personal Information, but we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your request only after we have fulfilled such requirements).

When we delete information that we have collected from or about you, it will be deleted from our active databases but may remain in our archives. 

## How to Change Your Information

If you would like to change any of your Personal Information in your Account, you can use the "Edit My Profile" link from your My TechSoup homepage or you can send a request to change, correct, or remove information to [privacy@techsoup.org](mailto:privacy@techsoup.org). 

If you would like to change any of the information contained in an organization record on TechSoup Global, you may do so by following the instructions at Edit Organization Profile on TechSoup.org. You will first be required to log in to My TechSoup, or call us, to verify your authority to make changes and will then be taken to the organization profile page to make your desired changes. If you experience difficulty altering the organization profile, you should contact TechSoup Global Customer Service via email at [privacy@techsoup.org](mailto:privacy@techsoup.org). 

## Surveys and Case Studies

Occasionally, TechSoup Global or one of our donating partners may ask TechSoup Clients who will receive or have received product donations to participate in a case study, provide a testimonial, or complete a survey. If a donating partner requires the client’s willingness to participate in any such study as a prerequisite for receiving a donation, this will be explicitly stated in the guidelines for that donation program. 

## Links to Outside Web Sites

This privacy statement applies solely to information collected through the Web Sites. Our Web Sites may contain links to outside websites for your convenience, and such links do not signify our endorsement of such websites or their contents. TechSoup Global has no control over, does not review, and is not responsible for the privacy practices of or content displayed on other websites. We encourage our visitors to be aware when they leave our Web Sites, and to read the privacy policies of each and every third party web site that collects information from you. 

## Shared Areas of the Services

Please be aware that if you enter any Personal Information into shared sections of the Services, such as in message boards, that Personal Information will be displayed to anyone who has access to these sections of the Service. TechSoup Global has no control over, and will have no liability to you regarding other users’ use or disclosure of such Personal Information.
