**The NewsFactor Network**

**Privacy Policy**

The policies below are applicable to the above-named online services (collectively the "Service") produced and maintained by the NewsFactor NetworkTM. 

NewsFactor Network collects personally identifying information only during registration. In addition, information is collected in certain portions of the Service in which guests specifically and knowingly provide such information along with content submissions, community postings (i.e., chat or bulletin boards), suggestions, or voting. NewsFactor Network may use such information for its internal purposes, including but not limited to editorial and feedback purposes. In the event NewsFactor Network plans to publicly post any such information on a site, guests are provided prior notification of such posting. 

Information submitted at the time of registration or content submission may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by NewsFactor Network and may be shared with companies that have been pre-screened by NewsFactor Network. If a guest objects to such use for any reason, he/she may stop that use -- either by e-mail request or by modifying his/her registration information online. 

Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes while at the site. Cookies make Web-surfing easier by, among other things, saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences for you. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and you'll find cookies at most major Web sites. 

Cookies help make NewsFactor Network Web sites better, by showing how and when guests use the site. Many content improvements and updates are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. 

Here are some other examples of how NewsFactor Network uses cookies: 

A cookie lets the Service remember that you've registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities at our sites. Similarly, if there are any stores within the Service, a temporary cookie tracks which products you've selected while shopping. The cookie expires once you're done shopping. Letting it do the record-keeping saves you the trouble of entering information over and over again during a single visit. If you decline this cookie, you may have difficulty ordering your selections. 

The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information although it may enable NewsFactor Network to relate a user's use of the Service to personally identifying information that has previously been submitted by the user, if any. 

You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. These cookies are sent from third-party computers and are subject to such third parties' policies. By using this service, you expressly agree that the NewsFactor Network bears no liability whatsoever, for real or perceived privacy invasion or usage tracking technologies used by third-party ad services used by various advertisers. You agree that the NewsFactor Network has no control over content served by third-party ad services, and that any remedies must be sought solely against those services. If you are unable to accept these terms, we would understand and respect your decision not to use the NewsFactor Network service. It is our hope, however, that third-party ad servers become subject to governmental regulation and industry standards designed to protect the privacy of our readers. 

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies. However, it is likely that most areas of the site will not function properly if you do so. 

NewsFactor Network reserves the right to change this policy at any time by notifying guests, through a notice posted on the Service or by email, of the existence of a new privacy policy or any updates. 

ATTENTION KIDS: IF YOU ARE 16 OR UNDER, YOU MUST GET PERMISSION FROM YOUR MOM OR DAD BEFORE YOU DO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE: 

  * SEND ANY INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF OR OTHERS 
  * BUY ANYTHING 
  * ENTER ANY CONTEST, GAME OR SWEEPSTAKES 



IF YOU GET PERMISSION FROM YOUR MOM OR DAD TO SUBMIT YOUR NAME TO BE PUBLICLY POSTED ON THE SERVICE, YOU SHOULD NEVER USE YOUR FULL NAME. JUST SUBMIT YOUR FIRST NAME OR INITIALS.    


Please Note: We request that all editorial and PR matters be handled [here](https://web.archive.org/perl/contact_form.pl?to=editorial). Thank you.
