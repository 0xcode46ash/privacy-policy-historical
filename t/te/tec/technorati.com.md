# Technorati: Privacy Policy

### Information Collection and Use

Sifry Consulting is the sole owner of the information collected on this Web site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Sifry Consulting collects information from its users at several different points on its Web site.  
  
### Registration

In order to use the member-only areas of this website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (name and email address) and to create a username & password. This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. Sifry Consulting does not require the user to provide demographic information, such as income level and gender, nor unique identifiers such as social security number.  
  
### Order

We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (i.e., name, telephone and shipping address) and financial information (i.e., credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.  
  
### Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our Web site. For instance, by setting a cookie on our Web site, the user would not have to log in with a password, thereby saving time each time they visit our site. Should the user want to temporarily disable this function they can do so by clicking the log-out link. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, the user will not be able to view the Members-only areas, like their custom watchlists. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.  
  
### Log Files

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.  
  
### Sharing

We do not share information about individuals with anyone other than the credit card processors and the shipping company. Since our business requires us to pay royalties based on the sale of each of our audio programs, we must report aggregate sales figures to the publishers with whom we work. However, we do not share any information about individual customers with publishers.

We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.  
  
### Links

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Sifry Consulting, Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users, when they leave our site, to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.  
  
### Newsletter

If a user wishes to subscribe to any of our newsletters, we ask them to register by providing their contact information (name and email address) and to create a username and password.  
  
### Surveys & Contests

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving use of and satisfaction with this Web site.  
  
### Spread the Words Campaign

If a user elects to participate in our referral program for recruiting friends to become a customer of the site, we ask the friend during the registration stage for the technorati.com user name of the recruiter. Sifry Consulting uses this referral information to enable both the user and the friend to collect rewards. 

When users log in to their own accounts, they will be able to see the status of their friends' participation in the program in a non-personally identifiable form (e.g., a tally of a user's referrals, including the rewards the user has earned as a result of the friend's activities.) 

Friends recruited through this program will register with us and enjoy all of the benefits of being a user.  
  
If you have any questions about the security at our Web site, you can send an email to [custservice@technorati.com](mailto:custservice@technorati.com).  
  
### Special Offers

We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see description of our choice/opt-out policy below.  
  
### Site and Service Updates

We send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user regarding updates to our site and service and issues relating to their account via email or phone. 

### Correcting/Updating Personal Information

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update, or remove that user's personal data. To notify Sifry Consulting of a change, you can go to the Members section located at [http://www.technorati.com/members/](https://web.archive.org/members/?PHPSESSID=4cc6dff33885c822bfbaaf6d278cef23) or email Customer Support at [custservice@technorati.com](mailto:custservice@technorati.com).  
  
### Choice/Opt-out

Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our Web site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our order form has an ‘opt-out’ mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists. 

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying with unsubscribe in the subject line of the email or by emailing us at [remove@technorati.com](mailto:remove@technorati.com) or by contacting [custservice@technorati.com](mailto:custservice@technorati.com). 

Users of our Web site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party.  
  
### Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
