In addition, we may disclose certain personal identifying information about you to third parties, or to other Miller Freeman divisions, under the circumstances described below. 

_Private information:_ We treat your email address and fax number as private information that might not ordinarily be known to others and we do not share this information with third parties unless you have consented to such disclosure or such disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect our members, subscribers, or registrants from misuse or unauthorized use of the Miller Freeman, Inc. sites; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our members, subscribers, registrants, or the public.

_Personal information:_ We consider other personal identifying information you provide (such as your name, mailing address and telephone number), any optional information you provide (such as your job title and/or other demographics), and your computer's IP address to be personal information but also a type of information that would generally be available to others. We may provide this information to our business partners and to certain select third parties unless you tell us otherwise. As with private information, personal information also may be disclosed if disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect our members, subscribers, or registrants from misuse or unauthorized use of the Miller Freeman, Inc. sites; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our members, subscribers, registrants, or the public.

_Aggregate information:_ Miller Freeman, Inc. sometimes provides aggregate usage or tracking information to third parties. This aggregate information does not contain user- specific information that reveals the identity of a member, subscriber or registrant. We may share this information with anyone since it does not personally identify you and is not correlated to your personal identifying information.

_Information you choose to disclose to third parties:_ From time to time, Miller Freeman, Inc. may allow third parties to advertise on our sites, or may provide links to sites we think may be of interest to you. If you choose to disclose personal identifying information directly to one of our advertisers or to a site to which we have linked, the information you disclose will be subject to that advertiser's or that site's privacy policy, if one exists. We also may allow third parties to sponsor or co-sponsor contests, promotions or surveys on our site.

Any information you choose to submit will be subject to the sponsor's privacy policy, if one exists. Although Miller Freeman, Inc. encourages third parties to adhere to appropriate privacy standards and policies, we are not responsible for the actions or policies of such parties.
