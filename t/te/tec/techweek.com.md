# TechWeek Privacy Statement

**TechWeek Privacy Statement**

_TechWeek_ is committed to protecting your privacy. Here is our policy: 

When you send a message to the editor (editor@techweek.com) or to one of our writers or editors, we may, where appropriate, publish such messages (or portions of such messages) in _TechWeek_ 's Feedback column (both in print and on our Web site), including your e-mail address. If you do not wish to be quoted, or if you do not wish your e-mail address to be published, it is your responsibility to tell us and we will respect your request. 

We download a weekly log of accesses to our Web site. This contains the IP addresses of users accessing our site. Typically, this is an address assigned "dynamically" (that is, randomly) by your Internet service provider, in which case it is not tied to your specific personal computer's IP address. This information is used internally by _TechWeek_ to better understand reader interests and Web page responses. 

We do not issue "cookies" to our readers. 

_TechWeek_ does not sell, trade or rent personal information collected on our Web site to others.

_TechWeek_ may provide aggregate statistics about our Web site traffic patterns and related site information to advertisers, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. 

By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by _TechWeek_. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. 

_TechWeek_ welcomes your questions and comments about privacy. Please send e-mail to [webmaster@techweek.com](mailto:amaraa@techweek.com).
