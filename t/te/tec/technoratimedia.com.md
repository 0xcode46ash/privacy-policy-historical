# Technorati Media | Privacy Policy

_Version effective: June 13, 2011_

Technorati Media (“we,” “our” or “us”) is an online advertising network _._ Our customers include advertisers and other ad networks (our “Clients”). These Clients buy and sell space on websites, blogs, and other media (“Publishers”), and we provide the technology that displays their ads on the Publisher sites. We may receive the ads directly from the Client and serve them directly on the Publisher site, or there may be other ad networks, agencies or exchanges (each of which may be our Client) situated between the advertiser and the Publisher site. As part of our services, we will attempt to find Publishers where the ads from our Clients are most likely to be helpful and appreciated, as well as using information received from Publishers as described below. To do this, we may collect information about the types of people that visit the Publisher site, view the ads, and click on the ads to learn more about the product, service or company. The more we learn about the audience, the better the fit of ads with Publishers, and the more useful the Publisher site is to the audience. That’s where you come in; as part of that audience we are interested in the types of Publishers you visit, and the types of ads you are likely to be interested in. That way we can try to avoid showing you ads for products that are _not_ interesting to you. Your privacy is important to us so we have developed this policy to give you details as to what information about you we will collect when we perform these services, and what choices you have relating to our use of that information. __

### **What This Policy Covers**

This policy only addresses information that we collect as a function of providing services to Clients and displaying ads on Publisher sites. It does not address information and privacy issues relating to the access and use of the Technorati Media website itself, or any of the websites that Technorati Media, or its parent company Technorati, Inc., owns, controls or operates separate from the services we provide to our Clients and Publishers. That uses of information is addressed by Technorati, Inc.’s general privacy policy found at [www.technorati.com/privacy-policy](http://www.technorati.com/privacy-policy).

### **Information Collection & Use**

Information can be either Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) or non-Personally Identifiable Information (“non-PII”). PII is information that directly identifies you, such as your name, address, email address, and telephone number. Non-PII is information that is not specifically associated with your identity, such as context information, records of what you click on while web browsing (such as a hyperlink), click-stream data, demographic and behavioral data, the IP address from which a website or ad is viewed or accessed, the ads displayed on a Publisher site, which ads you click on and how often, and generally other aggregate or statistical information that is not PII.

_We do not collect PII as part of our services relating to ads served for Clients on Publisher sites._ If you click on an ad served by us, you may be directed to a third party site, where the advertiser may request PII from you. If so, the collection and use of your PII is governed by the privacy policy for that advertiser’s website, and not this policy.

We use the non-PII collected from Publisher sites and through Client ads to provide our services to you, Clients and Publishers, selecting the ads that you see, so that you are more likely to see ads that are useful to you (also known as “targeting”), internal business operations, planning, evaluation, improvement and enhancement of performance of our services, and external performance reporting. We may add non-PII from other sources (e.g., other ad networks, information provided by Clients) to the non-PII that we collect, again for the above purposes.

### **Information Sharing**

We sometimes share aggregated information with our Clients and Publishers, in particular advertisers, to help them improve their ads and offer you a better experience. We do not link this aggregate non-PII with any PII from any source, so you will not be identified as an individual to any Client. We may share aggregated statistics on our services and performance with Clients, Publishers, business partners or outside vendors without permission. As part of our agreements with Clients and Publishers, we require them to use any information they receive from us in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, and with this Privacy Policy.

Sometimes we use other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf. For example, as noted above, some ads are served through multiple networks, agencies, exchanges and ad servers. We will share your information with these providers only for the purpose of allowing us to supply our services and deliver the ads to the Publishers.

We also reserve the right to disclose any information we collects if we believe in good faith that its release is necessary to (1) comply with the law; (2) enforce or apply terms and conditions of use and other agreements; (3) or protect the rights, property or safety of our employees, Clients, Publishers, affiliates, and others.

Finally, in the event Technorati Media experiences a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, any information governed by this policy will be part of the assets transferred. We reserve the right to make such a transfer, and you consent to the transfer and continued use of such information by the acquiring party, but only in accordance with the terms of this policy.

### **Collection Technology and Opt-out**

We collect non-PII by many means, but all of them are based in some way on technology associated with the ads served on Publisher sites. In particular, we use cookies, pixels, web beacons and other types of collection technology.

A cookie is a small text file stored on your computer to track session data, identify that your computer has visited a Publisher site or seen an ad before, and perform other useful functions. A cookie takes up only a small amount of space in a folder on your hard drive, and is not an applet or other type of program. A session cookie expires when you exit your browser. A persistent cookie stays on your computer until it is deleted.

You can set your browser to reject all cookies, ask your permission before accepting a cookie, or to remove all cookies. Without the cookies, however, you may not be able to experience all of the features of the site or ad.

Pixels and web beacons are a line of code embedded in a website, ad or used by an ad server to track navigation and other activity on a particular webpage (e.g., which ads are clicked).

Third parties (including, without limitation, Clients and Publishers) may use cookies or other information collection technology on their sites. We have no access or control over these uses or technology. This policy does not cover the use of cookies or other technology or collection of information by any third parties.

### **Opting Out**

You can opt out of our ad optimization in two ways:

1\. Block all cookies by disabling cookie use in your browser. This may cause some sites to work incorrectly.

2\. Use our opt-out tool: [Click here to opt-out](https://portal.technoratimedia.com/optout) by setting a special opt-out cookie that tells our system to ignore you.

If you choose to opt out using our tool, you need to repeat the process for each computer or browser you use, and every time you clear your cookies.

### **Security and Confidentiality**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. We review these safeguards regularly and take commercially reasonable steps to ensure they meet current industry standards. You should be aware, however, that no system has perfect security and Technorati Media cannot and does not assume responsibility for the security of information beyond such industry standards and its legal obligations.

### **Collection of Information from Children**

Our services, and the ads we deliver, are not intended for children under fourteen (14) years of age. We do not knowingly develop services or direct ads at children. Furthermore, as noted above, we do not knowingly collect any PII from children or otherwise.

### **Changes to This Policy**

This policy is a living document that will change due to internal and external requirements. We may modify this document as we add new features and new services. Changes in information collection practices and technology may also suggest changes in the policy. Changes in the law may also require us to modify our information collection and use practices, which modifications will be reflected in this policy. Accordingly, Technorati Media reserves the right to modify this policy at any time. Although we will attempt to make you aware of material changes through posts on the [www.technoratimedia.com](http://www.technoratimedia.com/) website and other appropriate places, we are not obliged to do so. You should check the date (shown above) on the version of this policy posted on the website occasionally to remain current.
