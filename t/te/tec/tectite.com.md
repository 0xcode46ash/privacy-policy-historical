# Our Privacy Policy

At Root Software, we consider your privacy to be of paramount importance.

### Your contact details are safe with us

We don't like spam and we actively fight spammers!Â  We will _never_ give your contact details to anyone else.

We do provide you with the opportunity to purchase our partners' products from our website. 

If you use our purchase page to purchase these products, your contact details are sent to the author of the software so that they can deliver the product to you and provide you with support. We encourange you to check the privacy policy of the authors of the product you want to purchase. 

We do not share our customer lists or user lists with anyone, including our partners. 

### We oppose spam!

We don't purchase lists of email addresses, and we don't use automated bulk-mail software programs. 

Our free [FormMail](https://web.archive.org/formmailpage.php?WWWTECTITE=e5smg5khp1lbnpnq0mkckpe870) product actively fights spam on the internet. 

We use and recommend [Spam Gourmet](http://www.spamgourmet.com/) and [TMDA](http://tmda.net/) for challenge/response spam protection.

### We don't pester you

If you download our product we may send you one email with some information to assist you in evaluating it. About a week later we may send you one followup email. That's it.

Occasionally, we release a new version and we will send you one email to let you know about it.

Very occasionally, we may send you some information about our products or a partner's product or about special offers. 

If you register on our [forums](https://web.archive.org/vbforums/index.php?WWWTECTITE=e5smg5khp1lbnpnq0mkckpe870), they perform some automated tasks which involve emailing you. You can adjust your user profile to prevent these activities. 

### Update notices

Some of our products (in particular, FormMail) regularly check our server for updates. When a newer version is found, it will attempt to email you regarding the new version. 

Note that in the case of FormMail, it is **your server** sending you email - we have no involvement in the process. 

These update checks are entirely automated, and we have no direct control over them. We also don't receive any information about who is performing an update check (other than our normal web server logs). 

You can [switch off these update checks](https://web.archive.org/fmdoc/check_for_new_version.php?WWWTECTITE=e5smg5khp1lbnpnq0mkckpe870). 

### Your privacy and our forums

Our forums are specifically setup to prevent other users from accessing your email address. 

There is a [Private Message](https://web.archive.org/vbforums/private.php?WWWTECTITE=e5smg5khp1lbnpnq0mkckpe870) system so that forum users can communicate with each other in private, but they can do that only via the forums, not by using email addresses. Again, you can disable this feature. 

### If you don't want us to contact you...
