  1. **General**

TechOnLine respects the privacy of every individual who visits techonline.com (the "Web Site"). This Privacy Policy outlines the information TechOnLine will collect and how we will use that information. This Policy will also instruct you on what to do if you do not want your personal information collected or shared.

  2. **Personally-Identifiable Information**

There are cases where TechOnLine may ask you for personally-identifiable information such as your name, mailing address, and email address. For example, we request personally-identifiable information when you register as a member of the Web Site, for online shopping or transactions, or for other services that require registration or subscription. TechOnLine will not collect any personally-identifiable information about you unless you provide it to us voluntarily.

When you do provide us with personally-identifiable information, TechOnLine may:

      * Store and process that information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services; 
      * Use that information to contact you for informational, marketing and promotional purposes; 
      * Share that information with selected sponsors of the Web Site who provide products and services which we believe may interest you; 
      * Disclose that information to third parties when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) TechOnLine's rights or property, other members or users of the Web Site, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; and 
      * Disclose that information to third parties when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

Except as stated in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise stated at the time personally-identifiable information is gathered, we will not provide personally-identifiable information to third parties.

In case you would like to remove or change some personally-identifiable information, you may do so by contacting our Customer Support Department at [support@techonline.com](mailto:support@techonline.com). (Remember, however, that removing some or all of your personally-identifiable information may limit your ability to access some or all of the features and services of the Web Site.)

  3. **Financial Information**
 ****

TechOnLine may ask you for certain information (such as your credit card number and expiration date) when you order products from the TechOnLine Store. TechOnLine may use this information for processing your order and may share this information with credit card processing companies, the merchants from whom you have ordered products, and any other third party that may need the information in order for your order to be processed. These organizations have their own privacy and data collection practices. TechOnLine has no responsibility for these independent policies.

  4. **Non-Personally-Identifiable Information**
 ****

TechOnLine may also collect information about you that is not personally-identifiable. Examples of this type of information may include your age, gender, interests and preferences. TechOnLine will not collect any such information about you unless you provide it to us voluntarily. TechOnLine may share this information with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. For example, TechOnLine may inform a sponsor that the membership of the Web Site is x percent females and y percent males. This data is used to customize the Web Site's content and advertising, and to deliver a better experience for our members and users.

  5. **Information Collected Automatically**
 ****

TechOnLine may also automatically collect non-personally-identifiable information about your use of the Web Site, such as the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account), the date and time you access the Web Site, and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our Web Site. This information will not be linked to personally-identifiable information. TechOnLine may use this information to analyze and enhance the Web Site, and may aggregate this information and share such aggregated information with business partners, sponsors and other third parties. 

  6. **Information We May Place Automatically On Your Computer's Hard Drive**
 ****

When you view the Web Site, we may store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a "Cookie" or similar file and will help us in many ways. For example, Cookies allow us to tailor the Web Site to better match your interests and preferences. With most Internet browsers, you can erase Cookies from you computer hard drive, block all Cookies, or receive a warning before a Cookie is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. 

  7. **Children**

The Web Site is not directed at individuals under thirteen years of age, and TechOnLine does not intend to collect any personally-identifiable information from such individuals. 

  8. **Links to Other Web Sites**
 ****

The Web Site allows links to various other web sites. TechOnLine assumes no responsibility for the information practices of sites you are able to access through the Web Site. These links to other sites do not imply affiliation or endorsement of a linked site. 

  9. **Security**
 ****

At TechOnLine, our customers are our most treasured asset. That's why we make providing a safe and secure purchase environment our top priority. We recognize the importance of protecting credit-card transactions online. While we are confident that transactions on our site are secure, we are aware that you may have concerns about purchasing electronic components and computer parts online. To ensure that every transaction is safe, TechOnLine uses the most advanced encryption technology available. 

By making your purchase on our secure server, you are protected by the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology utilized by most popular browsers, including Netscape and Microsoft Internet Explorer. Our secure server software is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. It uses powerful encryption technology to protect your credit card information while it travels over the web. The Web Site employs [VeriSign technology](http://www.verisign.com/), the industry standard encryption technology, to help ensure your information does not get into the wrong hands. 

This technology allows us to use the most advanced encryption tools necessary to protect the information transmitted between your computer and our server. Through encryption, the personal information you enter is converted into code that is then securely dispatched over the Internet. 

Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online—for example, via message boards or chat—that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While TechOnLine strives to protect your information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk. 

The importance of security for all personally-identifiable information associated with our users and members is of utmost concern to us. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be absolutely guaranteed to be secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personally-identifiable information, TechOnLine can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your personally-identifiable information, we will take reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems. 

Your account on the Web Site is password protected so that only you can access it and view the member information relevant to the account. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. TechOnLine will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or email. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information. Remember to sign out of your account on the Web Site and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if your computer is accessible to others or if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet café. 

  10. **Your Acceptance Of These Terms**
 ****

By using the Web Site, you signify your assent to the TechOnLine Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not use the Web Site. Your continued use of the Web Site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
