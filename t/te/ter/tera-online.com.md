# Privacy Policy | TERA

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING LEGAL DOCUMENTS CAREFULLY.

En Masse Entertainment, Inc. ("En Masse", "we," or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the Personal Information that you may provide us while using our site located at [http://tera.enmasse.com](http://tera.enmasse.com/en "http://tera.enmasse.com") (the "Site") and the services and features offered through the Site. Your use of the Site is subject to your agreement to the terms of this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") and the Terms of Service.

YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY IS A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR USING THE SITE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE SERVICES EN MASSE PERFORMS ON BEHALF OF ITS AFFILIATES. BY USING THE SITE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY'S TERMS AND CONDITIONS. 

**1\. Personal Information.** As used in this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" is information that would allow someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your full name, address, telephone number, or email address. Personal Information does not include aggregated information that, by itself, does not permit the identification of individual persons (like statistics about how many persons visited the Site last month, or how many visitors are male and how many are female). En Masse does not collect any Personal Information from you unless you provide it to us voluntarily. If you refuse to divulge your Personal Information when requested, you may not be able to access certain areas of the Site. 

**2\. Site Registration.** In order for you to register for an account En Masse may require you to provide us with certain information including your name, birth date, e-mail address, and mailing address. We do not require Personal Information to obtain access to the Site; however, you will not be able to access areas that require registration.

**3\. Non-Personal Information.** In addition to account registration data, En Masse will automatically collect certain non-Personal Information about your use of the Site. We might collect, among other things, information concerning the type of Internet browser or computer operating system you are using, the domain name of your Internet service provider, your browsing behavior through the Site, and the web site or advertisement that was linked to or from the Site when you visited. To do this, we may use cookies and other technology (see below). Your visits to the Site, and information provided through these technologies, will be anonymous unless you provide us with Personal Information or have provided such information in the past. This information is used to help improve the Site, analyze trends, and administer the Site.

**4\. Cookie and Related Technologies.** En Masse uses cookies and other technologies to collect demographic information, personalize your experience on the Site and monitor advertisements and other activities. Cookies are small files downloaded to your computer (if your browser is enabled to accept cookies) to track movements within web sites. We may link cookie information to Personal Information. We use cookies and other technology to customize your experience within the Site. Personal Information collected through the use of these technologies will be handled according to this Privacy Policy.

Most Internet browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. You should refer to your browser instructions or "Help" screen to learn more about how to manage cookies. Please note, however, that if you block cookies, some portions of the Site may not function properly.

We do not control cookies in third party ads, and you are encouraged to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology. The ads appearing on the Site may be delivered to you by third-party advertising companies. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements on the Site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

We also maintain log files which contain Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. We use log files to monitor traffic on the Site, to report information to our advertisers and to troubleshoot technical problems. In the event of user abuse of the Site, we may block certain IP addresses. IP addresses may be used to personally identify you in order to enforce our Terms of Service and any applicable end user license agreement.

**5\. Statistical and Usage Data.** When you use the Site, we may retrieve information about your hardware system and how our services are used, including your IP address. We use this information to enable you to use the services offered through the Site over the Internet. We also use this information to better understand the behavior and preferences of our customers, so that we can improve our products and services.

**6\. How Personal Information is Used.** The Personal Information collected from you will be used to operate the Site and to provide the products or services or carry out the transactions you have requested or authorized. 

In support of these uses, En Masse may use Personal Information to provide you with more effective service, to improve the Site and any related En Masse products or services, and to make the Site easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information. In order to offer you a more consistent experience in your interactions with En Masse, information collected by the Site may be combined with information collected by En Masse from other sources.

We may use your Personal Information to provide you with information about the product or service that you have purchased or inquired about. Additionally, we may send you information about other En Masse products and services, and/or share information with En Masse partners so they may send you information about their products and services.

We may merge Site-visitation data with demographic information, and we may use this information to provide more relevant content. We may combine Site-visitation data with your Personal Information in order to provide you with personalized content.   
En Masse may hire other companies to provide products or services on our behalf, and we may provide such companies with Personal Information to help them perform their duties. 

En Masse may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on En Masse; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of En Masse or its affiliates; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of En Masse employees or agents, users of En Masse products or services, or members of the public.

Personal information collected on the Site may be stored and processed in the State of Washington or any other state or country in which En Masse or its affiliates or agents maintain facilities, and by using the Site you consent to any such transfer of information to another state or country.

You will be deemed to have consented to the disclosure to, and use by, a subsequent owner or operator of the Site, of any Personal Information contained in our database for such site, if En Masse or one of its companies assigns all of its rights and obligations regarding the use of your Personal Information at the time of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, sale of all or substantially all of En Masse's assets to a subsequent owner or operator, or similar event.

Please do not use your real name or the real name of another person when selecting a username. Please note that your username will be available to the Internet's general public while you participate in some services, like message boards or forums, so you should exercise discretion when using these services. We are not responsible for protecting such information that you may disclose to third parties through our services.

**7\. Children Under the Age of 13.** Because the Site is not directed to children under the age of 13, we prohibit registration to persons under age 13. If you are under the age of 13, you may not create an account on the Site. We will not knowingly collect, maintain, or disclose any Personal Information from children under the age of 13.

**8\. Children Between the Ages of 13 and 18.** In order to protect the privacy interests of younger Internet users, En Masse does not allow children under the age of 18 to use our services without the consent of their parents. En Masse complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and all other applicable laws and regulations concerning children and the Internet. We do not disclose any Personal Information about children under 18 years of age who have registered on the Site to third parties, or share or disclose Personal Information other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy; provided however, that in the event of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or similar transaction, management of our customer information may be transferred to our successor or assign.

**9\. Links and Third Party Services.** If you click on a link to a third party site, including on an advertisement, you will leave the Site and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your Personal Information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as En Masse. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to the Site, you should consult that site's privacy policy before providing any Personal Information.

**10\. Accessing or Changing Personal Information.** To review and update your Personal Information stored with En Masse, please access your account. 

**11\. Security of Personal Information.** En Masse follows generally accepted industry standards to protect Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on the Site, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer (SSL) technology. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is completely secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**12\. Information for People Outside the United States.** By accepting this Privacy Policy, you confirm your command and knowledge of English is sufficient to understand the terms and conditions set forth herein. For persons in European Union countries, as used herein, terms such as "Personal Information" refer to "personal data" as defined by the Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data ("Directive"). We will not collect any personal data from you unless you provide it voluntarily. By using the Site, you agree that we may transfer your personal data outside the European Union in connection with the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. Your personal data may be transferred to the United States, and/or other non-EU jurisdictions, as applicable.

**13\. Other Agreements That Govern Your Use of The Site.** In addition to this Privacy Policy, your rights and obligations concerning the use of the Site are governed by our Terms of Service, any end user license agreement, any other supplemental agreements, and other applicable policies, guidelines, and requirements. When you sign up to use the Site, please review each such agreement carefully, as you must agree to be bound by each such agreement before you may use the service.

**14\. Notice of Changes to the Privacy Policy.** By using the Site, you signify your assent to En Masse's Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy, and may attempt to notify you by email, pop-up screen, or by means of a notice somewhere else on the Site. Your continued use of the Site will signify your acceptance of the changes to our Privacy Policy.
