# The Territory Ahead

  
**We Respect Your Privacy**  
It is customary for direct marketing companies like The Territory Ahead/Isabella Bird to share customer information (name and address) with other reputable firms for purposes of sending you relevant catalog, magazine, or fundraising offers in the mail. You have the right to choose not to receive such information from other direct marketing firms. Furthermore, you may want to know what information we collect online from customer transactions and how we use it. Our privacy policy below explains our name removal procedure ("opt out"), data collection practices, and other pertinent security information.

  
(Updated October 10, 2005) The Territory Ahead, Inc. sells apparel and accessories under The Territory Ahead and Isabella Bird brand names through its own catalogs, online web sites (territoryahead.com; isabellabird.com), via HSN TV, HSN.com, and our retail stores. We share our customer list (excluding customers of HSN TV, HSN.com, and our retail stores) with carefully screened companies whose products and services may interest you. Individual information shared consists of name and address; aggregate information shared may include range of dollars spent, date range of transaction, and type of clothing purchased (e.g., men’s versus women’s clothing). We do not share customer telephone number or email address with outside companies. Our list is not available for telemarketing.

  
If you do not wish to receive mailings from these other companies with whom we share customer lists, or do not wish to receive our catalogs, please contact us by phone, email, or mail. Provide your exact name and address as it appears on your catalog to ensure accuracy, and indicate your catalog preferences.

  
Transaction information and email addresses We collect only the minimum information necessary to complete your order online; this is the same information required to complete telephone orders — name, billing and shipping address, telephone number, and payment information. We require customer email address for online orders so that we may notify you of your order status or merchandise return status. Additionally, we may send you emails promoting our products, announcing periodic sales, and offering other special limited-time discounts such as free shipping that may be used by online customers.

  
We do not share customer email addresses with other companies for direct marketing purposes. However, if you do not wish to receive promotional mailings from territoryahead.com or isabellabird.com, you will have the option to opt out upon receipt of your next promotional email, or [you can unsubscribe here.](https://web.archive.org/subscribemain.jsp?action=0)
