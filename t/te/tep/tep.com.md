### TEP Internet Privacy Policy

_Privacy Commitment._  
Tucson Electric Power Company ("TEP") is committed to protecting the privacy of its customers. As TEP strives to offer its customers new products and services, TEP remains sensitive to privacy issues, including those associated with the Internet. This Privacy Policy, which reaffirms TEP's commitment to maintaining customer privacy, discloses the privacy practices governing this web site, including how TEP collects, protects, and uses Customer Information. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, "Customer Information" means any information gathered by TEP about an identified individual, including, but not limited to, e-mail address, name, street address, telephone number, Social Security number, transactional information based on your activity on the site, and credit card and bank account information. Customer Information does not include information that is publicly available. 

_Scope of Policy._  
This Privacy Policy applies to all users of this web site ("Users"). By accessing the web site, the User consents to this Privacy Policy and to the collection and use of information by TEP as specified herein. This Privacy Policy is subject to the TEP web site [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/web/20070818021622id_/http%3A//www.tep.com/Company/termsofservice.asp) which take precedence over any conflicting terms contained herein. Except as otherwise provided in the [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/web/20070818021622id_/http%3A//www.tep.com/Company/termsofservice.asp), this Privacy Policy is the entire privacy policy for this web site and supersedes any prior communication on this topic. 

_Collection of Customer Information._  
The primary reason that TEP collects and maintains Customer Information is to provide services to its customers. As explained below, information made available to TEP falls into two general categories: (1) Customer Information voluntarily supplied, and (2) generic information recorded as Users navigate through the web site. 

> _Voluntarily Provided Customer Information._ Users of the web site may choose to provide Customer Information directly to TEP by a number of means, including through the web site services registration process. Such Customer Information is stored in a secure database and may be retrieved and changed at the User's request. The web site will remember some of this Customer Information for the next time a User logs in and uses the web site. TEP may additionally obtain Customer Information from consumer reporting agencies in order to determine a User's creditworthiness and credit history. 
> 
> _Generic Information._ When a User accesses the web site, TEP's web servers automatically record the User's Internet service provider, IP address, domain name, browser type, and operating system. This generic information does not reveal the User's identity and is used in an aggregate, non-personally identifiable form to improve the web site. 
> 
> _Cookies._ TEP uses "cookies" to improve site performance. Cookies are random alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred through a Web browser to a User's computer hard drive. Cookies enable TEP's systems to recognize the User's browser and allow the User to quickly sign in to TEP Account Manager without having to repeatedly enter e-mail account information. Most Web browsers can be set to not accept cookies, however, TEP recommends that Users leave cookies turned on to take full advantage of all of the TEP site's features.

_Use of Customer Information._   
It is TEP's general policy to treat Customer Information as confidential and use it in a limited number of ways. When a User provides Customer Information when ordering services or requesting information on the web site, TEP uses that information for the purpose for which it was provided. TEP may use Customer Information between various departments within TEP to effectively provide the services the customer desires. TEP may additionally provide such information to specific non-affiliated third parties who are providing services for the benefit of the customer on behalf of or jointly with TEP. Except as expressly set forth herein, TEP does not sell or otherwise intentionally disclose Customer Information obtained on-line to non-TEP entities unless the customer specifically authorizes such disclosure, it is required by law, or it is necessary to protect the safety of TEP's customers, employees or property. If a User desires to remain completely anonymous, the User may take advantage of the publicly available content on the web site without registration. TEP reserves the right to transfer all such Customer Information in connection with the sale of all or part of TEP's capital stock or assets.

_Retention of Customer Information._   
Subject to limits imposed by applicable law, TEP retains Customer Information as long as it believes such information will be useful. TEP reserves the right to eventually remove any such Customer Information from TEP's records.

_Security._  
TEP maintains reasonable electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect Customer Information from loss, unauthorized access and disclosure. Although TEP believes these procedures are adequate, no method of storing or transmitting information over the Internet, including email communications, is completely secure. Accordingly, TEP cannot guaranty or warrant the absolute performance of such safeguards. If a User does not want TEP to know any particular Customer Information, the User should not include it in anything submitted to this web site. 

In using certain services offered on this web site, a User may be assigned a user ID and password. The User is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of his/her user ID and password, and is responsible for all activities that occur under his/her user ID and password. Each User agrees to immediately notify TEP of any unauthorized use of his/her user ID, password or Customer Information, or any other breach of security regarding the web site. TEP will not be liable for any loss arising from a User's failure to comply with these security requirements and each User agrees to hold TEP harmless from any and all losses that arise from any such failure to comply.

TEP is not responsible for any information, including Customer Information, which may be gathered at a linked or other third-party site. Although TEP has taken precautions to ensure that linked sites follow a similar privacy policy, TEP cannot guarantee their policy or practices and urges Users to review the individual policies of each site they visit. In no event will TEP be responsible for any third-party web site policies or actions.

_Changes to Policy_  
TEP is continuously working to improve its Privacy Policy to remain in compliance with evolving laws pertaining to the Internet and customer privacy. TEP accordingly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify the Privacy Policy from time to time. Any such change will be effective upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy at the web site. If such changes are made, TEP will revise the "Last Updated" date on the top of the Privacy Policy. By continuing to use the web site after the posting of any such changes, you accept and agree to the Privacy Policy, as modified.

_Compliance with Laws._  
TEP will comply with applicable federal and state laws regarding its collection and use of your Customer Information and will limit any disclosures accordingly.

TEP does not knowingly collect nor does TEP desire to collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen without verifiable parental consent.
