# TeenSpot.com - Privacy Policy

We may use Personally Identifiable Information subject to the terms of this privacy policy.  We will never sell, trade, or lease your e-mail address to any unauthorized third party. From time to time you may receive e-mail sent by us that details special offers or other valuable information about our partners or business colleagues.

**How we gather information from users**

How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided to you.  You may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. Like most websites, we also collect information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent or invisible to our users. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, keeping you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means and there may be other technologies present that act in a similar way but are protected by confidentiality in that they are valuable intellectual properties. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, such as by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize TeenSpot.com's features according to your preferences. If you do not accept cookies you will find your enjoyment of TeenSpot.com as well as the Internet to be lessened considerably.

**What we do with the information we collect**

We collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising.  We respect your privacy and do not share your personal information with anyone.

Aggregated Data (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive).  Aggregated Data may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.

We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected by us to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Use and privacy policy; services and products offered by us and other topics we think you might find of interest including commercial announcements of various nature.

Personally Identifiable Information collected by us may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration and development, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Internet hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law and/or law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide notice prior to disclosure in such cases.

**Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements**

We expect our partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users.  Be aware, however, that third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.  For example, during your visit to our site you may link to certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through our content you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, websites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. We are not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party. Please make sure you are aware of when you leave our site or view content through a frame.

While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features available on our site may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information. We do not control the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.

You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond our control and outside the scope of this document.

**Minors**

We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from or about minors under 13 except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from a minor under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. TeenSpot.com is designed to be of service and interest to minors, specifically, to teenagers.  If you are a minor, you may only use TeenSpot.com with the permission and under the supervision of your parent or guardian.  Parents should never allow their minors to use the Internet without directly supervising them.

**Changes to this Policy**

We reserve the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site following the posting of changes to these terms will constitute acceptance of those changes.  Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information was collected.

**Governing law**

This policy and any interpretation thereof is subject to the laws of the State of Washington. If a dispute arises under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it with the help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in Spokane , Washington. Any costs and fees other than attorney fees associated with the mediation will be shared equally by each of us.

If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution through mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration to be held at our offices or at any location mutually agreed upon by all parties under the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitration may be entered in any court with jurisdiction to do so. You must be present at all mediation meetings. We will mutually agree to a mediator, and if we cannot do so, then you agree that the American Arbitration Association may appoint a mediator.

This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.
