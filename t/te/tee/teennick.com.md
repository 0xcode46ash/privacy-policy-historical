# Privacy Policy/Your California Privacy Rights | TeenNick

**Privacy Policy/Your California Privacy Rights**

TeenNick.com is a site where people can come to play games, answer polls, and have their opinions heard. It's also the spot to find out more about the shows on TeenNick, and about the stuff that happens in those shows.

At TeenNick.com, your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the collection and use of the personally identifiable information we collect at our site. This privacy notice applies only to personally identifiable information collected at www.TeenNick.com and does not cover, unless otherwise specifically stated, any information collected by any other Web site or offline.

**Information Collection**

To fulfill your requests for information, enable you to participate in our site offerings, and to provide you with opportunities to learn about other products and services in which we think you might be interested, we may ask that you provide us with certain personally identifiable information during the registration process. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at this site include: name, address, e-mail address, phone number, credit card or other payment information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services. TeenNick.com is committed to complying fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. We urge kids and teens to check with their parents before entering information on any website. 

_Non-personally identifiable information_  
We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of our Web pages, such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, FireFox), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows or Mac OS), and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online or Earthlink).

**Use of Collected Information**

We use your personally identifiable information to provide the information or content you have requested (e.g., newsletters, show updates, entering you into a contest, sweepstakes or promotion, registration for our message boards), to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, and to offer you special offers and promotions from businesses within the Nickelodeon and MTV Networks family of companies, and on behalf of selected third parties offering products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We may also use your personally identifiable information to contact you regarding your use of our Web site or changes to our privacy notice, [Terms of Use](http://www.teennick.com/footerPage.php?id=52), or other policies or terms that affect you and your use of our Web site or for other purposes disclosed at the time of collection. In addition, we may use information collected about our users to improve the content and navigation of our Web site, or for other internal purposes. 

From time to time, we may combine the information we collect online with information available from other sources, including information received from promotional partners or other third parties.

Agents and contractors of TeenNick.com who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this privacy notice by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us. 

In addition, with your permission, we may share personally identifiable information with unrelated third parties to enable them to provide you with opportunities to learn of products or services in which you may be interested.

We may disclose anonymous, aggregated user statistics to third parties for a variety of purposes. For example, we may disclose how many individuals visited certain areas of our Web site, or demographic information about our users. In addition, we may disclose personally identifiable information collected about you at this site in the following instances: 

_• Legal Action:_ We may disclose information about our users, including personally identifiable information, when legally required to do so, at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Web site and applicable laws, or to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Web site. We also may disclose user information whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to limit our legal liability; to protect or defend our rights or property; or protect the safety, rights, or property of our users.

_• Corporate Change:_ We may sell, transfer, or otherwise disclose user information, including personally identifiable information, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, the sale of substantially all assets, or other corporate change respecting the Web site. 

The information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We may use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities. In addition, when you post a message on our message boards, you have the ability to post a message that may include personally identifiable information about yourself. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. If you choose to submit content for publication we may publish your screen name and other information you have provided to us. 

**Your Choices**

As noted above, we may use the personally identifiable information we collect from you online to provide you with opportunities to offer you products and services that may be of interest to you. If, at any time in the future, you wish to opt out of future promotional materials from us log back into your profile using your user name and password and edit your preferences accordingly or you may follow the unsubscribe instructions that appear at the end of our communications.

With your permission, we also may, from time to time, share personally identifiable information with unrelated third parties whose practices are not covered by this notice to enable them to provide you with additional opportunities to learn about products or services in which we believe you may be interested. If you would like to request that we not share your information with these third parties, please log back into your profile using your user name and password and edit your preferences accordingly.

**Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors**

Some of our Web pages contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

We may sometimes offer content (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, or promotions) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity. We have no control over these third parties' use of this information. We will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such information.

We use a reputable third party to present or serve the advertisements that you may see at our Web pages. Our privacy notice does not cover any use of information that a third-party ad server may have collected from you.

**Cookies & Log Data**

Unique identifiers such as cookies (which may be html files, Flash files, or other technology), web beacons, or similar technologies (collectively referred to as "Tracking Technologies") are used to help tailor our content, allow users to move between associated websites without logging into each site, and other purposes related to our management of TeenNick.com. Cookies are small text files stored locally on your machine that help store user preferences. "Web beacons" or "clear gifs" are small pieces of code placed on websites used to collect advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses. 

We may use Tracking Technologies to understand site and Internet usage and to improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements on our site. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience on TeenNick.com (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to a site), save your password in password-protected areas, save your online game or video player settings, and enable you to use shopping carts on TeenNick.com. We also may use cookies to help us offer you products, programs, or services that may be of interest to you and to deliver relevant advertising. By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you are consenting to the use of Tracking Technologies as set forth in this Policy.   
In many internet browsers, you can choose to delete, disable, turn off or reject most Tracking Technologies through the "Internet Options" sub-option of the "Tools" menu option of your browser or otherwise as directed by your browser’s support feature. Additional information on deleting, disabling, rejecting or turning off Tracking Technologies may be available through your browser’s support feature.

Please know that certain areas and features of our TeenNick.com only can be accessed in conjunction with cookies or similar devices and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar devices might prevent you from accessing some of our content. 

This Site may additionally use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, "Third Party Advertising Service Providers") to, for example, serve advertisements on TeenNick.com, facilitate targeting of advertisements and/or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on TeenNick.com ("Targeting Services"). These Third Party Advertising Service Providers may enable us to display advertisements based on your visits to TeenNick.com and other websites you have visited. Targeting Services enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements or other content to you for products and services that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. 

Although these Third Party Advertising Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by TeenNick.com, the Third Party Advertising Service Providers, as well as advertisers, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies and/or they may otherwise have access to information about you.

You should be aware that different rules might apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your information by third parties in connection with their advertisements, promotions and other websites you encounter on the Internet. The use of such technology by these third parties is within their control and not ours. Even if we have a relationship with the third party, we do not control those sites or their policies and practices regarding your information. This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that a Third Party Advertising Service Providers or advertiser may collect from you. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions directly of them in this regard. Use of a third party’s Tracking Technology is subject to their own privacy policies. For more information about these third party servers and how to "opt out" of the ad-serving cookie, please click [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp)

Log data collected on web servers supplies us with aggregate information about the number of visits to different pages on our Site. The Site uses such aggregate information to improve access to our content based on our visitors' browsers and operating system types to make our content available to as many users as possible. We do not link the "log data" collected to personally identifiable information submitted by users when participating in our activities. Third Party Advertising Service Providers may also collect aggregate log data independently from TeenNick.com.
