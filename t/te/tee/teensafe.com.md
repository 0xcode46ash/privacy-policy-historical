The Teen Arrive Alive Privacy Policy describes the information we collect about you and how we use and disclose the information. The **Teen Arrive Alive Privacy Policy may also be called the Teen Arrive Alive Privacy Notice. By accessing our website, you accept the practices we describe in this Privacy Policy.**

**Children Under Age 13**

Teen Arrive Alive’s products and services are directed to teenagers and their parents or legal guardians. Teen Arrive Alive does not knowingly sell products or services to any person under the age of 13. Teen Arrive Alive does not knowingly collect information about any person under the age of 13.

**Information We Collect And How We Use It**

  * Information We Need To Provide TAA’s Services: To provide TAA’s services, we need to collect personal, identifiable information about the Subscriber, about the Teen and about any person (Third-Party Contact) whom the Subscriber designates as eligible to receive reports from TAA about the Teen. This information includes, but is not limited to, the following: first and last name, shipping, mailing and/or billing address, credit card or banking account number, telephone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, vehicle-related information and, on occasion, social security numbers. TAA also collects motorists’ reports about the Teen’s driving behavior.



If you subscribe to any TAA GPS (Global Positioning System) related service, TAA may also collect information about the speed, direction and location of any GPS-enabled cellular telephones assigned to the account. 

TAA uses the information collected to provide you with the Teen Arrive Alive Welcome Kit, for billing, collecting payments, reporting to the Subscriber or to a Third-Party Contact about the Teen, informing the Subscriber or the Teen about products and promotions, troubleshooting service problems, improving services, personalizing the content and advertising that you see on the TAA website, to contact you and in any other way necessary to provide TAA services. TAA may also use this information to contact the Subscriber or the Teen about products, services or promotions offered by TAA or by one or more of TAA’s corporate sponsors, affiliates or rewards partners.

  * Information About Your Visit To Our website: Each time you visit our website, we automatically collect information about you. This information is used for aggregate purposes and will not be personally identifiable. This information includes your IP (Internet Protocol) address, web pages visited, length of visits, frequency with which you visit various parts of our website, Subscriber or Teen feedback and Subscriber or Teen survey responses. 



TAA uses this information to understand how our subscribers as a group use our service and to improve TAA services. TAA may also share statistical information with corporate sponsors, affiliates, rewards partners or other outside companies, but except for information that we share with Third Party Contacts and Rewards Partners which we have described in this Privacy Policy, **we will not disclose personal identifiable information to third parties**.

  * Information About Your Contacts With TAA: Whenever you contact TAA – whether by email or by telephone, we keep a record of the contact. For telephone contacts, we typically record the date and time of the call, the name of the caller and the reason for the call. Additionally, we may record telephone calls for training and quality control purposes. If you subscribe to any TAA services, or request changes to an existing service, we may record that information as well. We may store the record of your contacts with TAA in accordance with the Teen Arrive Alive Records Retention Policy.



TAA uses this information as necessary to provide customer service.

**How We Share Information**

  * To TAA’s Service Providers: TAA relies on a variety of service providers. For example, one TAA service provider creates and stores speed, direction and location information about the GPS-enabled cellular telephone assigned to the Teen, while another service provider responds to customer service and sales inquiries made by telephone. TAA may share any information it collects with its service providers. These service providers are required by contract to maintain the confidentiality of any information TAA shares with them. 


  * To TAA Reward Partners: TAA offers exciting rewards to Teens who participate in the program and especially to those who consistently exhibit safe driving behavior. To help TAA’s Reward Partners make these offerings, TAA may share personal information about the Teen that is reasonably necessary for the Teen to participate in the Rewards Program. The Reward Partners may use this information to contact the Teen about reward winnings. 



If the Subscriber or the Teen does not want the Teen to participate in TAA’s Rewards Program, please visit the TAA website at [www.teenarrivealive.com](http://www.teenarrivealive.com/), click on TAA Account Manager, make the appropriate election in your account profile (My Teens/Personal) and TAA will not share information we collect about the Teen with our Rewards Partners. This selection can be changed at any time by visiting the TAA website and changing the election in your account profile.

  * To TAA’s Corporate Sponsors or Affiliates. TAA has a wide range of corporate sponsors and affiliates. TAA may aggregate and share Subscriber or Teen information with corporate sponsors or affiliates. The information shared with corporate sponsors or affiliates is not individually identifiable. 


  * In Business Transactions. TAA may acquire other businesses and other businesses may acquire TAA. If that occurs, the information TAA collects may be one of the assets examined or transferred as part of the transaction. TAA will not permit another business to examine the information TAA has collected without a confidentiality agreement. TAA will not transfer the information it has collected unless the recipient agrees to provide privacy protections equal to or exceeding those established by this Privacy Policy.


  * In Legal Proceedings And To Protect Safety. If TAA receives legal process calling for the production of information (such as a court order, a subpoena, a civil discovery request or an investigative demand), TAA will produce information that responds to the legal process. TAA may disclose information to the extent necessary for TAA to protect its own rights, property or safety.
