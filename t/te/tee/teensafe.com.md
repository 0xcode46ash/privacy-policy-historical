## TeenSafe, Inc. Privacy Policy

Last Modified on June 5, 2014 

**_Our Privacy Commitment_**   


TeenSafe, Inc. ("TeenSafe," "we," "us" or "our") is committed to respecting the privacy rights and concerns of all users of the TeenSafe website where this Privacy Policy is posted (the "Site") (we refer to the Site, the services and the software made available through the Site, collectively, as the "TeenSafe Features"). As such, we have established and implemented this Privacy Policy to inform visitors to the Site and users of the TeenSafe Features how we use and protect the information we collect through the Site and the TeenSafe Features. By visiting the Site or using any of the TeenSafe Features, you consent to TeenSafe's collection, use, storage, deletion and disclosure of information relating to you as set forth in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date set forth above and is only applicable to the Site and not to any other website that you may be able to access from the Site which may have its own data collection and use practices and policies.   


  
This policy answers the following questions: 

  * What information do we collect about you and how do we use it? 
  * Will we share your Personal Information with third parties? 
  * What choices do you have about the collection and use of your Personal Information? 
  * What security measures do we take to safeguard your Personal Information? 



**_What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?_**

**Types of Information We Collect**

Personal information means information that can be used to identify and contact an individual such as name, email address, screen name, mailing address and phone number (the "Personal Information"). You need to submit Personal Information to access the Site and the TeenSafe Features. 

We collect Personal Information when you create an account through the TeenSafe Features; subscribe to our newsletter; participate in feedback forms and questionnaires; or receive customer or technical support. 

To create an account for the TeenSafe Features, we require you to provide certain information to create your profile, including a login name and password and your email address, mailing address and phone number. Providing additional information beyond what is required to create an account is entirely optional, but enables you to gain more from the TeenSafe Features. If you sign up for one of our services which involves tracking mobile and Internet activities, we may also collect information from other internet sources and database services. No information of this type will be collected unless you have registered for services that require it. 

We do not access, use, or share any information obtained by our servers through your use of the TeenSafe Features. 

**How We Use Your Personal Information**

The Personal Information you provide to us will allow us to provide the services available through the Site and the TeenSafe Features; alert you of new products or services, features, or enhancements; handle/route your customer service questions or issues; and/or notify you of upgrade opportunities, or special offers. We also use your email address as part of the TeenSafe Features in sending you messages about the TeenSafe Features and other general announcements. 

We keep track of your interactions with us, including but not limited to your activity within the TeenSafe Features. We may use Personal Information you provide to us to send messages to you in response to your request to perform an activity in connection with your use of any of the TeenSafe Features. We may also use your Personal Information to contact you when necessary. 

We may use your Personal Information with non-personal information that we have collected in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the TeenSafe Features. We may make your Personal Information non-personally identifiable by either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your Personal Information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable. This process is known as de-personalizing your information. You grant us a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your Personal Information in connection with the creation and development of analytical and statistical analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data we collect in providing the TeenSafe Features (the "Analytical Data"). We are expressly authorized to make any commercial use of the Analytical Data, including without limitation, sharing the Analytical Data with third parties, provided that we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer from us any part of the Analytical Data that personally identifies any TeenSafe Features users. 

**Cookies and other Tracking Technologies**

"Cookies" are small bits of electronic information that a website sends to a visitor's browser and are stored on the visitor's hard drive. Like many websites, we employ cookies in certain areas of the Site to allow us to provide information to make your online experience more convenient. For example, when you return to our Site after logging in, cookies provide information to the Site so that the Site will remember who you are on subsequent visits, speeding up or enhancing your experience of the services offered by, for instance, tailoring content to you. 

"Web beacons" (also known as internet tags, single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, and invisible GIFs) are tiny graphics on a web page or in an e-mail message that are used to track pages viewed or messages opened. Web beacons tell the web site server information such as the IP address and browser type related to the visitor's computer. Like many websites, we employ Web beacons in online advertisements that bring people to our Site and on different pages of our Site. Web beacons provide us with information on how many times a page is opened and which information is consulted. 

In addition, like most advertisers, we place advertisements where we think they will be most relevant to customers. One way we do so is by allowing network advertising companies with whom we work to place their own cookies when an individual visits our Site. This enables the network advertising company to recognize individuals who have previously visited the Site. When the individual visits a third-party web site on which that network advertising company has purchased ad space, the advertising company can then recognize the individual's interest in TeenSafe and deliver one of our advertisements. 

**Log Information**

Our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit the Site. This information includes your Internet Protocol address, your browser type and version, the search engine you used to find the TeenSafe Features, if any, which TeenSafe Features you use and when and how long you use them. We use this information to monitor and analyze how users use the TeenSafe Features, to provide customer service and to maintain and improve the TeenSafe Features. 

**Children's Privacy**

You must be at least 18 years old to obtain an account on this site. 

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children or sell any products to children. We take children's privacy seriously, and encourage the legal guardians of children to play an active role in their children's online experience at all times. TeenSafe provides you, as a legal guardian of a child or children under the age of 18, with the ability to collect certain information of your children by providing you access to certain cell phone and computer activities (including, but not limited to, email, text messages and the activities on social networking sites and applications, such as Facebook and Instagram) of your children using computers and/or mobile devices on which certain software provided through the TeenSafe Features is installed by you. 

  
While TeenSafe grants you access to information through the TeenSafe Features from the computers and/or mobile devices of your children, TeenSafe has no access to, nor does TeenSafe use in any way, the information you access through the TeenSafe Features. You are solely responsible for such information accessed by you or any permitted third party using the TeenSafe Features and you agree to the Representations and Warranties of the Terms of Use governing the use of the Site and the TeenSafe Features. 

**_Will we share your Personal Information with third parties?_**

**Sharing of Information**

We do not access, use, or share any information obtained by our servers through your use of the TeenSafe Features. We may use your Personal Information to provide analyses of our users in the aggregate (including Analytical Data subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy) to prospective partners and other third parties. To the extent we share Personal Information that has not been de-personalized with third parties, we require those third parties to comply with this Privacy Policy and take appropriate confidentiality and security measures. 

In addition, we will share the Personal Information we collect from you under the following circumstances: 

  * **Protection of rights.** We will share your Personal Information if we have a good faith belief that (i) access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, such as a court order or subpoena, or a request by law enforcement or governmental authorities, (ii) such action is appropriate to enforce the [Terms of Use](https://cp.teensafe.com/helps/terms) for the TeenSafe Features, including any investigation of potential violations thereof, (iii) such action is necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues associated with the TeenSafe Features, or (iv) such action is appropriate to protect the rights, property or safety of TeenSafe, its employees, users of the TeenSafe Features or others. 
  * **Asset transfers.** If we become involved in a merger, acquisition or other transaction involving the sale of some or all of TeenSafe's assets, user information, including Personal Information collected from you through your use of the TeenSafe Features, could be included in the transferred assets. You expressly consent to such transfer. Should such an event occur, we will use reasonable means to notify you, either through email and/or a prominent notice on the Site. 
  * **Service Providers.** We may share your Personal Information with service providers that we engage for the purpose of processing information on our and your behalf. For example, we may partner with other companies to process, analyze, and/or store data, including, but not limited to, Analytical Data. While providing services for us, these companies may access your Personal Information. To the extent applicable, we require these entities to comply with this Privacy Policy and appropriate confidentiality and security measures. 



**Additional Information You Should Know About Third Parties**   
This Privacy Policy does not cover and expressly excludes the information practices of third party websites linked to the Site. Although we encourage such third parties to adopt and follow their own privacy policies, we are not responsible for their collection and use of your Personal Information. You should refer to the privacy policies and statements of other websites or contact the respective webmasters of those websites to obtain information regarding their information collection, use and disclosure policies. 

When you have clicked on a third party logo or URL displayed on our Site which links you to a different website, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the third party to see how your Personal Information will be handled on their website. 

**_What choices do you have about the collection and use of your Personal Information?_**

**Control of Your Information**

You may access, update or delete your Personal Information or modify your account preferences for the TeenSafe Features by accessing the "Settings" area of the TeenSafe Platform. Please note that when you delete your account, we may retain your account information for a reasonable period of time afterward for the purpose of internal account management and fraud prevention activities. 

**Opting Out of Receiving Communications from Us**

If you no longer want to receive our newsletter, emails or other announcements, you may unsubscribe by selecting "Unsubscribe" in your account, writing to us at [privacy@teensafe.com](mailto:privacy@teensafe.com) or replying to the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our emails. Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from certain correspondence from us, including messages relating to your account transactions. 

**Mediation**

You agree that, in the event any dispute or claim arises out of or relating to this Privacy Policy that you and TeenSafe will attempt in good faith to negotiate a written resolution of the matter directly between the parties. If you reside in the Unied States, you agree that if the matter remains unresolved for forty-five (45) days after notification (via certified mail or personal delivery) that a dispute exists, all parties shall join in mediation services in Orange County, California with a mutually agreed mediator in an attempt to resolve the dispute. Should you file any arbitration claims, or any administrative or legal actions without first having attempted to resolve the matter by mediation, then you agree that you will not be entitled to recover attorney's fees, even if you would otherwise be entitled to them. 

**Dispute Resolution for Residents of the European Union**

If you are a resident of the European Union, in the event that you have any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Privacy Policy, you may report your claim to the European Union Data Protection Authorities located in your jurisdiction. 

**_What security measures do we take to safeguard your Personal Information?_**

The Personal Information that you provide to us is stored on servers, which are located in secured facilities with restricted access, and protected by protocols and procedures designed to ensure the security of such information. In addition, we restrict access to Personal Information to TeenSafe employees who need to know this information in order to develop, operate and maintain the TeenSafe Features. All TeenSafe personnel who have access to this information are trained in the maintenance and security of such information. However, no server, computer or communications network or system, or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect user information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or through the use of any of the TeenSafe Features and you acknowledge and agree that you provide such information and engage in such transmissions at your own risk. Once we receive a transmission from you, we will endeavor to maintain its security on our systems.
