We automatically **track certain information** about you based upon your behaviour on our site. We use this information to do **internal research** on our users' demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand and serve our users. This information is compiled and analysed on an **aggregated basis**.

Using the Site's web server **log files** , we use IP addresses to analyze trends, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personal information. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser and operating system you are using, your IP address etc.  
In addition, **we use cookies** on certain pages of our site. We may also offer certain features that are only available through the use of a cookie. Cookies can also help us provide information which is targeted to your interests. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our site. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted at the end of a session. The other type of cookie we use is a 'persistent' cookie. This stays on your hard drive and we use this to automatically identify who you are. We use this cookie so that you do not need to log in manually every time you visit the site if you are a registered user. The cookie itself contains no personal information but it does pass an ID to our server which allows us to tie the cookie to your personal information. We do this to allow us to let you know on the homepage what has changed on the site since your last visit. We also use the cookie to track how often you visit the site so we know who our most loyal users are. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you will not be able to use certain features on our site. For example, if you disable cookies, you will need to log in manually each time you visit the site as we cannot use a cookie to remember who you are. 

Some of our business partners use cookies and other tracking technologies on our site. These are used to monitor site performance and to measure site traffic and usage. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Temando only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

#### Surveys & Contests.

Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested will include contact information (as supplied to the site during registration) and supplementary information on your professional interests, opinions and preferences (e.g. choice of software, working practices, opinions on industry issues, feedback on the Temando web site). We will use the contact information to notify winners. We will not publish winners' details on the site though on request we will provide details of any winners' name and organisation. If the survey or contest has a sponsor then we will share information given by entrants with the sponsor.

#### Payment Processing.

In order to process payments online we require the billing address for the credit card used and our external payment service provider, eWAY, requires your credit card details. For details of how your information is used, please see following section.

#### Our Use of Your Information

This is done on a secure eWAY server using SSL (secure sockets layer). In the case of a suspected fraudulent transaction, Temando may be contacted for the sole purpose of performing further checks. These details are stored securely on an eWAY PCI Compliant (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) server in order to process future payments you may make, but eWAY does not use your information for any other purpose.

For example, we will share your address with shipping companies, your credit card number with credit card processors, and other personal information with insurance, and Email service providers.  This is as necessary for the third party to provide that service.  These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for any other purpose.

#### Other Information Collectors

On the Temando site we use best endeavour to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information but we do not use encryption (such as SSL) or firewalls to further protect the information as it travels across the Internet. This is because we do not believe that, apart from the credit card information processed by eWAY, the personal information we currently collect warrants such measures and the accompanying loss of speed experienced. You should be aware that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.
