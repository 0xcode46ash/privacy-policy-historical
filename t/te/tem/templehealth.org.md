**TEMPLE UNIVERSITY HEALTH SYSTEM PRACTICES REGARDING MEDICAL INFORMATION:**

 TUHS understands that medical information about you and your health is personal.  TUHS is committed to protecting your medical information. A record is created of the care and services you receive as a TUHS patient.  This record is needed to provide you with quality care, document the provision of appropriate medical services, and seek reimbursement for those services.  This notice applies to all of the records of your care generated, or utilized, by TUHS Health Care Professionals to provide you with healthcare services. 

 The purpose of this notice is to inform you about the ways in which your personal health information may be used and disclosed. It also describes your rights and other obligations regarding the use and disclosure of your personal health information.

**_TEMPLE UNIVERSITY HEALTH SYSTEM IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO:_**

  * ensure that personal heath information is kept private;
  * provide you with this notice of our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to your personal health information; and
  * follow the terms of the notice that are currently in effect.



**_HOW TUHS MAY USE AND DISCLOSE MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU:_**

**FOR TREATMENT** – Your medical information may be used to provide you with appropriate treatment and services. The physicians, nurses, technicians, and other health care personnel involved in your care may have access to your medical records. In addition, other TUHS personnel may be required to know only certain facts concerning your medical treatment in order to provide appropriate care.  For example, a physician treating a patient for a broken leg will need to know if the patient is diabetic, or the physician may need to inform the hospital dietitian about a patient’s diabetes to provide appropriate meals. Different departments within TUHS may also need to share personal medical information in order to coordinate care such as x-rays, lab work or prescriptions. Medical information may also be disclosed to arrange appropriate medical care after discharge.

**FOR PAYMENT** – Personal health information may also be disclosed so that the treatment and services received may be billed to an insurance company or other third party payor such as Medicare. For example, personal health information may be disclosed to the patient’s insurance company in order to facilitate reimbursement.  Some insurance companies require this disclosure prior to the initiation of treatment in order to determine the extent of coverage.

**FOR HEALTH CARE OPERATIONS** – Personal health information may be disclosed to ensure that TUHS is providing quality care.  For example, medical information may be used to evaluate the performance of staff, or to educate staff. Doctors, nurses, technicians, medical students, and other TUHS personnel may utilize your medical information for educational purposes.  In such situations, every effort will be made to remove any information which may identify the patient.

**FAMILY MEMBERS OR OTHER INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN CARE** – Personal health information may be disclosed to family members or friends. Patients wishing to limit the amount of information or restrict information to certain individuals may do so by following the procedures described below.

**AS REQUIRED BY LAW** – Personal health information may be disclosed as required by federal, state, or local law. This may include mandatory reporting to public health officials, or the F.D.A. 

**ORGAN AND TISSUE DONATIONS** – If you are an organ donor, medical information may be disclosed to organizations which are involved in organ procurement as necessary to facilitate organ or tissue donations and transplantations.

**HEALTH RELATED BENEFITS AND SERVICES** – TUHS may use and disclose medical information to inform you, or recommend possible treatment options or alternatives that may be of benefit to you, or remind you of appointments.  

**CORONERS, MEDICAL EXAMINERS AND FUNERAL DIRECTORS** – Personal health information may be released to a coroner or medical examiner to, for example, determine a cause of death or identify a deceased person.

    * is not part of the information which you would be permitted to inspect and copy; or
    * the information is accurate and complete.  
 
  * _Right to an Accounting of Disclosures:_ You have the right to request an “accounting of disclosures” which is a listing of disclosures made of your medical information.  Such a request must be in writing utilizing the available form from the Medical Records (Health Information Management) Department or physician’s office of the TUHS facility which provided the service.  The time frame cannot be longer than six years, and the first request within a 12-month period will be provided at no cost.  Appropriate charges will be assessed for additional lists.
