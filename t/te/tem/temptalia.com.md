# Temptalia.com Privacy Policy

## **Privacy Policy  
**

### Overview

The privacy of our visitors to Temptalia LLC is important to us.  At Temptalia LLC, we recognize that privacy of your personally identifiable information is important. Our policy is intended to protect your privacy and keep sensitive information safeguarded while providing you with information about how and what data we collect and how it may be used.  Our Privacy Policy covers only data collected through www.temptalia.com and not any third-parties, affiliates, or sites, without limitation, and recommend that users regularly review the privacy policies of any websites they visit.

### Collection of Information

**Personally Identifiable Information**.  We collect personally identifiable information (also known as PII), like names, postal addresses, email addresses, and any other information required to fulfill an obligation to the user when voluntarily submitted by a user.  For example, mailing information is required to award giveaway prizes to winners, but this information is never used or sold for any additional purpose beyond fulfilling the prize or to respond to e-mails sent voluntarily by users such as feedback, questions, and technical support.  Personally identifiable information is used solely to address your specific request and is not sold to third parties or market researchers.  We never sell your personally identifiable information (PII) to third parties.

(a) Distribution of Personally Identifiable Information.  We may be required by law to share personally identifiable information with government agencies, law enforcement, or parties to civil or criminal lawsuits. To reveal collected user information, we require a validly issued subpoena, warrant, or court under that specifically requests the information sought (it should not be overly broad or vague) unless we have a good faith belief there is an emergency involving death or serious physical injury. All requests should comply with Rule 45 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the US SPEECH Act, 28 U.S.C. 4101 et seq. 

(b) Commitment to Data Security.  Your personally identifiable information is kept secure. Only authorized employees, agents and contractors (who have agreed to keep information secure and confidential) have access to this information. When signing up for our newsletter, we require double opt-in, and all mailing lists from this site allow you to opt out of further mailings.

(c) Children.  We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information.  **We collect non-personally identifiable information through such devices as third-party and in-house analytics, cookies, log files, and similar technologies, which may include, but is not limited to, your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider), the Web browser you used to visit the Site, the time you visited the Site, which Web pages you visited on the Site, and other anonymous Site usage data, and so forth.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to combine the various types of data that is collected.

(a) Cookies and Web Beacons.  We use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on a personal device, and this can include personal preferences such as login information, disabling aspects of the website like pop-up newsletters, to serve advertisements tailored to user’s preferences, and so forth. We also use third party advertisements and sell advertising directly in-house that may leverage non-personally identifiable information and/or cookies, like allowing a Canadian advertiser to only reach our Canadian users. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, what device you’re using, what sites you may have visited previously, or what page you were just browsing. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or for online behavioral advertising in order to show certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).

(b) Disabling Cookies.  You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as browser add-ins, plug-ins, anti-virus software and suits, and so forth.  Disabling cookies may affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts or to leverage faster browsing through caching methods. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice visit the **[NAI](http://www.networkadvertising.org/)**. To opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit **<http://www.aboutads.info/choices>**.  Please note, if you use multiple devices and/or browsers, you will need to disable cookies across all of them.
