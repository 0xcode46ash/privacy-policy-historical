3\. Information TenMarks collects directly from a student

TenMarks collects information directly from a student, over the Internet, in the form of the interactions that a studentmakes when participating in the Programs. We refer to the data resulting from such participation, which includes but is not limited to data on when a studentstarts and stops a lesson, the responses a studentmakes to questions asked, the timing of a student's student, a student's choice of character and customizations, and the choice of lessons to play as "Performance Data." We will use Performance Data to (1) measure a student's performance in each lesson of the TenMarks Programs and to adapt the Programs to his or her education needs, (2) analyze a student's Performance Data, and provide the studentand the associated parent/educatorwith periodic progress reports about a student's performance in the Programs, and (3) improve the Programs. If we ever need to collect information that is not Performance Data directly from a student, TenMarks will seek your authorization prior to collecting such additional information from a student. In addition, we may aggregate a student's Performance Data with the Performance Data of other studentsparticipating in the Programs for marketing and other business related purposes. Aggregate information will be ANONYMOUS and will not identify a student. 

4\. Opting-out of providing the information we request

Because the TenMarks Programs are individualized and customized for each student, all the information we request from you and studentsare required for you and a studentto participate in the Programs, with the exception of certain information to be used for our marketing purposes to you only. At any time, you may revoke your consent to allowing a studentto participate in the TenMarks Programs or refuse to allow TenMarks to further use or collect a student's personal information. Any ANONYMOUS performance data will be retained, but we will no longer use any identifiable information regarding you or a studentthat you have provided.

TenMarks will never knowingly request personally identifiable information or private content from anyone under the age of 13 without parental or educator consent.

If you are a parent, legal guardian, or educator of a user under 13 you may, at any time, revoke your consent to allow a student to use the Programs under your subscription, refuse to allow TenMarks to further use or collect a student's personal information, or direct TenMarks to delete all identifiable information regarding a student that you have provided.

13\. The Children's Internet Protection Act

The Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) is a federal law enacted by Congress in December 2000 to address concerns about access to offensive content over the Internet on school and library computers. CIPA imposes certain types of requirements on any school or library that receives funding support for Internet access or internal connections from the "E-rate" program - a program that makes certain technology more affordable for eligible schools and libraries. Our Programs do not provide links to external resources or chat rooms, and do not contain any offensive or inappropriate matter. As a result, any school or library that uses TenMarks Programs will be fully compliant with CIPA. If you would like more information about CIPA, please go to [http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/cipa.html.](http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/cipa.html)

14\. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education. FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's education records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. 

TenMarks is fully compliant with FERPA. Specifically: 

  * Any sensitive online information is transmitted over secure channels.
  * All student data are stored in ways that are not publicly accessible.
  * Security audits are regularly performed to ensure data integrity.



TenMarks does not share student information with any third parties. If a school requests that student data should be sent to a third party, with parental consent, TenMarks would send the data to the school and never directly to the third party. If you would like more information about FERPA, please go to [http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html.](http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html)
