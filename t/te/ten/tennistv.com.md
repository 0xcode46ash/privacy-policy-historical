We reserve the right to change the terms of this Privacy Policy from time to time.  


1\. What information do we hold about you and how is it collected?

  
When you register on this Site, some personal information (including your name and email addresses) is collected by us. You may also be asked for your personal information at other times on this Site - in connection with activities such as competitions, chat and voting. In common with many other online services, we may use "cookies" to store and track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data sent from the server and stored on your PC's hard drive. Most web browsers are automatically set up to accept cookies, but you can set your browser to refuse cookies or ask your browser to show you where a cookie has been set up. Certain services are only activated by the presence of a cookie and, if you choose to refuse cookies, particular features of this Site may not be available to you.

  
2\. What do we do with your personal information?

  
We will combine the different types of data to create a membership profile for you. This helps us to provide you with a more personalised service which is tailored to suit your needs. The more  
information we have, the better the service we can provide.

  
Your personal information may be disclosed by us to the ATP or WTA or other reputable suppliers selected by us from time to time. It will be used for the following purposes:

  
(i) to update and develop records and for assessment and analysis including market and service/product analysis;

(ii) to assist in the provision of services/products to you; and

(iii) to facilitate reviews, developments and improvements to the services/products offered to you.

  
3\. What do we do with your financial information?

  
We will use your financial information to enable payment authorisation and billing for products and services. When you make a purchase on this Site, your consent is given to provide your financial information and personal information to those third parties necessary to process your transactions with us, such as credit card companies, banks and companies that handle delivery and shipping on our behalf. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk protection.

  
We will not share your financial information with third parties without your consent for any other reason.

  
4\. What are your choices?

  
By law, you are entitled to:

(i) object to your personal information being used for marketing purposes. We give you the choice to opt-in to our using, or supplying your personal information to TennisTV.com or to other reputable suppliers for these purposes. You can do this during the registration process by simply ticking the box provided.   
(ii) receive, upon payment of a fee, a copy of any personal information about you which is held by us.  
(iii) require the rectification, erasure or blocking of any of your personal information which is inaccurate or not up to date held by us.

  
If you wish to exercise any of these rights, or if you wish to opt-out of any future processing of your personal information held by us, then please contact [customerservices@performgroup.com](mailto:customerservices@performgroup.com) stating your full name and email address and providing any other relevant information.

  
5\. When does this Privacy Policy not apply?

  
This Privacy Policy only applies to the collection of data by us and the use of that data by us and those we authorise. It does not cover third party sites to which we provide links, nor does it cover advertisers and content partners within our service who may also collect your personal information. They may have their own privacy policies and/or terms and conditions of use.

  
If you choose to place your personal details on any publicly accessible page (for example, on Cover it Live), then this data will not be covered by the Privacy Policy.

  
6\. How do we protect your information?

  
TennisTV.com is firmly committed to data security. When you place orders or access your account information, we offer use of a secure server. The secure server software encrypts all information before it is sent to us. We take steps to guard against unauthorised access to customer data. Although we make every effort to create a secure environment for your personal information, we cannot guarantee the safety of any personal information which you transmit to us online.
