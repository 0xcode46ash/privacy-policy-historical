This Privacy Policy covers TennisPoint's treatment of personal information that TennisPoint gathers when you are on the TennisPoint website (the �Site�) and when you use TennisPoint services (collectively the �Service�).

1\. Information You Provide to Us:  
We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The personal information we collect includes:

* We receive and store certain types of non-personally identifiable information whenever you interact with us. TennisPoint automatically receives and records certain "traffic data" on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, TennisPoint cookie information, and the page you requested.

* TennisPoint may display a counter on any page indicating the total number of times that page has been viewed. This includes member profile pages.

* Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. TennisPoint cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.

The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies , how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. You may choose to disable or reject cookies when using the Service, but you may not be able to access some of TennisPoint's most attractive features.

Some of our business partners may use cookies on our website (for example, advertisers). TennisPoint has no access to or control over these cookies.

* If you choose to provide posts from your blog via TennisPoint, we may ask you to paste confirmation code into the external template of your blog that communicates with us to authenticate the blog as an authorized feed and places a badge on your blog identifying you as a TennisPoint Affiliate.

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Once we receive your transmission of information, TennisPoint makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
