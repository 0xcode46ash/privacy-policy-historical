  * Telephone number
  * Email address



We may use a third-party payment service to process payments made through the services. If you wish to make a payment through the services, your personal information may be collected by such third party and not by us and will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy, rather than this privacy policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, this third party’s collection, use and disclosure of your personal information.

If you submit any personal information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this privacy policy.

#### HOW WE MAY COLLECT OTHER INFORMATION

<https://punchh.com/privacy_policy>We and our third party service providers may collect other information in a variety of ways, including:

  * Through your browser or device: certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your media access control (mac) address, computer type (windows or macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, internet browser type and version and the name and version of the services you are using. We use this information to ensure that the services function properly.
  * Using cookies: cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using. Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the services, pages visited, language preferences, and other anonymous traffic data. We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience while using the services. We can recognize your computer to assist your use of the services. We also gather statistical information about the usage of the services in order to continually improve the design and functionality, understand how the services are used and to assist us with resolving questions regarding the services. Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the services. We may also use cookies in online advertising to track responses to our advertisement



If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a cookie (or cookies) from a particular site. You may also wish to refer to http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html. If, however, you do not accept cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the services. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer and you may need to log in every time you visit the applicable services. You also may not receive advertising or other offers from us that are relevant to your interests and needs.

  * Using pixel tags and other similar technologies: pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear gifs) may be used in connection with some services to, among other things, track the actions of users of the services (including email recipients), measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the services and response rates.
  *  Ip address: your “ip address” is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your internet service provider (isp). An ip address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting ip addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services. We use ip addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels of the services, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the services.
  * Physical location: we may collect the physical location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower or wifi signals. We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content. We may also share your device’s physical location, combined with information about what advertisements you viewed and other information we collect, with our marketing partners to enable them to provide you with more personalized content and to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such uses and/or sharing of your device’s location, but if you choose to deny such uses and/or sharing, we and/or our marketing partners may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content. 
  * From you: information such as your preferred means of communication is collected when you voluntarily provide it. Unless combined with personal information, it does not personally identify you.
  * By aggregating information: aggregated personal information does not personally identify you (for example, we may aggregate personal information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code). 



How we may use and disclose other information we may use and disclose other information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. 

If we are required to treat other information as personal information under applicable law, then we may use it as described in the “how we may collect other information” section above, as well as for all the purposes for which we use and disclose personal information. 

In some instances, we may combine other information with personal information (such as combining your name with your geographical location). If we do, we will treat the combined information as personal information as long as it is combined.
