In certain areas of Online Service, your personal information will be searchable and viewable by anyone that accesses the Online Service. We may also publish de-personalized information and statistics of our users on an anonymous basis.

If You use Online Service, various communications within the Online Service will result in a transfer of personal information across international boundaries (as Trimble operates globally, our servers also reside in multiple locations, such as the EU, APAC and United States).

## Illegal use of Trimble software

Trimble regards software piracy (as defined in the applicable laws) as criminal offence, and we view offenders accordingly. We do not tolerate illegal copies, usage and distribution of Trimble software products, and we pursue those who do so (both civilly and criminally) using all legal means available, including public and private surveillance resources. As part of these efforts, Trimble utilizes data monitoring and sourcing technologies to the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws to obtain and transmit data on the users of illegal copies of our software. This data collection is not performed on the users of legally licensed software from Trimble and its authorized distributors.

## Protection of information

Trimble will take reasonable steps necessary to protect the information You provide to us. We continually review our security procedures and mechanisms to ensure that adequate protections are in place.
