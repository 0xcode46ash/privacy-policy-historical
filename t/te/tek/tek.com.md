#### Information Gathering and Usage

Tektronix gathers information about you from data that you provide through such things as optional or mandatory registration, online surveys, and contests. The types of personal information collected can include name, mailing address, phone number, email address, transaction and credit card information. We may also ask you to provide us with demographic information such as your job function, industry, application, contact preferences or experience with our products. Tektronix may enhance or merge your information collected on our site with other operational data as well as data from third parties for purposes of marketing products or services to you. Such information enables us to better tailor our content to your needs.

The information you provide will be used to support your professional relationship with Tektronix and our products. Among other things, we want to help you quickly find information on Tektronix, Inc. Web sites and alert you to information on our products, services and programs. We also use this information to help you complete a transaction and in some cases to contact you for market research.

##### Links to Other Sites

This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Tektronix. Links to other sites will open in a new browser window. Please be aware that Tektronix is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.

##### Message Boards/Forums

This Web site may make forums and message boards available to you. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

##### Electronic Newsletters

Tektronix offers various free electronic newsletters. Users can sign up by clicking on the "Get customized email updates" button on the homepage. We don't spam, never sell or rent email addresses, and there's an easy unsubscribe in every email you'll receive. Alternately users may remove themselves from mailing lists by sending an email to [privacy@tektronix.com](mailto:privacy@tektronix.com).

##### Contests

Tektronix offers contests in which we request certain personal information. At a minimum, the required information includes name and email address. In some cases, the entrant must answer mandatory survey questions about a range of technical interests and personal data. The information gathered in the entry form is used to verify the entrant's identity and eligibility, to contact winners or prize recipients, and to market and sell our products. Because the rules and terms of each contest can vary, all information about each contest is clearly posted during the event.

##### Forward to a Friend Feature

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. Your email address will appear as the sender of the email and we will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Both your email address and the recipient's email address will not be used for any other purpose except to facilitate the sending of this one-time email to your friend. Tektronix stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.

##### Log Files

Like most standard Web site servers, we use log files to automatically log information such as internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We log this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. For areas of our site that require registration, we log the user's email address and specific information concerning the user's activity on the site. This information may be tied to the user's other personal information and, if so, it is used to support the user's professional relationship with Tektronix and our products.

##### Mouseflow

We may periodically use the mouseflow web analytics service on the site to help us research site issues and to help us improve our visitors' experience on the site.  When enabled, Mouseflow records mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity as well as any text you type on the pages on which it is enabled.  For mouseflow's privacy policy, [visit: http://mouseflow.com/privacy](http://mouseflow.com/privacy).
