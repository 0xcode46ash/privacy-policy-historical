Tiny Prints takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. This policy covers how we treat the information that we collect and receive. Your accessing and continued use of our websites signifies your explicit consent to these terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy. We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time as our services change and expand. We will notify you of such changes by posting them on our site.

## Information Collected

Tiny Prints collects personal information when you register with Tiny Prints and when you use Tiny Prints products or services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. When you create a member account we ask for information such as your name and email address. Once you register with Tiny Prints and sign in to use our services, you are not anonymous to us.

## Cookies

Like many websites, Tiny Prints uses cookies to collect anonymous visitor information. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser. They make it possible for us to store the contents of your shopping cart until you are ready to check out, recognize your browser when you visit and provide you with information about products that interest you. By doing this, we can personalize your return visits and save you time during checkout. It is possible to prevent cookies from being used in your browser by turning the feature off, but in order to enjoy the benefits of being a registered user, your browser must be set to accept cookies.

If you utilize certain services offered by Tiny Prints, you may be required to provide Tiny Prints with personal information about others by entering that information into your address book. Any such information about others will be used by Tiny Prints solely for purposes of providing the services you specifically request. If additional information is needed to provide those services, Tiny Prints may contact those persons to obtain that additional information, and may send follow-up reminders. Tiny Prints stores that information to provide the requested services, but will never share it with outside parties. You may edit your address book at any time, and any third parties that have been entered into your address book may contact us at any time to request that we remove their information from our database.

## Use of Information

We use your personal information for the following general purposes: to fulfill your requests for products and services, to improve our services, to customize the advertising and content you see and to contact you.

We use third party personal information you provide to us solely to provide services you specifically request.

We use anonymous information, such as that pertaining to web pages you've viewed, in order to analyze trends, track user's movements, provide a better website experience and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We do not use this data in a manner that would identify you personally.

## Information Sharing

From time to time we share the personal information we collect with trusted companies who work with or on behalf of Tiny Prints. We may also combine personal information with publicly available information and information we receive from or cross-reference with our partners. These companies may use your personal information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us, to communicate with you about products and events that may be of interest to you and for other promotional purposes. Information sharing allows us to introduce new resources based on your interests and needs. With that in mind, when you purchase an item, your customer information is shared with other select companies whose products and services you may find useful.

## Information Sharing Is Your Choice

It's your information and it's your choice. We understand and respect that not all customers may want to allow us to share information with other select companies. If you do not want Tiny Prints to share your customer information, please immediately email us at [opt.out@tinyprints.com](mailto:opt.out@tinyprints.com "opt.out@tinyprints.com") and we will remove your name from lists we share with other companies after the six to eight week time period it takes to process your request. When contacting us, please clearly state your request, including your name, mailing address, email address and phone number.

Under the following circumstances, we may still be required to share your personal information:

  * If we respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, or if we need to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;
  * If we believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the Tiny Prints Terms of Use or as otherwise required by law.
  * If we transfer information about you in the event that Tiny Prints is acquired by, reorganized or merged with another company. In such an event, you will have the opportunity to ask not to receive promotional information following any such change of control.
