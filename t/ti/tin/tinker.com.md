We receive and store information you enter on Tinker.com or give to us in any other way. For example, you may provide information to Tinker.com when you register, sign-in, search, or communicate with Glam's customer service such as your name, your Twitter username and password, email address, IP address, phone number and other information that you decide to provide to us, including your photo. We require your Twitter username and password for purposes of authenticating your Twitter account information so that we can send and receive information to and from Twitter on your behalf in accordance with the Twitter API. The information we can access in your Twitter account may include content you have posted, content posted by other Twitter users that you are following, private messages sent and received to and from other Twitter users, and public profile information. We also automatically receive and store certain types of information whenever you visit Tinker.com. 

How Glam Uses Information About You

We use information we have collected about you to provide you with the services offered on the Site, as well at to communicate with you and to manage your registered account, if you have one. We use your Twitter name and password to send information to and receive information from Twitter on your behalf. **We do not sell your personal information to third parties for any reason.** We do not disclose your personal information to unaffiliated third parties who may want to offer you their own products and services unless you have requested or authorized us to do so. 

We may share your personal information with third parties or affiliates of Glam with whom we have contracted to perform services on our behalf. All companies that act on our behalf are contractually obligated to keep the personal information we provide to them confidential and to use the personal information we share only to provide the services we ask them to perform. 

We may disclose personal information about our customers as permitted or required by law, such as in connection with a subpoena or similar legal process, or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy, as discussed further below. 

Glam collects and uses personal information from you in several ways: 

•

 **Website Usage.** Glam or Glam's authorized service providers may observe activities, preferences, and transactional data (such as your IP address, browser type, and operating system) relating to your use of Tinker.com. We may use this collected or logged information in order to provide better service, to facilitate our customers' use of the website, to track usage of the website, and to address security hazards. Glam, or one of Glam's authorized service providers, may use this information to track aggregate traffic patterns throughout Tinker.com. We may use aggregated, statistical information to describe our customer audience, products and services, and to develop partnerships with third parties to offer products and services in which we believe our customers will be interested. 

•

 **Public Areas.** Any information disclosed in public areas of Tinker.com is public information that may be viewed and collected by any party. We cannot control the use of information disclosed in the public areas of our Site. You should exercise caution when disclosing information, including photos or images, in these public areas and should refrain from disclosing personally identifying information. Glam reserves the right to remove any information at any time from our site that we deem inappropriate or for any other reason. 

Our Security Practices

Our internal data security policies restrict access to customers' personal information to authorized employees. Authorized employees may use our customers' personal information for Glam business purposes only. Our employees are bound by Glam policies that require them to maintain the confidentiality of our customers' personal information. Employees who violate these requirements are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 

We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that are designed to guard our customers' personal information. For example, for the security of your online visit to Tinker.com, we may make use of firewall barriers, encryption techniques, and/or authentication procedures. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Glam cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. In the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your personal information, we will make any legally required notifications to you as necessary so you can take appropriate protective steps. Unless you indicate otherwise, we may notify you under such circumstances using the e-mail address you provided to us when you registered with Tinker.com. 

What Are Cookies and How Does Tinker.com Use Them?

We may use "cookies" to collect or log certain information. A cookie is a small piece of information that a website stores on a personal computer and which it can later retrieve. We may use cookies for some administrative purposes-for example, to better understand how you interact with the Site and its services, to monitor aggregate usage of the Site by our users and to improve the Site and its services. The cookies will not contain information that will enable anyone to contact you via telephone, e-mail, or any other means. If you are uncomfortable with the use of cookie technology, you can set your browser to refuse cookies. Certain of our services, however, could be dependent on cookies, and our customers may disable those services by refusing cookies. 

What Privacy Policies Cover the Ads on Tinker.com?

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on Tinker.com. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single-pixel GIFs or Web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is not connected to personally identifiable information, such as your name and e-mail address. 

Links to Third-Party Sites and Websites Containing Tinker.com Branding

Tinker.com may contain links to third-party sites. Please be aware, however, that Glam is not responsible for and cannot control the privacy policies of these other sites or their practices nor are links to third party sites an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We encourage you to read the privacy policies for these other sites and other statements, as they may differ from ours. 

This Site may also contain links to sites that display Tinker.com branding and/or Glam's logo but which are maintained by third parties. Such websites may be identified in that they do not display a "Tinker.com" or "Glam.com" URL. Please read the privacy policy on these sites for applicable privacy practices relating to personal information collected via those sites because they may differ from Tinker.com's privacy practices. This Privacy and Security Policy applies solely to personal information collected by Glam. 

Contact Preferences and Accessing Your Personal Information

You have choices when it comes to how Glam uses your personal information. You can choose not to receive information about merchandise, services, and special promotional offers from us. If you elect not to receive such product marketing information, Glam may continue to contact you as necessary to service your account. You can change your contact preferences at any time by following the instructions on Tinker.com. 

Keeping your account information accurate and up-to-date is very important, so we can provide you with excellent service. If your account information is incomplete, inaccurate, or not current, please follow the instructions on Tinker.com to correct your account information online. 

This Privacy and Security Policy Applies to U.S. Customers

Tinker.com is hosted in the United States and is intended for United States visitors. 

This Privacy and Security Policy applies to customer relationships established in the United States. Parts of this Privacy and Security Policy may not apply to visitors outside the United States. Like almost every website, Tinker.com may be accessed by an international audience. If you are a non-U.S. visitor to our website, by visiting our website and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be processed for the purposes identified in this Privacy and Security Policy. In addition, such data may be stored on servers located outside your resident jurisdiction, which may have less stringent privacy practices than your own. By providing us with your data, you consent to transfer of such data. 

Mergers, Acquisitions, and Bankruptcy

If Glam should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company, or if Glam should decide to buy another business or sell or reorganize part or all of Glam's business, Glam may be required to disclose your personal information to prospective or actual purchasers and other parties. It is Glam's practice to obtain appropriate protections for information disclosed in these types of transactions. Glam cannot, however, guarantee that Glam's Privacy and Security Policy will remain unchanged if Glam is sold or merges with another company. 

Tinker.com Is Not for Use by Children

Children are not eligible to use Tinker.com. We ask that minors (under the age of 18) only use Tinker.com in conjunction with your parents or guardians. Children under 13 should not send any information about themselves to Glam. If a child under 13 submits information through any part of Tinker.com, and Glam becomes aware that the person submitting the information is a child, we will attempt to delete this information as soon as possible. Because we do not knowingly collect any personal information about children under 13, we do not use or disclose such information to third parties.
