**3\. Use of Information Gathered by TimeTrade During Registration For Services or Other General Inquiries.**

When you visit TimeTrade’s Website for information regarding our products, promotions, employment opportunities or register to use TimeTrade services, TimeTrade may gather information about you such as your name, business type, contact information, email address, payment method, and billing address information. This information may be used to: a) contact you directly regarding TimeTrade services, career opportunities and/or to respond to your inquiries; or b) provide invoicing of the subscribed services.

Unless permission is provided through our Opt-in process, we will not sell, share, or rent your personal information to any third party or use your e-mail address for unsolicited mail. Any emails sent by TimeTrade will only be in connection with the provision of agreed services, products or inquiries.

**4.  ** **Sharing of Collected Information, “Opt-in”**

The SMB product offering provides an “opt-in” option for Subscribers and their associated Users to receive further information from TimeTrade and third parties. If the User or Subscriber opts-in, TimeTrade may share names and email addresses with selected partners so that such partners may contact them with offers that may be of interest to them. Users and Subscribers can opt-out of receiving such information at any time by unsubscribing to the marketing emails via the unsubscribe links presented in the email. Enterprise Subscriber data is not used or included in any TimeTrade or third party marketing programs.

**5.  ** **Credit Card Transactions**

Online credit card payments related to SMB subscriptions are processed by a PCI certified payment processing vendor utilizing secure, encrypted payment card processing methods. Financial information will not be shared with any party not directly involved with billing of the services.

**6.  ** **Use of Information by Subscribers**

The TimeTrade applications collect data in order to schedule services on behalf of Subscribers. As a function of the application, Subscribers may customize the data that is collected from Users. Typically, the data collected is: First & Last Name, Email Address and Telephone number.

Except as specified elsewhere in this TimeTrade Policy Statement, TimeTrade considers all User information collected by TimeTrade on behalf of a Subscriber to be the proprietary information of the applicable Subscriber. A Subscriber, however, may share their proprietary information pursuant to their own privacy policy.

TimeTrade employees may periodically access Subscriber data solely for administrative purposes, application support, or to improve systems efficiency and add enhancements.

If required by law, TimeTrade may access or disclose information collected by our systems on behalf of a Subscriber, to appropriate authorities. Unless otherwise prohibited, a disclosure request shall be promptly communicated to the Subscriber, i.e. data owner.

**7.  ** **Personally-identifiable Information**

The functionality of the TimeTrade services allows Subscribers to collect information required for the scheduling of their own appointments and services. Pursuant to best practices and privacy regulations, Subscribers should limit the amount of personally identifiable information collected to only that which is strictly necessary. A Subscriber should never ask for a credit card number or government identification number via the TimeTrade services.  If other sensitive information, such as PII, is required for the Subscriber to perform services, consider collecting or entering only the last four digits of account information.

**8\. Scheduling & Appointment Confidentiality**

TimeTrade internally classifies all scheduling and appointment information as confidential and proprietary to the Subscriber. TimeTrade will never share a Subscriber’s schedule or appointment data with any third party outside the scope of TimeTrade’s services. For user experience, analytical and support purposes TimeTrade may record Subscriber User session-specific information, such as source IP, accessing browser and which pages or functions within application were accessed.  For Users scheduling appointments with a Subscriber, TimeTrade will not share their scheduling information with anyone except the Subscriber with whom they are making an appointment. A Subscriber can only view information relating to their instance of services.

**9.  ** **Links To Other Websites**

Other websites and applications not under the direct control of TimeTrade are not governed by this Privacy Statement. Emails generated by Subscribers as part of the TimeTrade services may contain links to enable Users to visit other websites.

TimeTrade does not intentionally collect any personally-identifiable information from individuals under the age of 13. No part of TimeTrade’s Website is structured to attract anyone under the age of 13. If a child has provided TimeTrade or a TimeTrade Subscriber with personally-identifiable information via the Websites or application and the parent or guardian would like this information removed from the Subscriber’s data, the parent or guardian of that child should contact the Subscriber and ask that the data be removed from their records. If further assistance is needed, contact TimeTrade directly at privacytimetrade.com and we will use reasonable efforts to assist in the deletion of the child's personally-identifiable information.
