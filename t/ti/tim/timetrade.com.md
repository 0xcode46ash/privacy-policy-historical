**3\. Use of Information Gathered by TimeTrade During Registration For Services or Other General Inquiries.**  
When you visit TimeTrade’s Website for information regarding our products, promotions, employment opportunities or register to use TimeTrade services, TimeTrade may gather information about you such as your name, business type, contact information, email address, payment method, and billing address information. If you disclose any personal data to us, you consent to our processing and use of such personal data in accordance with this Privacy Statement. Information may be used to: a) contact you directly regarding TimeTrade services, career opportunities and/or to respond to your inquiries; or b) provide invoicing of the subscribed services.

Unless permission is provided through our Opt-in process, we will not sell, share, or rent your personal information to any third party or use your e-mail address for unsolicited mail. Any emails sent by TimeTrade will only be in connection with the provision of agreed services, products or inquiries.

**4\. Sharing of Collected Information, “Opt-in”**  
The SMB product offering provides an “opt-in” option for Subscribers and their associated Users to receive further information from TimeTrade and third parties. If the User or Subscriber opts-in, TimeTrade may share names and email addresses with selected partners so that such partners may contact them with offers that may be of interest to them. Users and Subscribers can opt-out of receiving such information at any time by unsubscribing to the marketing emails via the unsubscribe links presented in the email. Enterprise Subscriber data is not used or included in any TimeTrade or third party marketing programs.

**5\. Credit Card Transactions**  
Online credit card payments related to SMB subscriptions are processed by a PCI certified payment processing vendor utilizing secure, encrypted payment card processing methods. Financial information will not be shared with any party not directly involved with billing of the services.

**6\. Use of Information by Subscribers**  
The TimeTrade applications collect data in order to schedule services on behalf of Subscribers. As a function of the application, Subscribers may customize the data that is collected from Users. Typically, the data collected is: First & Last Name, Email Address and Telephone number.  
Except as specified elsewhere in this TimeTrade Policy Statement, TimeTrade considers all User information collected by TimeTrade on behalf of a Subscriber to be the proprietary information of the applicable Subscriber. A Subscriber, however, may share their proprietary information pursuant to their own privacy policy.  
TimeTrade employees may periodically access Subscriber data solely for administrative purposes, application support, or to improve systems efficiency and add enhancements.  
If required by law, TimeTrade may access or disclose information collected by our systems on behalf of a Subscriber, to appropriate authorities. Unless otherwise prohibited, a disclosure request shall be promptly communicated to the Subscriber, i.e. data owner.

**7\. Personally-identifiable Information**  
The functionality of the TimeTrade services allows Subscribers to collect information required for the scheduling of their own appointments and services. Pursuant to best practices and privacy regulations, Subscribers should limit the amount of personally identifiable information collected to only that which is strictly necessary. A Subscriber should never ask for a credit card number or government identification number via the TimeTrade services. If other sensitive information, such as PII, is required for the Subscriber to perform services, consider collecting or entering only the last four digits of account information.

**8\. Scheduling & Appointment Confidentiality**  
TimeTrade internally classifies all scheduling and appointment information as confidential and proprietary to the Subscriber. TimeTrade will never share a Subscriber’s schedule or appointment data with any third party outside the scope of TimeTrade’s services. For user experience, analytical and support purposes TimeTrade may record Subscriber User session-specific information, such as source IP, accessing browser and which pages or functions within application were accessed. For Users scheduling appointments with a Subscriber, TimeTrade will not share their scheduling information with anyone except the Subscriber with whom they are making an appointment. A Subscriber can only view information relating to their instance of services.

**9\. Links To Other Websites**  
Other websites and applications not under the direct control of TimeTrade are not governed by this Privacy Statement. Emails generated by Subscribers as part of the TimeTrade services may contain links to enable Users to visit other websites. Be aware that TimeTrade does not have any control over the target website and cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information that a User provides while visiting them. Caution should be exercised when visiting unknown websites, and the privacy statement applicable to the website in question should be reviewed prior to use.

**10\. Children**  
Children should request permission from their parent or guardian prior to sending personal information online. TimeTrade does not intentionally collect any personally-identifiable information from individuals under the age of 13. No part of TimeTrade’s Website is structured to attract anyone under the age of 13. If a child has provided TimeTrade or a TimeTrade Subscriber with personally-identifiable information via the Websites or application and the parent or guardian would like this information removed from the Subscriber’s data, the parent or guardian of that child should contact the Subscriber and ask that the data be removed from their records. If further assistance is needed, contact TimeTrade directly at [privacy@timetrade.com](mailto:privacy@timetrade.com) and we will use reasonable efforts to assist in the deletion of the child’s personally-identifiable information.

**11\. Non-Personally-Identifiable Information Automatically Collected**

TimeTrade voluntarily complies with the Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union (EU) member countries to the United States. TimeTrade has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability of Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

TimeTrade respects an EU individual’s rights to access personal information about them, and to limit use and disclosure of their personal information. TimeTrade has limited ability to access information our customers submit to our services, however, if you wish to request access, to limit use, or to limit disclosure, please provide the name of the TimeTrade customer who submitted your personal information to our services. We will refer your request to that customer, and will support them as needed in responding to your request.

As described in the Privacy Shield Principles, TimeTrade is accountable for personal information that it receives and subsequently transfers to third parties. If third parties that process personal information on our behalf do so in a manner that does not comply with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are accountable, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

Individuals in the EU may submit inquiries or complaints related to our processing of personal information under the Privacy Shield Framework directly to us at the e-mail address listed below in Section 16. In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, TimeTrade maintains an independent mechanism to investigate unresolved Privacy Shield complaints regarding our compliance to the Privacy Shield Principles. If we have not been able to successfully resolve your inquiry or complaint and you are based in the EU, you may raise your inquiry or complaint to JAMS ADR at <https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield>. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you. In addition, as further explained in the Privacy Shield Principles, a binding arbitration option will also be made available to you in order to address residual complaints not resolved by any other means.

TimeTrade privacy practices are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and as such TimeTrade is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the FTC.
