# Privacy Policy

##### PRIVACY STATEMENT  


This privacy statement covers the practices used for both the site WWW.TIMEATLAS.COM and Productivity Portfolio Newsletter.  


If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, please [email](mailto:privacy@timeatlas.com) us. 

##### _Information Collection and Use_

_**Information Collection**_  


Productivity Portfolio is the sole owner of the information collected on WWW.TIMEATLAS.COM. Productivity Portfolio collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site.

_**Newsletter Registration**_  


In order to subscribe to the newsletter, a user must first complete the subscriber profile form. During this process a subscriber is required to give contact information such as name and email address. We use this information to distribute the newsletter. In order to provide a personalized newsletter we also require information regarding a subscriber's hardware and software. Examples include which email program do you use and so on.

_**Orders**_  


Our payment processor, PayPal, requests information from the subscriber on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name and email) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user. **We do not have access to your PayPal financial data.**

##### _Information Use_

##### _**Profile**_  


We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that reflects their article preferences. We do not share your profile with other third parties. 

If a user chooses a trail subscription, but does not subscribe at the end of the trial period, his or her profile is deleted from the database. The same procedure is true for subscribers who opt not to renew.

##### _**Cookies**_  


A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Within each of the two cookies is a value that identifies your profile so the proper articles display for you. Without this cookie, a user will only see those articles which are coded for all users. In addition, some of our vendors use cookies on their sites to authenticate the user and keep track of the user session.

##### _**Log Files**_  


Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

##### _**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**_  


We use a software technology called clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which articles the recipients have opened. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track articles. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain newsletters. For example 89% of users read the article on removing duplicate entries from the Palm. These statistics also help us determine if the subject matter warrants another article later on. 

#####   
_Sharing_

_**Legal Disclaimer**_  


Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

_**Service Providers**_  


We use several third parties to provide specific services in the construction and distribution of the newsletter. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

##### _**Choice/Opt-out**_

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter may opt-out of receiving these communications by using the **Remove** link located on each newsletter. 

##### _**Links**_

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

#####   
**_Tell-A-Friend_**  


If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site or newsletter, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Productivity Portfolio will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. Productivity Portfolio stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. 

##### _Security_

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.

When our newsletter/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. While on a secure page, such as the payment form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job or service are granted access to personally identifiable information. 

#####   
_Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information_

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as email address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can be done at the [Support](https://web.archive.org/web/20040606130434id_/http%3A//www.timeatlas.com/support.htm) page or by emailing our [Customer Support](mailto:privacy@timeatlas.com).

**If a user chooses a trail subscription, but does not subscribe at the end of the trial period, his or her profile is deleted from the database.** **The same procedure is true for subscribers who opt not to renew.**

##### _Notification of Changes_

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
