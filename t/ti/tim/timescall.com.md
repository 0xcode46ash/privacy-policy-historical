TimesCall.com collects information when you place a classified ad online, subscribe online, enter a contest, or send us an e-mail. Our tracking software monitors IP addresses and referring URLs, along with other information about what you view on the site. We do not extract individual information from those logs. We use the aggregate statistical information to help us understand how users view our sites. 

TimesCall.com uses outside service providers for several of our website services. We do not control their privacy policies nor do we control those of our advertisers. 

While information you submit to us is transmitted and stored securely, there is an inherent risk that a hacker could potentially gain entrance to the servers where your information is kept. TimesCall.com is not responsible for accidental loss or theft of your personal information. 

Information may be shared with advertisers who sponsor a contest or whose ads are seen on the site. Lehman Communications Corp. may choose to e-mail anyone who has shared information with us, to tell them about specific promotions that we or our advertisers are offering. 

No information you provide will be sold or given to third-party vendors. 

TimesCall.com does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. We have no means, however, for verifying a userâ€™s age. If we become aware that we have received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of 13, we will promptly delete the information from our records. We ask for parents to fill in all online contests directed at children.
