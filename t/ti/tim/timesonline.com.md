**Privacy Policy**

Timesonline.com collects information about you to enhance your experience on our website. We want to deliver news and information that's important to you. We will not sell your information to another party.

 **What does Timesonline.com collect? How will we use it?**

When you sign up as a registered user at Timesonline.com, we ask for some basic demographic information. We want to deliver news and information that's important to you. So we ask for your ZIP code or other information so we can customize your experience. We may also ask you for other information at other times — such as when you enter a contest or participate in a promotion, when you post an online ad, when you participate in our message boards, or when you order products from us. Whenever you provide personally identifiable information to us, we will make an effort to link to this privacy policy. Web servers for Timesonline.com automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information, such as which pages each user visits and the domain name (e.g., msn.com) of visitors. This information is used for various purposes including internal review, to tailor information to individual visitors, and for traffic audits. We also provide this information (as well as information from third-party market researchers) about our users in an aggregated, anonymous basis to our advertisers and potential advertisers. Timesonline.com places a "cookie" on users’ computers to store and sometimes track information. A cookie can be used to tell when your computer has contacted a website; we may also use this information for editorial purposes such as measuring traffic patterns (i.e. cookies can ensure that you don't see the same ad too many times in a session and that you do not have to re-enter your registration information during your visit). We may also use cookies to track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions and contests. Advertising service vendors that serve ads into our site may also use their own cookies. You may opt out of the cookies delivered by Timesonline.com by changing the setting on your browser. Be aware that this will disable all cookies delivered to your browser, not just the one delivered by Timesonline.com.

 **What about information I find on Timesonline.com?**

We don't mind if you share stories from our sites with friends and family, or if you copy them for your personal or educational use. However, all of the materials within Timesonline.com are copyrighted either to the originating newspaper (the Beaver County Times or the Ellwood City Ledger) or to Calkins Media, Inc. This information may not be reproduced or republished without our expressed written consent. Other publishing mediums include, but are not limited to, websites, databases, newspapers, magazines, newsletters, radio or television.

 **What about information The Associated Press?**
