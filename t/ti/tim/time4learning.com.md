# time4learning.com - Contact Us

You have trusted us to make safe and quality content that children can enjoy.  In the cyberspace world, this trust is even more important to your family, and to time4leearning.com. To make sure that this site stays safe and fun, we make the following promises: 

  * In almost all activities, the information we collect is non-personal (such as first name, age, city and state). If you enter a contest, send us a question or send an electronic postcard, we will also ask for an e-mail address. We only collect enough information from our visitors to make activities on time4learning.com fun and interesting. 
  * If you submit stories, artwork, comments or anything else to us which is posted on our site, you will be identified on our site only by first name, age, city and state. 
  * If you send us an e-mail with a question or comment, or enter one of our contests, we will write back using your e-mail address, but we will not keep the address or use it again. 
  * If you ask time4learning.com to send an electronic postcard or e-mail message, we will ask for your first name and e-mail address as well as the e-mail address of the person who will receive the postcard. We will only use this information to send the postcard or message and we will delete the information when the postcard or message is sent. 
  * No one will be excluded from our site for not giving us personal information. When we do ask for personal information (like an e-mail address), we will only keep it until that particular activity is complete. We will not share this information with a third party. 
  * Children using the time4learning.com environment which requires a login, have been pre-approved through accounts set up by their parents. 



As you surf around time4learning.com, it is possible that several cookies* will be set on your computer. time4learning.com uses the information from cookies to deliver relevant local resources, remember browser preferences, and improve our visitors' experiences on the site. No personal information is ever stored in a time4learning.com cookie.

*What's a cookie? _A cookie is information a Web site puts on your computer's hard drive so that the site can remember your preferences or which pages you visited on that site._

time4learning.com only uses cookies at the following times: 

  * To capture the local time from your computer in order to properly set timers and counters. 
  * To remember parental login name (for easier access) and to automatically load the children associated with the parental account. 
  * As you explore pbskids.org, a session cookie will tell us which pages you visit and the amount of time between each page visit. This cookie does not remember any information about you or your computer, it just tells us at PBS Kids how long visitors spend on our sites and which pages receive the most traffic. A "session cookie" only remembers information about your current visit to the site. 




We also promise to help families and communities find the information they need to use the Internet safely and responsibly. 

  * When a PBS Kids site is partially funded by outside sponsors, we will mark any underwriter logos with a "sponsored by" tag. We choose our underwriters carefully, to make sure that the company's products and services fit PBS standards. PBS Kids sites will not contain advertisements promoting e-commerce or direct links to e-commerce. 
  * All links to third party sites are insulated with a time4learning.com bridge page. These pages clearly notify the visitor that he or she is leaving time4learning.com, and offers an opportunity to return to time4learning.com. Each bridge page displays a Web literacy tip, educating visitors how to be safe on the Internet. In the case of a sponsor's link, the bridge page will provide more information about the sponsor's relationship to time4learning.com. Since we cannot be assured that links to outside sites follow our safety or privacy guidelines, we encourage families to discuss these choices together. We are not responsible for the content or safety and privacy practices at any sites linked from our pages.
