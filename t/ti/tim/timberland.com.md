# TimberlandÂ® Customer Service

**Privacy Policy

At timberland.com, your privacy is our priority.

\- We won't sell, share, trade or rent any of your personal information except with your consent or as described in this Privacy Policy.

\- We use various security measures to protect the security and confidentiality of your personal information. 

** You value your privacy. And we respect that. When you shop with timberland.com and TimberlandPRO.com, we need to collect a certain amount of information about you to make shopping easier for you--and for us. We believe that you have a right to know how we use that information and how we keep it secure. So we've answered the most frequently asked questions below. If you have any more questions about our policy, just call us at 888-802-9947, or email us at [info@timberland.com](mailto:info@timberland.com), or write to us at The Timberland Company, Consumer Service, 200 Domain Drive, Stratham, New Hampshire 03885. We'll get back to you as quickly as possible. 

**What information do we collect?**

When you order from our website, we need to know your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, billing address, shipping address, credit card number and credit card expiration date so we can process and fill your order and contact you if we have any questions. Depending on the type of credit card you use to make your purchase, you may also be required to supply your card's 3-4 digit identification number.

You can also create an account with us by providing the same kind of information. As a timberland.com account holder, you can shop faster and you get special member benefits (such as the ability to track your packages and quick access to your saved addresses).

When you visit our website, we automatically collect clickstream information such as the address of the website that you came from before visiting our site, which pages you visit on our site, which browser you used to view our site and any search terms you may have entered on our site. This information is anonymous--meaning we cannot identify you personally--unless you identify yourself by making a purchase or by creating an account.

Now and then, we may run contests or other promotions. When you enter one of our contests, we'll probably ask for some required personal information such as your name, mailing address, email address and other information so we can run the promotion and notify winners. 

When you send a request, review or comment to our customer service department, we may ask for your email address in order to send you a response, if appropriate.

We may, from time to time, conduct online surveys. When you complete an online survey, we may ask for certain information from you including your age, zip code, shopping habits, email and/or mailing address.

If you visit our website and request information on The Timberland Company (such as career opportunities or participation in an Investor Relations presentation) we may ask you to identify yourself by name or email address. This information helps us assess the interest from prospective employees or investors and will only be used to respond to your request, if necessary.

**How do we use the information?**

When you place an order on our website, we use your information to process and fill your order. We may send you an email to confirm or to update you on your order. We may also need to contact you by regular mail, email or phone if we have any questions about your order.

When you order, create an account, complete a survey or participate in any contest or promotion on our website, we'll use the information to send email or regular mail to you about our products, services or other contests and promotions you might be interested in, unless you indicate that you do not wish to receive such mail.

We may also use the information to personalize your shopping experience by using your product interests, shopping patterns, and purchase information to recommend other products, services or promotions that we believe might interest you including those of other companies. We may also notify you of changes to the website. 

We maintain the information that you provide us, along with a record of your purchases, in a database. To best serve you, we may combine this information with data that is publicly available and data that we receive from other business partners and/or reputable sources whose policies meet the Direct Marketing Association's privacy standards.

Also, we may, from time to time, review your information and information of other customers to help us analyze trends, purchasing patterns and preferences, and demographics.

**Do we share your information with third parties?**

We share your information with our trusted third party service providers who manage our website. These third parties provide specific services and administer activities offered at our website; for example, call and email center and credit card processing. These third parties are not authorized to discuss, disclose or make any use of your personal information except as necessary to provide such services.

Now and then, we may also use third parties to help us collect and aggregate site guest and customer information. We may share this aggregated, non-personally identifiable information (such as age, clickstream visit, and product interests) with existing and prospective business partners and advertisers. None of the aggregate information will contain any information that identifies you individually.

We may also share your personal information with carefully screened Timberland business partners to offer you products and services that we believe might interest you. But only The Timberland Company, Timberland Retail, Inc., timberland.com or TimberlandPRO.com or other Timberland affiliates and business partners will send you these messages. In each case, our partners will not be authorized to discuss, disclose, or make any use of your personal information except for extending the offer to you. If you prefer not to be included in these types of propective offers, please let us know by sending an email to [nointerest@timberland.com](mailto:nointerest@timberland.com).

If you apply for the Timberland credit card online, you provide the personal and financial information needed to process your application directly to MBNA, the issuer and the administrator of the credit card program. MBNA is independent of Timberland and has its own privacy and security policies. You can review their policies at www.mbna.com.

We or our third party service providers may disclose specific individual information if we or they reasonably believe that it's necessary to comply with applicable laws or regulations or to protect the interests of The Timberland Company, Timberland Retail, Inc., timberland.com, TimberlandPRO.com, Timberland business partners, affiliates or its guests, or the interests of our third party service providers.

How can you access or change your information or opt out of receiving information about new products and promotions from us?

If you're a timberland.com account holder, just click "My Account" and enter your email address and password on the account Sign In page. You can review or change certain of your personal information from our website database. This includes the ability to "opt out," or indicate that you do not wish to receive email or regular mailings from us.

If you want to update your information or remove yourself from any of our email or regular mailing lists, simply email us at [info@timberland.com](mailto:info@timberland.com), call us at 888-802-9947 or write to us at The Timberland Company, Consumer Service, 200 Domain Drive, Stratham, New Hampshire 03885. Please note that your request to be removed from our email lists might take up to ten (10) business days to become effective (regular mailing lists may take up to 4-6 weeks). Even if you're removed from a list, if you order online, we will send you an email to confirm your order and may need to contact you by phone, email or regular mail if we have questions about your order. There will be an opportunity to unsubscribe within each promotional email that you receive from us so you can automatically remove your email address from our mailing list.

**How do we protect the privacy of children?**

We do not sell or ship any items ordered through this website directly to anyone who we know to be under the age of 18, nor do we collect any personal information from anyone who we know to be under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, you should use this website only with the involvement of a parent or guardian and should not submit any personal information to us.
