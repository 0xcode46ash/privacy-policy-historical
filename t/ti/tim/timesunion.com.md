# Albany, N.Y. : Timesunion.com : Privacy Policy

Our privacy policy

This privacy policy describes how Hearst Communications Inc., publisher of the Times Union, treats the personally identifiable information that is collected about you when you visit the Web sites of the Times Union, including [timesunion.com](http://timesunion.com/) and [albany2go.com](http://albany2go.com/). This policy also applies to information collected by third-party service providers, who gather information on our behalf. If you have any questions or concerns about these privacy guidelines, please send e-mail to [webmaster](mailto:webmaster@timesunion.com). 

This privacy policy does not apply to information collected about you by anyone except Hearst Communications ("Hearst") and its third-party service providers and only applies to the Web sites to which this policy is linked. Any information you provide when you visit Web sites other than those covered by this policy (including other Web sites affiliated with Hearst) or when you purchase any products or services that may be offered or advertised on our Web site by companies other than Hearst, is subject to the privacy policies of the organizations who run and/or own these Web sites. This policy does not apply to information you may provide to us offline, except where specifically stated. 

**What information does the Times Union collect?**

For individuals 13 and older, the Times Union collects "personally identifying information" only when you specifically and knowingly provide it. Here are some of the ways we gather and save this information: 

  * When you register to use timesunion.com 
  * During registration for a contest, forum or e-mail newsletter 
  * When you order a subscription online. 
  * When you purchase a story in our online archives. 
  * In timesunion.com/autos, when you request information about price quotes, trade-ins, financing and email notifications about vehicles.



(The Times Union also gathers names and e-mail addresses when you send electronic postcards and forward articles to friends using the link that appears at the bottom of most stories. However, we do not store this information; it is used only to send the postcard or story.) 

At the bottom of some pages that collect your personally identifiable information, we ask if you would like to receive updates about the Times Union, timesunion.com, albany2go.com or features or targeted promotions from our advertisers. This opt-in system defaults to "no" unless you check otherwise. 

The Times Union also collects non-personally identifiable information including the server that your computer is logged onto, your operating system and your Web browser type. This information is gathered in server log files for traffic analysis, via online forms for help and troubleshooting and by our ad server software (247RealMedia's OpenAdStream) when an advertisement is presented. The information collected by the ad server is not personally identifiable and is used only to measure traffic and advertising effectiveness. 

**What about cookies?**

If you turn on the cookie notification setting of your browser, you will see that we sometimes place a "cookie" on your computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information about you. Rather, we use cookies for several purposes, such as: 

  * 1) To analyze traffic and user behavior on timesunion.com; 
  * 2) To target advertising and measure ad impressions and click-throughs; 
  * 3) To record user name and password information while you are visiting our archives; 
  * 4) to track voting in our polls.



Some of our advertisers may serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers. 

If you don't want cookies, most Web browsers include an option that allows you to not accept them. However, if you set your browser to refuse cookies, some portions of our sites may not function efficiently. 

**How does the Times Union use the information it collects?**

The Times Union uses this information to provide you with the service you have requested. If you subscribe to the Times Union, we may use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice and your mailing address to deliver the paper. Similarly, if you enter an online sweepstakes, we will use this information to notify you if you are a winner. The information you provide on timesunion.com/autos is shared with our car dealer partners and may be used by them to contact you about car offers and financing arrangements. We have no control over what those car dealers do with the information you provide. 

If you opt-in by checking the box at the bottom of registration forms, your personally identifying information may be used for additional purposes, such as e-mailing you with information about new features and offers from the Times Union, albany2go.com or timesunion.com. In addition, if you opt-in, we may send you advertising information or other offers we think may be of interest. Individuals always have the ability to stop receiving these e-mails by sending an e-mail request to us at [webmaster@timesunion.com](mailto:webmaster@timesunion.com) or visiting the [registration area](https://web.archive.org/registration/signup.asp) on timesunion.com to update your registration information. You may also make reasonable requests to review the personal data collected from you and to correct any errors. 

**Does the Times Union share the information with anyone else?**

The Times Union may disclose information with third parties if you have given your consent to that disclosure by checking the applicable space. Information you provide via our third-party service providers generally is forwarded directly to us, and those providers are instructed not to use the data for any other purpose. However, on timesunion.com/autos, the information you submit when you request more information on a vehicle will be sent by the service provider directly to the auto dealer partners of the Times Union. As mentioned, we do not control what use they may make of it. 

The Times Union may disclose information if it is required by law through a subpoena, a search warrant or another legal process or if we need to protect our legal rights (for example, if we are trying to collect money you owe us for a subscription). In this instance, the disclosure may take place without your consent. In addition, we may disclose information to third party service providers we use to provide products, services or functions on our behalf (such as sending emails or processing credit cards or fulfilling subscriptions), and ask these service providers to agree to maintain the confidentiality of your information and not to use it for any reason except to carry out the purpose for which we hired them. Finally, we may share your information with entities under control of, or under common control with Hearst (for these purposes, a company controlling twenty (20%) percent or more of the voting stock of another entity shall be deemed to control such entity). 

Beyond that, the information is not shared with any third parties. 

**What about information I share in your forums?**

You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., your name, e-mail address) in the forums, blogs, chat areas, or the user-created Web sites in timesunion.com/communities, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. 

**When was this privacy policy most recently updated?**

We updated this privacy policy on May 18, 2006. We reserve the right to change this policy at any time. Your continued use of our sites indicates your consent to this privacy policy and any amended versions of it. 

**Are you a non-U.S. user?**

If you are located outside of the United States, please note that the information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States. By using this web site, you consent to this transfer. You also consent to the adjudication of any disputes arising in connection with this Web site in the federal and state courts of, and in accordance with the laws of, the state of the United States in which the editorial staff of this Web site primarily does business. 

**Are you a Californian or Canadian user?**

California and Canadian residents have the right to know how their information may be shared with third parties who engage in direct marketing activities and this policy explains our practices and how you can opt out of having your information shared for such purposes. We sometimes make our customer lists available to companies that sell goods and services that we believe would be of interest if you have opted in to receive such offers. We may compile these lists from customer orders placed both offline and online. Customers have the option of having their names and identifying information removed from those lists (subject to certain exceptions and limitations in applicable laws) by contacting us at [webmaster](mailto:webmaster@timesunion.com). 

**Still have questions or concerns?**

Send e-mail to us at [webmaster](mailto:webmaster@timesunion.com) with any further questions. 

**Children Under 13 Years Old:**

The Times Union does not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us -- including information like your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information or use our public forums. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at: [webmaster@timesunion.com](mailto:webmaster@timesunion.com).

 **Children, 13-18 Years Old:**

We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.
