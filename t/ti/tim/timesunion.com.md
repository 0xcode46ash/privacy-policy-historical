# timesunion.com : about us : privacy policy

**Privacy policy of timesunion.com**

If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy guidelines, please send an e-mail to [**webmaster@timesunion.com**](mailto:webmaster@timesunion.com).

**What information does timesunion.com collect?**

For individuals 13 and older, timesunion.com collects "personally identifying information" only when a user specifically and knowingly provides it. We gather and save this information in the following ways: 

  * During registration for a contest, poll or forum
  

  * Via e-mail and feedback forms
  * When a user sets up a library account using our secure socket.
  



(Timesunion.com also gathers names and e-mail addresses when users send electronic postcards and forward articles to friends using the link that appears at the bottom of most stories. However, we do not store this information; it is used only to send the postcard or story.) 

At the bottom of pages that collect your personally identifiable information, we ask if you would like to receive updates about timesunion.com features or targeted promotions from our advertisers. This opt-in system defaults to "no" unless you check otherwise.

Timesunion.com also collects non-personally identifiable information including the server the user's computer is logged onto, the user's operating system and the user's browser type (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer). This information is gathered in server log files for traffic analysis, via online forms for user help and troubleshooting and by our ad server software (RealMedia's OpenAdStream) when an advertisement is presented to a user. The information collected by the ad server is not personally-identifiable and is used only to measure traffic and advertising effectiveness on behalf of timesunion.com advertisers.

**What about cookies?**

If you turn on the cookie notification setting of your browser, you will see that we sometimes place a "cookie" on your computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information about you. Rather, we use cookies for several purposes:

  * To analyze traffic on timesunion.com and measure click throughs to our advertisers' sites.
  * To track voting in our polls.
  * To monitor usage of our archives.



**How does timesunion.com use the information it collects?**

If you opt-in by checking the box at the bottom of registration forms, your personally identifying information may be used for editorial purposes, such as e-mailing you with information about new features of timesunion.com. In addition, if you opt-in, we may send you advertising information. 

Individuals always have the ability to stop their information from being used for any purposes by sending an e-mail request to us at [**webmaster@timesunion.com**](mailto:webmaster@timesunion.com). You may also make reasonable requests to review the personal data collected from you and to correct any errors. 

Currently, none of your information is merged with other data available from the Times Union Circulation or Business departments or information sourced from third party providers. We reserve the right to do so in the future. 

Information may be stored for up to four years.

**What do you do with the information I provided to set up an account for your online library?**

Library account information is used only to track and bill you for using the online library. You can verify, and [correct if necessary](https://www.timesunion.com/library/secure/chgacct.asp), your library account information. 

**Does timesunion.com share the information with anyone else?**

timesunion.com may disclose information if it is required by law through a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process. In this instance, the disclosure may take place without the user's consent. 

Beyond that, the information is not shared with any third parties. 

In addition, while we will seek to require third parties with whom we have agreements to follow appropriate privacy policies, we do not bear responsibility for any actions or policies of third parties. 

**How can I be sure that the privacy policy is maintained?**

To ensure internal compliance with this privacy policy, the Online editor of timesunion.com reviews and authorizes any use of timesunion.com information. In addition, if we substantively change the policy regarding use of your information, we will notify affected users or delete the stored personally identifiable information of those affected users. This policy was last updated on February 24, 2001 

**What about information I share in your forums?**

You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., your name, e-mail address) in the forums or in the chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. 

**Still have questions or concerns?**

Users can send e-mail to us at [**webmaster@timesunion.com**](mailto:webmaster@timesunion.com) with any further questions. 

**Children Under 13 Years Old:**

timesunion.com does not knowingly collect or solicit personally-identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us -- including information like your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. 

In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. 

If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at: [**webmaster@timesunion.com**](mailto:webmaster@timesunion.com). timesunion.com conforms to the requirements of the [**Children's Online Privacy Protection Act**](http://www.ftc.gov/os/1999/9910/64fr59888.htm) (COPPA).

**Children, 13-18 Years Old:**
