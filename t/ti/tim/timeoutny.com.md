# Time Out New York []

**Our privacy policy**

_Time Out New York ("TONY")_ has always promised to serve its audience with integrity and honesty. The same is true now that we publish online. _TONY_ has developed this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and to disclose our information-gathering and -sharing practices for www.timeoutny.com (the "site"). By visiting the site, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy. Our site will develop and evolve over time, and this policy may change to reflect that. 

**The _TONY_ privacy promise**

We are absolutely committed to protecting your privacy. We are also committed to the following: (1) We will not pass on any individual user details unless we have your prior consent; and (2) if we don’t have your consent to pass on individual user details, we will only give advertisers aggregate statistics about the number of users and their traffic patterns.

**Personal information**

_TONY_ does not require you to provide any personal information in order to access the site. However, if you choose to fill out any reader surveys, order items from the _TONY_ Store or participate in a contest, you will be asked to supply some information about yourself, including your name, address, phone number and e-mail address. _TONY_ does keep track of the number of visitors to the site, the pages they visit and how long they stay. In addition, _TONY_ collects information from visitors who click on banner advertisements so that we are able to measure interest in the various areas of our site and inform advertisers as to how many visitors have seen or clicked on their advertising banners. _TONY_ also uses demographic and preference information to allow advertising banners on our site to be targeted, in the aggregate, to the readers for whom they are most pertinent. 

We collect these kinds of personal information for four main reasons: (1) to help us continually improve the service we offer; (2) to sell advertising space on the site to appropriate advertisers; (3) to introduce willing users to companies associated with _TONY;_ and (4) to e-mail users with details of offers and competitions (for as long as they wish to receive such information). _TONY_ discloses this information to advertisers. 

**Your right to decide how your personal information is used**

Areas of our site that request personal information contain a box that, if checked, will enable _TONY_ to contact you for internal marketing purposes (e.g., to send you information about special events, discounts and offers). If you don’t want your information to be used for any of these purposes, you should not check the box. If we ever request that you volunteer additional information, such as financial data or age—in an online survey, for example—your response will always be voluntary. In addition, there will always be a box for you to check if you choose to enable us to disclose such information to a third party.

**Third-party disclosure of personal information**
