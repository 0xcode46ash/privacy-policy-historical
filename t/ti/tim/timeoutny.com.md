The _TONY_ privacy promise

We are absolutely committed to protecting your privacy. We are also committed to the following: (1) We will not pass on any individual user details unless we have your prior consent; and (2) if we don't have your consent to pass on individual user details, we will only give advertisers aggregate statistics about the number of users and their traffic patterns. However, if _TONY_ changes hands, _TONY_ reserves the right to transfer all information collected through this site to the new owner.

Personal information

 _TONY_ requests a limited amount of information from you in order to grant access to selected content. _TONY_ may use this information to contact you directly regarding your relationship with the website. This information will not be used for promotional purposed. However, if you choose to fill out any reader surveys, order items from the _TONY_ Store or participate in a contest, information that you submit about yourself, including your name, address, phone number and e-mail address, may be shared with associated sponsors in aggregate form, or directly when noted.

We collect these kinds of aggregate user information for two main reasons:(1) to help us continually improve the service we offer; and (2) to sell sponsorships on the site to appropriate advertisers. _TONY_ discloses this information to advertisers. Note that advertisers do not have influence over the editorial content or reviews that appear on the site. 

Information collected includes: the number of visitors to the site, the pages they visit and how long they stay. In addition, _TONY_ collects information from visitors who click on advertisements so that we are able to measure interest in the various areas of our site and inform advertisers as to how many visitors have seen or clicked on their ads. _TONY_ also uses demographic and preference information to allow advertising banners on our site to be targeted, in the aggregate, to the readers for whom they are most pertinent.
