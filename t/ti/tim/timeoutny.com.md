# Time Out New York []

**Our privacy policy**

_Time Out New York ("TONY")_ has always promised to serve its audience with integrity and honesty. The same is true now that we publish online. _TONY_ has developed this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and to disclose our information-gathering and -sharing practices for www.timeoutny.com (the "site"). By visiting the site, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy. Our site will develop and evolve over time, and this policy may change to reflect that.

In addition, _Time Out New York_ supports the Consumer WebWatch guidelines to promote credible information practices on the Web. For more information, [click here](http://www.consumerwebwatch.org/bestpractices/index.html).

**The _TONY_ privacy promise**

We are absolutely committed to protecting your privacy. We are also committed to the following: (1) We will not pass on any individual user details unless we have your prior consent; and (2) if we don’t have your consent to pass on individual user details, we will only give advertisers aggregate statistics about the number of users and their traffic patterns. However, if _TONY_ changes hands, _TONY_ reserves the right to transfer all information collected through this site to the new owner.

**Personal information**

_TONY_ does not require you to provide any personal information in order to access the site. However, if you choose to fill out any reader surveys, order items from the _TONY_ Store or participate in a contest, you will be asked to supply some information about yourself, including your name, address, phone number and e-mail address. _TONY_ keeps track of the number of visitors to the site, the pages they visit and how long they stay. In addition, _TONY_ collects information from visitors who click on advertisements so that we are able to measure interest in the various areas of our site and inform advertisers as to how many visitors have seen or clicked on their ads. _TONY_ also uses demographic and preference information to allow advertising banners on our site to be targeted, in the aggregate, to the readers for whom they are most pertinent. 

We collect these kinds of aggregate user information for two main reasons: (1) to help us continually improve the service we offer; and (2) to sell sponsorships on the site to appropriate advertisers. _TONY_ discloses this information to advertisers. Note that advertisers do not have influence over the editorial content or reviews that appear on the site. 

**Cookies and TONY**

_Time Out New York's_ main site at www.timeoutny.com does not use cookies. If you subscribe to the Time Out New York Eating & Drinking site, however, we use cookies to track your usage on our site. This ensures that you are a subscriber, and allows you to roam freely within our subscriber-based site without typing in a password to access each page. We do not track any of your activity as it relates to your individual movements throughout our site, only as an aggregate of data in conjunction with users to our site as a whole. Your movement is not tracked once you leave our site.

**_TONY_ e-mail policy**

When you give us your e-mail address, you are also asked to let us know how we can use it: You can opt to allow us to e-mail you regarding your subscription, or to allow us to send you additional information via e-mail that we believe will be of interest to you. Such requests will be opt-in only, so that you do not inadvertently agree to receive mailings you do not want.

If you place an order in our online store, purchase a subscription to Eating & Drinking Online, or participate in an online survey, you may receive a one-time mailing to confirm your transaction or interaction with our site. Such mailings are one-time only. When you give us your e-mail address under these circumstances, you will also see a box that, when checked by you, will enable _TONY_ to contact you via e-mail regarding special events, discounts and offers. If you don't want your information to be used for any of these purposes, you should not check the box. 

If we ever request that you volunteer additional information, such as financial data or age—in an online survey, for example—your response will always be voluntary. In addition, there will always be a box for you to check if you choose to enable us to disclose such information to a third party.

Subscribers to the print edition of _TONY_ may opt to receive a regular e-mail newsletter that contains information we believe to be of value to our users, specifically special discounts and offers selected by our marketing department. These mailings are exclusive to _TONY_ magazine subscribers; visit [www.timeoutny.com/newsletter/](http://www.timeoutny.com/newsletter/) to sign-up for the free list. Such mailings include an invisible image that allows _TONY_ to determine if an e-mail was viewed, in that it calls our server and registers a count. This image is solely for the purpose of providing aggregate data to our advertisers. Individual actions are never tracked, and we do not record whether or not you as an individual read or opened any communication from _TONY._ We respect that your receiving the e-mails is a choice, and you may choose to remove your name from the list at any time by visiting <http://www.timeoutny.com/newsletter/unsubscribe.php>.
