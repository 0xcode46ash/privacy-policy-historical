# timesofmalta.com - Privacy

This statement discloses the privacy practices for timesofmalta.com.

We have adopted a set of information management guidelines which serve as the basis for our customer and advertiser relationships. These guidelines have been developed with the recognition that Internet technologies are rapidly evolving, and that underlying business models are still not established. Accordingly, guidelines are subject to change. Any such changes will be posted on this page. If the changes represent a material departure from our current practices with respect to the use of personal information, the changes will be posted on this page thirty days prior to taking effect and registered users will be notified via email.

We are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of websites to which we may link.

**Registration** : During the free newsletter registration process prior to receiving our headlines in your mail, you are required to supply a unique email address, and demographic information (full name, address, city, post code, country, phone number are required). On occasion, we also collect additional personal information from subscribers in connection with optional contests, surveys, or special offers.

**Statistical Analysis and Banner Advertising** : We may perform statistical analyses of user behaviour in order to measure interest in the various areas of our site (for product development purposes) and to inform advertisers as to how many consumers have seen or "clicked" their advertising banners. We will also use demographic and preference information to allow advertising banners on our web site to be targeted, in aggregate, to the readers for whom they are most pertinent. This means that readers will see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers will send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer's experience and the effectiveness of the ads. In this statistical analyses and banner advertisement targeting, we will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form. Personal information about you as an individual subscriber will not be provided to any third party without your consent.
