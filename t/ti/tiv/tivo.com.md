# About TiVo Inc.

  


## Site Privacy Policy

TiVo Inc. has created this Site Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. 

The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices only for this web site: [www.tivo.com.](http://www.tivo.com/) TiVo has a separate privacy policy that controls our use of information that is gathered as part of the TiVo service. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our web site. However, we do not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily submit such information to us. Our site uses an order form for you to request information, products, and services. Contact information (like your email address) from the order form is collected and used to send you information about our company. Your contact information is also used to get in touch with you when necessary. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings: see the Choice/Opt-Out section below.

We do not wish to obtain personally identifiable information from children who are using our site unsupervised. Thus, we ask children to obtain the consent of their parent or guardian before providing us with any personally identifiable information. This site contains links to other sites. www.tivo.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites.

**_Security_**  
We use industry-standard methods to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access. Among other techniques, we usually store such information on a computer behind our "firewall" in a secure location, and we often restrict the number of employees internally who can access such data. Of course, there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet. Further, please note that our servers are run by a third party web host whose actions we do not control. 

**_Disclosure of Information_**  
Unless we tell you otherwise, we do not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to any third parties. However, we might share your personally identifiable information with other members of the TiVo family, and we do sell and rent aggregated (non-personally identifiable) information about our users generally. 

**_Use of Information_**  
We use personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information for internal marketing purposes and for site administration. However, unless we tell you otherwise, we usually do not use personally identifiable information collected from the web site to send unsolicited mailings to you. Of course, if applicable, we do use personally identifiable information to perform the services for which such data was collected (i.e., if you sign up for an email newsletter, we will send the email newsletter to the address you provide us).
