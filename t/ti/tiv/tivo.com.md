# Privacy Policy | TiVo

Our goal is to give TiVo users the best TV-watching experience possible, and we have updated this policy so that TiVo users can better understand our treatment of their personal information.

Effective as of August 20, 2013

## Introduction

This privacy policy describes how TiVo Inc. collects, uses, discloses, and protects information received from or about users of our products and services. 

A few things to note:

  * When we refer to “TiVo products” in this policy, we mean any device, software, or website offered by TiVo (including TiVo DVRs, the TiVo Mini, the TiVo Stream, TiVo mobile apps, and tivo.com). 
  * When we say “you” in this policy, we mean both you and any other individuals you let use your TiVo device, software, or account. 
  * TiVo products provided to you directly by your cable or satellite provider are subject to their privacy policy (and not this policy). 



## Collection and Use of Information

How do we collect information?  
We collect information (both automatically and when we ask you to provide it) when you use TiVo products, place orders, contact customer service, and participate in surveys. We may also let you link a TiVo product with your account on a third-party service, such as Facebook or Twitter. We may also acquire a business that has information about you, or otherwise acquire information about you from third parties.

What information are we collecting?

Information we ask you to provide us may include, for example, your name, email address, phone number, shipping address, billing address, credit card information, and age or other demographic information. 

Information we automatically collect may include, for example, data about your viewing behavior (such as how you use, watch, record, rate and interact with content accessed on or through TiVo products), device (such as model number, software versions, and unique device identifiers), location (such as GPS data, zip code, and time zone), and cable service (such as cable provider and cable channels).

Information we collect from your account on a third-party service with your consent may include data about you and your friends from that service (such as what you or they have liked or shared). 

How do we use information we collect about you?  
We use the information we collect to provide you with requested products and services, notify you of changes to our policies or products, notify you of offers that may interest you, process your orders, assist you in purchasing TiVo products, activate and renew your subscriptions, identify or troubleshoot issues, conduct surveys, improve the products and services we provide to you, and otherwise operate our business. 

As part of providing you with a more personalized experience when using TiVo products, we may use information we collect to: 

  1. analyze your viewing habits (which lets us do things like suggest a particular TV show or movie that you may enjoy);
  2. analyze your usage of TiVo product features (which lets us understand things like how many times a particular TV show was recorded, or how many of our users are watching content on a Netflix or YouTube app);
  3. combine information we collect from your use of different TiVo products (which lets us do things like make it possible for you to start a show in one room and finish it in another); and
  4. show you more relevant ads (both on TiVo products and on third-party websites).



We may also use information we collect in our analytics business, where we use data that has been either de-identified or aggregated (or both) to generate insights into consumer behaviors (for example, to show what the most watched commercial was during a particular show). 

If we acquire a business that has information about you, or otherwise acquire information about you from third parties, we may (subject to applicable law) combine that information with the information we already hold. This should enable us to provide you with improved or enhanced products or services. 

## Disclosure of Personal Information

We are not in the business of selling your personal information to third parties. We will disclose your personal information to third parties only if: 

  1. we get your consent; 
  2. we are required to do so by applicable law, legal process, and/or governmental authorities;
  3. we believe disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, our customers, or others; 
  4. we are involved in a merger, acquisition, partial or total sale of assets, or other corporate change; 
  5. they are a joint venture partner or an entity we own or control (or that owns or controls us) that is either subject to this policy or follows privacy practices at least as protective as these; or 
  6. they provide services to us (such as processing credit card payments or collecting past due debts) and have agreed to use your information only for the purposes we request.



We may disclose de-identified, aggregated, or other non-personal information to third parties in our discretion. For example, we may provide reports showing aggregated information regarding our users to advertisers, networks, and others (like a report that shows what type of viewers watch a particular TV show, so that advertisers can reach similar viewers on other platforms). 

Note that TiVo products may include commenting, forums, sharing, or other similar functionality. Information that you provide using these features (such as your name, your posts, or TV shows you have watched) may be available to other users or the general public. 

## Protection of Personal Information

We have reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic, and administrative measures in place to safeguard the security of your personal information. 

## Location of Personal Information and U.S. – EU Safe Harbor

Your personal information may be maintained, processed and stored by TiVo, our affiliates, and our service providers in the United States or other jurisdictions. TiVo adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Union (EU), and has Safe Harbor self-assessment procedures in place. The Safe Harbor program is intended to provide equivalent protections for personal data as exist in the EU. For more information about the Safe Harbor and to view our certification, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor website at [http://export.gov/safeharbor/](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/). 

If you have any questions about our Safe Harbor participation, please contact us using the information below. If you believe that TiVo has not satisfactorily addressed your data privacy concerns related to the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, and without prejudice to any other remedy you may enjoy, you may obtain dispute resolution services through the International Centre for Dispute Resolution, a division of the American Arbitration Association. To use these services, you can file a claim at <https://apps.adr.org/webfile/>. 

## Third-Party Services

Our products and services may enable you to access or otherwise use third-party products and services, and our websites may contain links to third-party websites. Such third parties have their own policies that govern their collection, use, and disclosure of information. We suggest that you read their privacy policies to learn about their practices. 

You may choose to link your accounts on certain social networking services with your TiVo account or with your TiVo products (such as a TiVo DVR or mobile app). If you do so, you may be able to publish information to the linked social networking service, and we may be able to publish such information on your behalf. Please note that any information you choose to publish to or share with the linked social networking service (such as your viewing information) will become subject to the privacy policy and other terms of that service.
