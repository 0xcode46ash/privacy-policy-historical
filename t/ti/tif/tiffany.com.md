Dear Visitor: 

We want you to know how we handle the information you send us via the internet. Our Privacy Policy adapts to the internet's dynamic environment. We keep you informed by updating this Privacy Policy as our procedures change. Please review it occasionally to remain informed. This Policy was last updated on May 11, 2005. This is the way we handle information: 

Automatic Collection  
Our Web server automatically recognizes the visitor's domain name (not the e-mail address) and records the visitor's browser and platform type (e.g., Netscape browser on a Microsoft platform). 

Cookies  
We use cookies to:  
\- Record the visitor's session information (such as the visitor's shopping selections when ordering).  
\- Record user-specific information on the pages the visitor selects for viewing,  
\- Retain the country of our site that you last visited. 

E-mail Addresses  
When a visitor gives us an e-mail address while placing an order, or when visitors send us e-mail correspondence, we retain the visitor's e-mail address. However, we do not share our e-mail lists. We contact visitors by their e-mail address to confirm an online order, notify that an order has been shipped, or respond to a sender's e-mail query. 

Visitor-Keyed Information  
We retain information provided by our visitor, such as registration information, transaction information (e.g., dates on which customers made purchases, amounts and types of purchases) and contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number). [Click here](https://web.archive.org/service/your_online_acct_sign_in.asp?from=service&mysid1=3BCB9581945B4872A61AD78FED623721&cntry1=-1) to access this information. 

Our visitor also has the ability to correct inaccuracies in contact information and unique identifiers. To do so, [click here](https://web.archive.org/service/your_online_acct_sign_in.asp?from=service&mysid1=3BCB9581945B4872A61AD78FED623721&cntry1=-1). 

On request with verification, we will give the visitor a reminder with unique identifier information (e.g., customer number or password). 

Mailing Addresses  
If you request a catalogue be mailed to your postal address, you will be placed on our mailing list and you will receive periodic mailings from us. If you purchase through our catalog, you may also receive mailings from other carefully screened companies to whom we may make such mailing lists available. (These lists do not include Tiffany & Co. charge card account holders). If you prefer, you can have your name put on our do-not-share list by writing to us at our address above. Please include your name and address as it appears on your mailing label. 

Telephone Numbers  
Visitors who give us their telephone numbers online will receive telephone contact from our representatives regarding orders or requests they have placed online. You may be contacted by one of our representatives to conduct research with regard to your satisfaction with our service. Your participation is voluntary and you may opt out at any time by telephoning us at 1-800-843-3269. 

Ad Servers  
Tiffany & Co. does not have arrangements with any ad server companies for this Web site. 

Security  
We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving customer data exchanged with our site server. All other data transfer is conducted through a secure phone line. 

Bridal Registry Customers  
Tiffany & Co. Bridal Registry registrants may elect to have their Tiffany & Co. Registry available on WeddingChannel.com, the premier wedding Web site. The information provided by registrants is transmitted via secure phone line to WeddingChannel.com. The WeddingChannel.com Privacy Policy may treat that information differently than outlined above. 

Children's Online Privacy  
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act took effect April 21, 2000 and pertains to Web sites directed toward children under 13 years of age. Tiffany.com does not collect information on any person under 13 years. We ask that children do not submit information to us without the consent of a parent or guardian. 

Disclosure  
If required by law, court order or in the good faith belief that disclosure is otherwise advisable, we may disclose your information.
