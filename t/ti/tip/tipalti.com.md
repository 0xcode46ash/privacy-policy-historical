Your Personal Information is securely stored by our third party cloud storage service providers.   **Please remember however that communications over the Internet are not always secure.

Our third party cloud service providers will only access, process, transfer, and store your Personal Information in accordance with this Policy.  Our providers protect your Personal Information by employing several security features including:

  * Using encryption technology as appropriate; 
  * Using appropriate network access control technology to limit access to the systems on which your Personal Information is stored; 
  * Routinely conducting internal and external security checks and penetration tests on the IT systems; and
  * Monitoring for possible vulnerabilities and attacks.



We retain Personal Information only so long as is needed in order to meet the purposes set out in this Policy, including for the purpose of enabling us to meet any legal or regulatory requirements. We have retention policies in place that govern the destruction of Personal Information.

This Site is not intended for use by children. To use the Services, you must be have attained the age of majority in your state/province/country of residence. If you are under the legal age to form a binding contract in the jurisdiction in which you are located, you may only use the Service under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who has agreed to any agreement you enter into while using the Service, including the terms of this Policy. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from minors and do not wish to do so.

By using and accessing our Site and/or our Services, you agree and consent to the transfer to and processing of Personal Information on servers located in the United States, even if you are a resident/citizen of countries and jurisdictions outside of the United States, and that the protection of such information may be different than required under the laws of your residence or location.  This includes transfers between you and us as well as with other third parties as described in this Policy. We will take the necessary measures to ensure protection of your Personal Information collected through the Services in accordance with applicable data privacy laws.

## **_Your European Economic Area Privacy Rights_**

Information about European Union residents shall be sent to the U.S., where it is processed in accordance with this Policy.  Note that if you are a Payee, the data controller in respect of your Personal Information is a Payer.  As set out above, Payers use the Services to process Personal Information that they collect from Payees for their own purposes. In this respect we act as data processor for the Payer, who will have its own Privacy Policy explaining how it uses the Payees’ Personal Information.

Your profile is maintained on databases in the U.S.  Your Personal Information may be processed by staff operating in the U.S. who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.  

On October 6, 2015, the European Court of Justice issued a judgment that declared invalid the European Commission’s Decision 2000/520/EC of 26 July 2000 “on the adequacy of the protection provided by the safe harbor privacy principles,” (“ **Safe Harbor** ”). Safe Harbor permitted transfers of EU residents’ Personal Information to the United States and ensured that the information was legally protected at an adequate level by EU standards. Since the judgment was issued, the European Union and U.S. have been in negotiations to determine a path forward for Safe Harbor.  At the time that this Policy was revised, the information regarding such path was not yet available. In light of the judgment, Tipalti has executed ‘standard contractual clauses’ with its EU subsidiaries and suppliers who collect and export Personal Information in order to allow transfers and the continued protection of EU residents’ data during the interim period while we await further guidance from the European Commission. When we receive formal written complaints related to Personal Information and privacy matters, it is our policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of Personal Information that cannot be resolved between Tipalti and an individual. 

**_For Payees:_** Please contact your Payer if you have any questions, comments or requests.  Where available, please refer to your Payer’s privacy policy for guidance.
