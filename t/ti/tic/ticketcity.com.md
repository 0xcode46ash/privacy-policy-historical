TicketCity values and protects our clients' privacy. This policy applies to all information collected or submitted to TicketCity – whether by the internet, phone, email, or in-person.

  * Billing address
  * Email address
  * Phone number
  * Credit card information

The information we collect is used only to complete your order or provide you information you have requested. We do not provide this information for use by any third parties, except to the extent necessary to complete your order.

We sell gift cards that you can personalize when you order for someone else. The information you provide for those purposes is used only to create the gift card, and we do not disclose that information to any other persons or organizations.

For website inquiries, we use your email address to answer email requests. Unless you have also opted to receive email marketing messages, we do not use those email addresses for any other purpose and are they not provided for use to any third parties.

If you select to receive marketing messages via standard mail and/or email, we use your physical street address and/or email address only for the purpose of delivering the requested TicketCity marketing messages to you. These are solely opt-in services, and it is your choice to sign up and receive information. We use the information you submit only to inform you about our products and services and you can opt out at any time.  We have strict email marketing standards and abide by all laws and best practices regarding spam avoidance. We do not provide your information for use by any third parties.

We also use information on website traffic and trends to improve the overall user experience for TicketCity customers on our website. We do not provide personal information for use by any third parties.

Finally, we do not use or share personal information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing an opportunity to opt out.

To prevent unauthorized access and maintain accurate data on our website, we have stringent physical, electronic, and management procedures in place to safeguard purchasing and to ensure that the information we collect is always secure.
