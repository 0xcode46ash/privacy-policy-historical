This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for Tickbox.net. 

**If you feel that Tickbox.net is not abiding by its posted privacy policy, you should immediately contact**[ **privacy@tickbox.net**](mailto:privacy@tickbox.net) **by email to resolve your concerns.**

**Information Collection and Use**

Tickbox.net is a trading name of markettiers4dc Limited who is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Tickbox.net collects information from our users at several different points on our web site. 

**Registration**

In order to use this web site, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user about the services and promotions on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as income level) but encouraged so we can provide a more personalised experience on our site. 

**Log Files**

We use IP addresses to analyse trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Sharing**

We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

We use outside shipping companies to ship orders or prizes. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

On occasions we partner with other parties to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. 

**Links**

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Tickbox.net is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site. 

**Newsletter**

If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. 

**Surveys & Contests **

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as postcode, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of market research or monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 

**Tell-A-Friend**

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Tickbox.net will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. Tickbox.net stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact Tickbox.net at [www.tickbox.net ](http://www.tickbox.net/) to request the removal of this information from their database. 

**Security**

This web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, your information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information we do everything in our power to protect user-information online and off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, an account handler or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected log-in screens to gain entry to restricted information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment. 

**Supplementation of Information**

In order for this web site to enhance its ability to tailor the site to an individual's preference, we combine information about the preferences and habits of users with similar information from our partners to create personalised user profiles. 

**Special Offers**

We send all new members a welcoming email to verify registration. Established members will occasionally receive information on special deals and promotions. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below. 

**Site and Service Updates**

We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their preferences. 

**Correction/Updating Personal Information:**

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your postcode), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavour to provide a way to correct or update that user's personal data provided to us. This can usually be done once logged in members can change their details through the "View/Edit my profile" option or by emailing our Customer Support ([support@tickbox.net](mailto:support@tickbox.net)). If a member wishes to be removed from our mailing list they can do so by emailing our Customer Support (support@tickbox.net). 

**Choice/Opt-in**

Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-in' to have their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, one of our surveys may have an 'opt-in' mechanism so users can receive relevant information or marketing materials from our partners. 

Users who no longer wish to receive our promotional materials, or newsletter may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at [support@tickbox.net ](mailto:support@tickbox.net)

Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not. 

**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
