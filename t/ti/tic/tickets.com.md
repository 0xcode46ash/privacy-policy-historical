# Tickets.com - Privacy Statement

ticket·privacyTM

Tickets.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in California (the "Company"), created ticket·privacyTM in order to demonstrate the Company's firm commitment to your privacy and privacy-related concerns. The following sets forth the Company's information gathering, use and dissemination practices.

The Company does not collect personal information -- names, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses or credit card numbers -- about you except when you specifically provide such information on a voluntary basis; like, for instance, when you purchase travel, sports or entertainment tickets, or make inquiries about ticket or reservation availability. The Company, in turn, utilizes your personal information in several discrete ways.

  1. If you are purchasing sports or entertainment tickets, the Company utilizes your personal information to communicate with you about your ticket order or ticket inquiry. Also, as is always the case whenever you buy a ticket to a sports or entertainment event, the hosting venue is entitled to know the name and address of all who purchased a ticket. The Company has no control whatsoever over a given venue's use of that information.

  2. If you are purchasing travel tickets, the Company utilizes your personal information to communicate with you about your travel plans, and the Company's in-house travel agency also provides information about you to airlines, rental car companies, hotels, and cruise lines, etc., in order to consummate your travel plans.

  3. As a valued customer of Tickets.com the Company will occasionally contact you, typically by e-mail (or any other way you prefer) in order to notify you of special ticketing promotions, and up-to-date news, custom-tailored to your personal travel, sports, and entertainment interests. Of course, if you do not wish to receive this personalized information, you can always let us know by e-mailing us at [customerservices@tickets.com](mailto:customerservices@tickets.com), and we will happily abide by your wishes.

  4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company reserves the right to contact you, utilizing your personal information, to inform you of information that might affect your travel, sports or entertainment experience.




The Company does not sell or rent personal information about its customers to any third parties at this time. In the event the Company does engage in such commerce in the future, you will have an opportunity to remove yourself from any such lists prior to your inclusion therein by emailing us at [customerservices@tickets.com](mailto:customerservices@tickets.com). The Company does, however, perform statistical analysis of customer usage in order to measure interest in, and use of, the various parts of the Company's web site, and the Company shares that information with current and prospective advertisers, and other interested third parties. But, this information is aggregated data only (statistics, etc.), and contains no personally identifiable information whatsoever.

Tickets.com users should be aware that if they voluntarily disclose personal information in chat areas, on bulletin boards, or in classified areas within the Company's web site, that information might be collected and disseminated by third-parties, and result in, among other things, unsolicited inquiries, messages, and offers from third-parties. This third-party conduct is out of the control of the Company.

The Company uses your Internet Protocol (IP) address to help diagnose problems with our computer server, and to administer our web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you, and to gather broad demographic data. Your IP address contains no personal information about you.

Tickets.com users should be aware that non-personal information and data may be automatically collected by virtue of the standard operation of the Company computer servers or through the use of "cookies". Cookies are files a web site can use to recognize repeat users, and allow a web site to track web usage behavior. Cookies take up minimal room on your computer and cannot damage your computer’s files. Cookies work by assigning a number to the user that has no meaning outside of the assigning web site. Users should be aware that the Company cannot control the use of cookies (or the resulting information) by the Company's advertisers or third-party partners. If you do not want information to be collected through the use of cookies, your browser allows you to deny or accept the use of cookies. There may, however, be some features on the Company's web site which require the use of cookies in order to customize the delivery of information to you.

The Company takes your privacy concerns very seriously. If you still have concerns about privacy issues after reading ticket·privacy, please contact us at [privacy@tickets.com](mailto:privacy@tickets.com).

ticket·privacyTM is effective as of July 1, 1998. ticket·privacy is not intended to and does not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.
