Data Protection in Australia

Back to [Australia's home page](https://web.archive.org/australia)

The Commonwealth Privacy Act 1998 implements strict privacy protection which Commonwealth and government agencies must observe when collecting, storing, using and disclosing personal information. Other Commonwealth laws contain privacy provisions relating to information about health insurance claims, data matching, information about old criminal convictions and personal information disclosed by telecommunications companies. The Privacy Act applies to the private sector only with respect to tax file numbers and consumer credit information. The Federal Privacy Commissioner has encouraged Australian businesses to develop voluntary industry codes of conduct to meet privacy standards. In February 1998, the Commissioner issued a document entitled "National Principles for the Fair Handling of Personal Information." The National Principles are based on the OECD Guidelines. These Principles address the collection, use, and disclosure of data; data quality and security; openness, access and correction; identifiers, anonymity, trans-border data flows and sensitive information. In December 1998, the Federal Government announced that it intends to enact legislation to strengthen self-regulatory privacy protection in the private sector. They also announced that the legislation that will be introduced would be based on the National Principles. The Company is committed to adherence to industry codes of conduct and/or legislation that will be required to process data in Australia and respects the privacy rights of the citizens of Australia.

Privacy in the Netherlands

Back to [Netherlands' homepage](http://www.nl.tickets.com/)

The Netherlands enacted the Data Protection Act (DPA or the Act) on July 1, 1989\. The DPA promotes self-regulation, and provides consumers with certain rights, including notice, access to information, disclosure and correction of inaccuracies. It requires those in control of personal data files to take measures to assure only authorized disclosures and ensure informational accuracy. Lastly, the DPA allows consumers to seek and obtain compensation for damages. The Act applies to personal data files relating to living individuals. Collection of data for personal or private use is excluded from its provisions. When certain requirements are met, a corporation may bring an action under the Act's provisions, however, the Act itself does not apply to data concerning corporations. 

The Act creates the Chamber of Registration which is responsible for:

  * monitoring privacy development 
  * advising the cabinet on privacy matters 
  * enforcing the provisions of the Act 



Your Rights as the Consumer

A consumer must be informed of the collection of data within one month in writing. Notice must contain the following:

  * purpose of the file 
  * name and address of file controller 



A consumer must be informed of their right to question the existence, accuracy, and origin of data. 

Information Bureaus 

Information bureaus may gather information that affects the rights of consumer'ss. For example, a credit bureau may gather information relating to a consumer's's creditworthiness. Consent is required for the issuance and dissemination of such information and such consent must be in writing. Data may be issued to a third party if in conjunction with the purpose of the file, on request for research or statistical purposes, or "on the grounds of urgent and important considerations." The Act applies to all civilian collections of personal data, regardless of residency status in the Netherlands. It also applies to foreign files having a Dutch file controller and containing personal data about Netherlands residents. There are certain limited exemptions that may be granted in trans-border data dissemination, however, exemptions are only granted to those countries with adequate data protection laws. The Act limits access to foreign data files dictated by a foreign controller. A total ban on the transfer of data can be issued if it is established that the privacy of an individual in threatened.

Privacy in Canada

Back to [Canada's homepage](https://web.archive.org/canada)

The Canadian government passed two acts, the Access to Information Act ("AIA") and the Privacy Act on July 1, 1983 to balance the need for data processing with the competing interests of Canadian citizens for protection of their privacy. Although the AIA received more media attention, it is the Privacy Act that guarantees citizens the right to privacy.

The Privacy Act - General Provisions 

The Privacy Act ensures the right of every Canadian citizen and permanent resident: 

  1. to know (with certain exceptions) of the existence of files relating to him or her 
  2. to be able to examine, challenge and correct any information 
  3. to know the purposes of the information collected 
  4. to be consulted as to future use of any information 



Personal information is deemed to include:

  1. race, ethnic origin, religion, age or marital status; 
  2. educational, medical, employment, criminal or bank records;
  3. address, fingerprints, blood type or any identifying number relating to the individual; 
  4. another individual's opinion about the individual; 
  5. the individual's opinions on proposals for a grant; 
  6. correspondence with a government institution; or 
  7. the individual's name, if attached to any personal information.

Privacy in Hong Kong

Hong Kong enacted the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Ordinance) which entered into force December 20, 1996. The Privacy Commission Office is an independent statutory body set up to oversee the enforcement of the Ordinance. The Ordinance has as its core purpose the protection of privacy interests of living, identifiable individuals in relation to personal data. It also contributes to Hong Kong's continued economic well being by safeguarding the free flow of personal data to Hong Kong from restrictions by countries that already have data protection laws. The Ordinance binds the government to ensure the protection of privacy rights of its citizens. Where there is a conflict between the Ordinance and any other legislative action or ordinance, the Privacy Ordinance takes precedence. The Ordinance states its mission as: "A data user shall not do an act, or engage in a practice, that contravenes data protection principle unless the act or practice, as the case may be, is required or permitted under this Ordinance."

The Ordinance provides certain rights to consumers including:

  * access 
  * correction or erasure 
  * copies of information held 
  * complaint procedures for denial of access and 
  * compensation for damages suffered as a result of unauthorized disclosure or misuse. 



Consumers must be informed of: the rights and obligations of compliance; penalties or consequences for failure to do so; purpose of the data collection; any anticipated third party disclosure; and rights of access and correction. Personal data should not be kept longer than necessary to the fulfillment of the purpose for which they are collected 

Data transferred to Hong Kong from other jurisdictions will generally become subject to the requirements of the Ordinance. Section 33 of the Ordinance regulates the transfer of data out of Hong Kong. This section provides for an equivalence test of protection, rather than the adequacy test of the EU Directive. It permits transfers to jurisdictions lacking a data privacy regime where the interests of the consumer are otherwise adequately protected. Examples are where consent has been obtained or there are contractual assurances in place that the data protection principles will be respected.

Privacy in Germany

Back to [Germany's homepage](http://www.de.tickets.com/)

Data protection in Germany has come in two phases. The Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) was adopted January 27, 1977. The major provisions came into force January 1, 1978 and the technical and organizational measures became effective on January 1, 1979. The BDSG was then replaced in 1991 by a new data protection act which took advantage of the experiences and technical improvements of the previous years as well as judicial opinions of the Federal Constitutional court.. Data protection in Germany centers around important concepts of general privacy, human rights and the balance between access to information and privacy concerns. Basically, the German data protection law embodies "informationelles Selbstbestimmungsrecht" -- the basic right of the individual to decide on the use and communication of his or her personal data. This tenet is paramount, with the caveat of overriding social or public concerns. The main purpose of the Act is to "protect the individual against his right to privacy being impaired through the handling of his personal data." The Act states that the "processing and use of personal data shall be admissible only if this Act or any other legal provision permits or prescribes them or the consumer's has consented." But the Act may be superseded by the interests of the state. The Act states that insofar as "other legal provisions of the Federation are applicable to personal data, including their publication, such provisions shall take precedence over the provisions of this Act." 

Personal data is defined as "any information concerning the personal or material circumstances of an identified or identifiable individual." Dissemination of personal data to third persons is limited but permissible, as long as there is no threat of harm to the consumer's or his interests.

A consumer has the right of notification of collection of data, notification of content, purpose and identity of recipients and the rights of correction, erasure or blocking. Blocking is defined as the labeling of stored personal data so as to restrict further processing or use. This information must be transmitted to the consumer in writing and free of charge. If a file controller refuses access, a consumer's has the right to appeal to the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection. In general, communication and storage of data is permissible if the business has identifiable and justifiable interests. There are no restrictions, for instance, on information regarding membership in a group, occupation, birth year, name, title, academic degree or address. These categories are not sensitive by their nature and may be of legitimate interest or use of a file controller. Restrictions do apply to sensitive data relating to health, criminal offenses, administrative offenses, or religious or political convictions.

Privacy in Belgium

Back to [Belgium's homepage](http://www.be.tickets.com/)

Belgium enacted the Belgium Data Protection Act (BDPA) on December 8, 1992, to ensure that personal data may only be processed for clearly described and justified purposes and may not be used in a manner incompatible with these purposes. 

With regard to sensitive personal data, there are more specific, more stringent rules that must be observed by the file controller. These rules apply to three categories of personal data: highly sensitive, medical and judicial data. Highly sensitive data refers to information on the subject's race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or behavior, political activity or opinion, religious and philosophical beliefs and membership in labor unions. Appropriate groups may, of course, keep membership lists.

The consumer's has the right to information, access, correction or deletion of inaccurate or illegally stored data, appeal and information about these rights. The BDPA refers to information collected both directly from and indirectly about the consumer's. This applies to all consumers in Belgium, including foreign consumers, even when further processing occurs outside of Belgium.

The consumer's has the right to access information directly or through the Privacy Commission. For direct access, the consumer's must submit a written request to the company and can be charged a fee. The company must respond within 45 days with the information. A consumer has a right to correct any misinformation collected free of charge. They must submit a request to the company who must respond within one month and inform any consumer of the correction or deletion. The company must keep the identity of any third consumer for at least one year. A consumer's has the right to appeal any adverse decision through a complaint to the Privacy Commission or before the Chairman of the Court of First Instance. A consumer has the right to be informed of these rights and their methods of exercise. The BDPA doesn't explicitly prohibit or restrict the merging of personal data from different

Privacy in Italy

Italy enacted the Processing of Personal Data Act (the Act) in September, 1993\. The Act is designed to "ensure that the processing of personal data is carried out by respecting the rights, fundamental freedoms and dignity of natural persons, especially as related to privacy and personal identity..." Personal data is defined under the Act as "any information relating to natural or legal persons, bodies or associations that are or can be identified, even indirectly, by reference to any other information including by a personal identification number..." The law applies to the processing of personal data carried out by any person on Italian soil. It does not apply to data collected for purely personal use, provided that the data are not intended for systematic communication or dissemination. The Act applies to the processing, "on the State's territory, of personal data kept in a foreign country."

All data collected must be:

  * Processed lawfully and fairly 
  * Collected and recorded for specific purposes 
  * Accurate and, when necessary, kept up to date 
  * Adequate, relevant and not excessive to the stated purpose of collection 
  * Kept in a form that permits identification of the consumer for no longer than is necessary for the purpose of collection. 



A consumer has certain rights in regard to the collection of data including: 

  * The purpose of collection 
  * An opt in for data collection 
  * The consequences for failure to provide data 
  * Any third party transmission anticipated 
  * The name, denomination or trade name, domicile, residence or registered office of the company processing and/or storing the data

Privacy in Denmark

Unlike the other Scandinavian countries, Denmark has passed two acts relative to the protection of privacy and access to information: the Private Registers Act and the Public Registers Act. These acts were adopted by the Danish Folkerting (Parliament) in 1978 and became law January 1, 1979. Amendments were made in 1987. The acts affect "personal data" defined as "data that are referable to identifiable individuals even if such referral presupposes knowledge of the personal registration number or any particular means of identification of such individual." Personal data is data that permit, in any form, directly or indirectly, the identification of the natural persons to which they relate, irrespective of whether the processing is done by a natural or legal person. 

A consumer now has the right to know what is registered about him and may submit a request of access once every 12 months. Response must be within four weeks and complaints regarding denial or delay are made to the DSA. 

Tickets.com will ensure that: 

  * The purposes of data collection and processing are being clearly specified
  * Only information that is relevant and necessary for the original purpose is being processed 
  * Our customers will be able to contact us to obtain what information we are storing to determine that the information is up to date and accurate 
  * Personal information is not kept any longer than required 



Personal information will only be processed with the your consent. You are entitled to withdraw consent at any time. 

Personal information may be transferred to other countries. The Company will obtain approval from the DSA prior to any transfer so that the DSA can determine if that country can secure adequate data protection. Adequate protection will be decided based on the type of data to be transferred, the purpose of the transfer, the country of (the data's) origin, the country of (the data's) destination, as well as data protection rules and guidelines in place in the receiving country. Data may be transferred with the your consent if the transfer is considered necessary for the completion of a purchase on our site.

In addition, Danish regulatory authorities may permit the transfer of personal data to countries lacking adequate protection, if the data controller can provide satisfactory guarantees for the protection of the data subject. The regulatory authorities will notify the European Commission and the EU member states about any data transfers under the latter rule. 

Our Obligations to You and Your Rights 

We are committed to protecting your right to privacy. We have demonstrated this commitment by agreeing to the following:

  * We will always inform you is collecting and processing the data you provide
  * We will always inform you about the purpose for which the data is being processed 
  * We will try to provide additional information that the Company determines necessary to protect your rights
