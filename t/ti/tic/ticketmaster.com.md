# Ticketmaster Online Privacy Policy

**Does Ticketmaster Online collect personal information?**  


Ticketmaster Online collects user names, e-mail addresses, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, event preferences and other personal information when you purchase tickets or merchandise or when you sign up for our services, such as the My Ticketmaster website. We also ask for certain personal information at other times, such as when you enter sweepstakes or promotions sponsored by Ticketmaster Online and/or our partners. 

**How does Ticketmaster Online use this information?**

Ticketmaster Online uses the information in a number of different ways:   
(A) Your e-mail address is stored so that we can send you your user name and password in case you forget or lose it (applicable only to MyTM users). It may also be used to send special announcements and notifications of events, products or services that might be of interest to you (such as, sweepstakes, contests, promotions, gift certificates, give-aways, merchandise offerings, etc.). 

(B) Your mailing address is stored for several reasons. First (for those who have personalized their site), so that we can pre-enter it into your invoice form during the ticket-purchasing process. This will expedite ordering since you will not have to enter any of the information again. Your mailing address is needed so that Ticketmaster or the venue can mail your tickets to your home. Your mailing address is also needed to verify and authorize your credit card during your purchase. Additionally, from time to time in connection with certain campaigns and programs administered by us, we may send special announcements and notifications of events, products and services that might be of interest to you (such as, sweepstakes, contests, promotions, gift certificates, give-aways, merchandise offerings, etc.). 

(C) Information on your event and regional preferences is collected to dynamically assemble an individually unique group of event listings on the My Ticketmaster website which will be relevant to your specific tastes. (Refers to MYTM users only.) 

(D) The personal information we collect is also used to deliver targeted messages to those users we feel might be interested in specific announcements and notifications of events, products or services (such as, sweepstakes, contests, promotions, gift certificates, give-aways, merchandise offerings, etc.). An added benefit of being a Ticketmaster Online Internet user is that you will receive timely information about unique and exciting marketing and promotional opportunities. 

(E) Finally, your habits within this site may be used to help us recommend events to you that people with similar habits enjoy. 

**Will Ticketmaster Online share this information with other parties?**

(A) E-mail address: From time to time, we might share your e-mail address with venues where events occur, with promoters of events and with certain of our third party partners. The venue, promoter or third party partner might send you special announcements and notifications of events, products or services that might be of interest to you (such as, sweepstakes, contests, promotions, gift certificates, give-aways, merchandise offerings, etc.). 

(B) Mailing address/telephone number: Your mailing address will be shared with your credit card company in order to verify that you are an authorized user. It will also be shared with the venue or promoter of the ticketed event in order for them to mail your tickets or event information to you. Your telephone number will be used if there are any customer service issues that might need to be addressed. Additionally, from time to time in connection with certain campaigns and programs administered by us, we may conduct telemarketing activities and you may be contacted by telephone to be advised of special announcements and notifications of events, products or services (such as, sweepstakes, contests, promotions, gift certificates, give-aways, merchandise offerings, etc.). 

(C) Credit card information: Ticketmaster will never share your credit card number with any third parties. 

(D) User demographic/psychographic information: Your specific user demographic/psychographic information will not be shared with anybody, unless we believe in good faith that the law requires it, or to protect the rights or property of Ticketmaster. While your individual user demographic/psychographic information will not be shared, from time to time, collective and aggregated user demographic/psychographic information will be disclosed in order to describe our services and user demographics/psychographics to prospective advertisers, partners, research companies and other third parties so they can target their messages to a specific audience (for example, 25-30 year old women residing on the East Coast) and conduct requested research studies on our behalf. 

(E) User habits: Your specific user habits within our site will not be disclosed to any third parties. 

**What are cookies?**

Cookies are pieces of data that are sent to your browser. When you browse the site that originally set the cookie, the contents of the cookie are sent back to the site. This allows the site to easily keep track of information specific to you, such as which personalized information should be displayed. Cookies may be saved to your hard drive, or may only last until you close your browser. 

**How are cookies used?**

We use cookies in a number of ways. For example, we use cookies to identify your My Ticketmaster account. You may choose to save this cookie to your hard drive, so that you will not have to re-enter your user identification and password. Cookies are also used in the ticketing process to streamline the process and make sure that you get the right tickets. Additionally, consistent with standard practices in the Internet industry, you may occasionally receive cookies from advertisers on our site. Ticketmaster does not control these cookies, and they are not subject to our privacy policy. 

**Are children protected?**

Naturally, the safety and protection of children is very important to us. Children should always have permission from a parent before using this site and before submitting personal information. 

**What else should I know about my privacy?**

Ticketmaster uses reasonable precautions to keep the personal information disclosed to us secure and to disclose such information only to third parties we believe to be responsible. However, our partners and third party Internet sites and services which are accessible through our site, or parties whom we inform you are collecting data in connection with sweepstakes, promotions and other activities, have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of us. We have no responsibility or liability for any actions of any third parties which receive the information. 

By using this site, you signify your assent to the Ticketmaster Online Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use this site. We reserve the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of this site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
