TicketsAtWork.com is owned and operated by Entertainment Benefits Group, Inc. /EBG. Privacy is of the utmost importance to EBG. And as such we have drafted a privacy policy that clearly states what will and will not be done with all personal information.

The intent of this privacy policy is to detail the information EBG may gather about individuals who visit its Web sites, how that information is used, and its disclosure practices. Please note that this policy applies only to EBG's websites and not to the Web sites of our partners, other companies, or organizations to which we provide links. 

**Your Personal Information** We do not collect personal information when you visit our site unless you complete an optional registration, submit a survey, or enter a contest. If you do register, submit a survey or enter a contest, it is Entertainment Benefits Group, Inc.'s, practice never to disclose any of your personal information to third parties. When providing personal information, we may ask for contact information such as name, postal address and email address. With your permission, we will use this contact information to send newsletters, information about EBG or other promotional materials. You always have the option of discontinuing future mailings. To do so, please contact the company directly by using the information found in the "Contact Us" section below, or simply follow the link provided in any mailing. 

We use email links or Web forms throughout our site for customer comments and suggestions. We will make every effort to respond to your questions or comments in a prompt manner. Any information we collect from emails or Web forms is used for the purpose of responding to the questions or comments. We may also file your comments to improve the site and program, or review and discard the information. 

EBG is fully committed to protecting your personal information. We do not by practice share, sell, or rent any information you provide to us to any unaffiliated third party. EBG may disclose aggregate data and statistics in order to describe our site and services to prospective partners, co-branded partners, advertisers and other third parties, or other lawful purposes. We do not use your mailing address information for unsolicited marketing unless we either have your permission or believe in good faith that the law requires it. 

**Third Parties** WDWSpecials.com has partnerships with third parties who may provide you with a variety of services if you have signed up for them. As a part of these partnerships, any information you provide directly to that third party in connection with these services is covered by the privacy practices of that third party. EBG recommends you consult the privacy policies of our third party partners prior to providing any personal information. 

**Purchases** When you place an order on WDWSpecials.com and any sites located on the domain with a co-branded domain, we will ask you for the following personal information: name, email address, mailing address, phone number, credit card number and its expiration date. This information is transmitted via a secure encrypted server using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, the approved industry standard (see Security section below). If necessary, we will use your personal information to contact you for account purposes. 

**Contests or Surveys** In the case of promotions or surveys, personal data will be collected. Such surveys or contests may ask you for personal information, which may include demographic details (e.g., ZIP code, age or income level).

This information is also collected for the purpose of verifying eligibility and in some case entrant preferences.

We will post changes prominently so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. If there is a change in the way we use your personal information, we will notify you via written or email notice of those changes and post the changes in our privacy statement a minimum of 30 days prior to the change taking effect.
