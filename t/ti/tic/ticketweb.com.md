# TicketWeb - Privacy Information

TicketWeb is committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you only to process orders. We do not sell or disclose any information that identifies you to a third party. Our clients, the people who put on the events that for which you buy tickets, also have access to your information since you are both our customer as well as their customer. As part of our contract with them we forbid them from selling or disclosing your information to any third party. If for some reason you find that this has not been the case, please contact us immediately. We are very sensitive to this issue and, as a pro-consumer company, seek to always protect our customers.

In addition, when you place an order with TicketWeb your personal information and credit card information are safe. Please read on for more details about our privacy policy.

 **What information do we collect?**  
When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address and you credit card number and expiration date. This allows us to process and fill your order and to notify you of your order status. The Company uses your Internet Protocol (IP) address to help diagnose problems with our computer server, and to administer our web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you, and to gather broad demographic data. Your IP address contains no personal information about you. Our site may contain links to other sites. TicketWeb is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.  
  
**How does TicketWeb protect customer information?**  
When you place orders or access your account information, we make use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. In addition, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. 

**How does TicketWeb use "cookies"?**  
"Cookies" are small text files a web site can use to recognize repeat users and facilitate a user's ongoing access to and use of the site. We do not use cookies to retrieve personal information from your computer. We use cookies to track your shopping cart, allowing you to buy tickets to several events. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to reject them.  
  
**Will TicketWeb sell my information?**  
TicketWeb does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. We are privacy fanatics! As such, TicketWeb does not ask users to sign in, create a screen name or create a password to buy tickets. TicketWeb does not collect e-mail addresses and does not use user information for any purpose other than selling, mailing and checking on ticket orders. TicketWeb may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. TicketWeb has several clients who have merchant accounts. This means that they process their own credit card orders. On the final order page, the button will either say, "I agree to pay TicketWeb," or "I agree to pay (venue's name)." If a venue's name is on the button and not TicketWeb, that venue uses its own merchant account to process orders and gathers your personal information. TicketWeb cannot control what they do with that information, and users should check the privacy policy for those venues.
