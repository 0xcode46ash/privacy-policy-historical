# Privacy Policy

Here at Ticket Monster, we are committed to our fans. We are passionate about the game, but even more obsessed with providing you the most reliable purchasing experience on the market. In short, this boils down to one thing: protecting your privacy. Allow us to explain:

This privacy policy describes our practices regarding personal and account information that is collected through our Website, located at www.ticketmonster.com In this policy, "personal and account information" is referring to your name, company name, account information, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and any other identification which may identify you (i.e.: industry, profession, size of company, past purchase history).

Please rest assured that if at any moment in time, we decide to change any detail of our privacy policy, we will alert you. The homepage of Ticket Monster, as well as any other pages we deem appropriate will be updated accordingly. You are our top priority and we guarantee that you will always know what information is collected and how it is used, if at all. We are committed to 100% transparency.

Keep in mind that we have the legal right to modify our privacy policy as needed at any time, so please be sure to review it frequently, and always before making your next purchase. If ever material changes are made, we will communicate that to all of our customers.

### When you are on the site:

In order to make a purchase through our Web Site, you must provide us with your name, billing address, and credit card number, expiration of the card, and security code.

If you are simply browsing our site and do not go through with buying any of our unbelievably priced tickets, we still collect your IP address, in an effort to measure our site traffic and help provide a relevant shopping experience.

If you come to our site through an intermediary, we track the location of the link that referred you. 

In any situation, we observe what kind of browser you use so that we can optimize our website for future visitors. We also follow what pages you visit once on the site to better understand navigation habits.

### For Frequent Fans & Buyers:

Once you create an account on Ticket Monster, we will need access to your name, e-mail address, home address, phone number, zip code and password. Please keep in mind, protecting your privacy is crucial to us, so do not give out your account password to anyone. No, not even to your best friend or puppy.

If you choose to subscribe to our newsletter (which you should, it's awesome), we store both your e-mail and home address so that we can send you all kinds of promotional offers. You may unsubscribe at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link located at the bottom of every e-mail.

When you chat with a representative online, we collect your e-mail address and any other order information that might be needed to respond to your question/concern and provide a hassle-free shopping experience.
