We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our web Site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you.

|  | **Cookies**  
Our site uses cookies to keep track of what you have purchased. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our Site, and for other purposes relating to your transactions on the Site.

|  | **Information We Request Directly From You**  
Our Site's registration forms, order forms, surveys and contests require you to give us contact information (like your name and email address), occasionally, unique identifiers (like your Social Insurance Number), and demographic information (like your postal code, age, or income level).

|  | **How We Use Contact Information**  
Your contact information is used to contact you when necessary in connection with transactions entered into by you on our Site. Your contact information is provided to the venues and selected promoters of concerts and events for which you purchase tickets. We also use customer contact information we collect in order to send you information and offers from our company and promotional material from some of our partners. We carefully select the information we send and make sure that it offers real value to you, such as discounts, exclusive offers or special event information.

|  | **How We Use Financial Information**  
Financial information that is collected is used to check your qualifications and bill you for products and services. Unique identifiers (such as Social Insurance Numbers) are collected from you to verify your identity and for use as account numbers in our record system. We will not share financial or unique identifier information with third parties without your prior consent. When you make a purchase on the Site, your consent is given to provide your financial or contact information to those third parties necessary to process your transactions with us, such as credit card companies and the companies that handle shipping on our behalf and when you purchase products or services which we sell on behalf of third parties (such as magazine subscriptions), your consent is given to provide your financial or contact information to those third parties to process your transactions with them.
