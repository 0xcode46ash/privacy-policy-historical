Ticketmaster has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the privacy of the details that you provide us when using this web site ("Site"). **When you use the Site, you are consenting to the practices set forth in this Privacy Policy.**

### Your IP Address

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Site. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you. Your IP address may also be used to assist in the detection of fraud and we may pass this information to the police.

### Cookies

A cookie is a small file that is automatically issued to your computer when you enter our Site and which is stored by the browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies identify your computer, not the individual user of your computer. Cookies store some basic information that helps us to identify if a user of your computer has visited the Site before and if you have provided us with some personalised information. Our Site uses cookies to keep track of what you have purchased. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password (if you have supplied us with one) so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our Site, and for other purposes, such as informing you that you may have made multiple bookings for specific events on our Site. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent, but if you choose to do so you may not be able to access some areas of the Site.

### How We Use Financial Information

Financial information that is collected is used to authorise payment and bill you for products and services. When you make a purchase on the Site, your consent is given to provide your financial or personal information to those third parties necessary to process your transactions with us, such as credit card companies, banks and the companies that handle shipping on our behalf. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Except as provided above, we will not share financial information with third parties without your prior consent.

**Business Partners**  
When you purchase a ticket from Ticketmaster, you may, in connection with your purchase, be offered the opportunity to purchase related third party products or services or participate in third party promotions, schemes or reward programmes. We will not share your personal information or financial information with these third party merchants, unless you expressly choose to purchase their products or services or participate in their promotion, scheme or reward programme. Before agreeing to purchase from, or participate with, a third party merchant, please ensure that you read and understand the relevant Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy of such third party merchants (they may be different from Ticketmaster's). When, in connection with the purchase of tickets from Ticketmaster, you choose to purchase a particular third party product or service or engage in a particular third party, promotion, scheme or reward programme, you authorise us to share your name, email address and, where applicable, and only when you have consented for us to do so, your credit/debit card number and other billing information (e.g., physical address, card commencement and expiration dates, CCV security codes, etc.) with that third party merchant.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Information and Financial Information in Compliance with Laws

You should be aware that we may release your personal information or financial information when we believe it is necessary to comply with laws or regulations, to assist law enforcement, to enforce the terms under which you transacted with Ticketmaster, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Ticketmaster, users of the Site or others.

Such companies may be located outside of the European Economic Area, including in the United States, and you consent to the transfer of your personal information and financial information to such companies for the purposes set out in this paragraph. Whenever we transfer your personal information or financial information to countries outside of the European Economic Area, we will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Policy and as permitted by the UK's Data Protection Act 1998 and related legislation from time to time.

### Other Sites/Third Party Vendors and their Privacy Policies

This Site may contain links to other web sites. Ticketmaster is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites or for the privacy policies and practices of other third parties, and so you should be careful to read those web sites' privacy policies independently.
