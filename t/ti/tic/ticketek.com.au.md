# Ticketek Australia

**We Respect Your Privacy**

Ticketek respects the privacy of all our customers and business contacts, and is committed to safeguarding the personal information which you provide us. Also, Ticketek is subject to the requirements of the National Privacy Principles which are contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (the Privacy Act).

Our Privacy Policy outlines how Ticketek will handle and manage personal information about you. It applies to Ticketek and to each wholly owned subsidiary of Ticketek and to the practices of the agents and contractors engaged by Ticketek to provide goods and services. As we collect personal information online through www.ticketek.com.au (our website) and through m.ticketek.com.au (our mobile site), this Privacy Policy also applies to your use of the Ticketek website and Ticketek mobile site.

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The most current version will always be located on our website and is also available by using the contact details below.

**How is personal information collected?**

Ticketek is one of Australia's largest entertainment and sports ticketing businesses. In order to provide customers with a quality ticketing service, Ticketek offers customers the ability to purchase tickets through the following different sales channels:

  * A national call centre provides a telephone sales service.
  * In-person sales, available through a network of over 140 agencies throughout Australia and also through box offices at many premier venues.
  * Online sales are available through our website and mobile site.



These sales channels use different ways to collect personal information about Ticketek customers. Generally, the personal information is collected directly from you at the time you make a purchase, when you register as a My Ticketek member, through our website/mobile site or when you have other dealings with us.

**What personal information does Ticketek collect, and why?**

The types of personal information we collect will vary depending on your dealings with Ticketek and the products, services and benefits we (or our agents, contractors and third parties) provide to you.

If you purchase tickets from Ticketek, we need to collect personal information about you. This information may include:

  * name, address and other contact details (like your telephone number);
  * electronic addresses such as email;
  * date of birth;
  * transaction details relating to your use of our products and services; and
  * any preferences you tell us about.



Generally, we collect and use personal information about customers and My Ticketek members to provide a range of products and services. The main reason we collect this information is so we can contact you in the case of an event cancellation or to notify change of event details or replacement of lost tickets. We may also need some of this information in order to process your payment (for example, if you pay by credit card online).

We may also collect personal information to assist in identifying ways in which we can provide you with a better service, such as providing you with information regarding our products and services more effectively.

Unless you tell us otherwise, Ticketek may use personal information about you for marketing and research purposes. You can let us know about this at any time - all you need to do is contact Ticketek if you no longer wish to receive marketing material (the contact details of our Privacy Officer are below). Please note that we may still need to use your personal information to provide you with the products you have requested as a customer.

**How is personal information used and disclosed?**

Ticketek may use and disclose your personal information for a variety of purposes in connection with providing you with a product of service. Ticketek's uses of your personal information may include:

  * processing and administering your dealings with us as a customer or your membership to My Ticketek;
  * providing you with the products and services you have requested from us;
  * as detailed above, contacting you in the case of an event cancellation or to notify change of event details or replacement of lost tickets; and
  * disclosure to and use by third party contractors and service providers to help us operate our business or provide a service to you. Ticketek may disclose your personal information to third party contractors and service providers who help us operate our computer systems, send out our mail/email and clean collected data and who perform data analysis to group demographic attributes of individuals, such as “genres of likely interest”.



Ticketek does not sell personal information without your consent, Ticketek may disclose your personal information in certain limited circumstances as follows:

  * disclosure of your personal information to third party contractors and service providers who help us operate our business or provide a service to you. For example, Ticketek's contractors include companies that help Ticketek to operate our computer systems, send out our mail/email, clean collected data and perform data analysis to group demographic attributes of individuals, such as “genres of likely interest”.
  * disclosure of your contact details to venues and promoters so that they can provide you with promotional material about upcoming events, unless you tell us otherwise.
  * disclosure of your personal information to organisations related to Ticketek such as other Nine Entertainment Co. companies. This may, for example, help us ensure that information collected is accurate, complete and up-to-date and also better enable us to understand and meet your needs and interests.
  * with your consent, disclosure of your contact details to venues, promoters and other Nine Entertainment Co. group entities, so that they can provide you with special offers (refer below for further details)



If Ticketek provides your personal information to venues, promoters or other Nine Entertainment Co. entities, or engages contractors and service providers to handle personal information, we require these organisations to agree to comply with our Privacy Policy and with strict conditions governing how personal information is to be handled. Otherwise, Ticketek will only disclose personal information if this is required by law or permitted under the Privacy Act.

Note that sometimes Ticketek extracts information from our collected records to produce aggregated data. This aggregated data does not identify individuals. Ticketek uses the aggregated data for research purposes and may share the data with third parties.

**Security of personal information**

Ticketek protects the personal information it collects in a secure database, in proprietary data format, which can only be read using proprietary tools. In storing your information we have taken a number of steps to protect your personal information from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. Data collected online is stored in a Microsoft SQL database, a protected, secure data centre that is unreachable by the Internet. Ticketek encrypts data sent from your computer to our systems during Internet transactions and from customer access across networks. Ticketek also employs firewalls, intrusion detection systems and virus scanning tools to protect against unauthorised persons and viruses from entering our systems. Ticketek employees are required, as a condition of their employment, to treat personal information held by Ticketek as confidential, and to maintain the confidentiality of that personal information. They are also required to use logins and passwords when accessing Ticketek systems.

Additionally, we take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information when we no longer need it. We also impose strict requirements of security and confidentiality on all third parties as to how they store and handle your personal information.

**Anonymous transactions**

Where it is lawful and practicable to do so, customers may transact with Ticketek without providing personal information. Customers wishing to purchase without providing personal information can make a cash transaction at any of Ticketek's retail agencies. However, if we do not collect personal information about you at the point of sale, we will not be able to contact you in the case of an event cancellation or venue change, for example.

**Non-customer information**

Sometimes, Ticketek needs to collect personal information about individuals who are not customers. This will usually arise where we collect the name and business contact details of a person who is the contact in a government agency or company with whom we deal. Ticketek's policy is to only use personal information collected from non-customers for the main business purpose for which it was collected.

**Access and correction**

Under the Privacy Act, you have a right to seek access to information which Ticketek holds about you. You also have the right to ask us to correct information about you which is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date. If you are an online customer, you are able to access or correct the personal information by logging onto our website (www.ticketek.com.au). If you are not an online customer, you may access the information that Ticketek has collected about you by placing your request in writing and sending it to us using the contact details below. Please include your phone number and enclose a copy of a form of identification such as a current driver's licence or passport with your request. Ticketek's policy is to consider any requests for access or correction within 21 days of receipt.

**Transborder data flows**

Some of Ticketek's third party contractors and service providers may perform some of their services overseas. For instance, a third party contractor may utilise a server hosted overseas as a method to send emails to Ticketek customers. In all instances where this occurs, Ticketek takes reasonable steps to ensure that all personal information is handled in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.

**Online privacy issues**

To the extent that this Privacy Policy applies to online privacy issues, it is to be read as forming part of the terms of use for our website and mobile site. When you deal with Ticketek, whether online or otherwise, Ticketek takes its privacy obligations seriously. This paragraph is intended to provide more information about privacy for the users of our website and mobile site. Generally, Ticketek will handle personal information collected online consistently with the way that it handles personal information collected offline. To summarise, we will use personal information collected online to provide you with our products and services (eg to process your online purchases), to contact you in the case of an event cancellation or a change of venue, and if you agree, for marketing purposes. If Ticketek provides your personal information to venues, promoters or other Nine Entertainment Co. entities, or engages contractors and service providers to handle personal information, we require these organisations to agree to comply with our Privacy Policy and with strict conditions governing how personal information is to be handled. If you have purchased tickets for an event online, your contact details may be provided to the venue where that event is staged or the promoter who has provided the event - both of whom will act in accordance with the national privacy principles. If you have opted in to receive newsletters or special offers from Ticketek, you can choose to unsubscribe from these programs at any time via our website. If you are contacted by a venue or promoter they will also provide you with a facility by which you can opt to no longer receive communications. Other matters specific to Ticketek's handling of personal information online are set out below.

**A**. For each visitor to our website and mobile site, our server automatically recognises and stores the visitor's domain name, but not their email address. In addition, our website and mobile site use cookies. Most web browsers are set by default to accept cookies. However, if you do not wish to receive any cookies you may set your browser to either prompt or refuse cookies. Please note that rejecting cookies will disable your browser from purchasing tickets from our website or mobile site. We also use cookies for tracking the statistics of our website. This allows us to better understand our users and improve the layout and functionality of our website. This tracking is conducted in such a way to ensure the anonymity of visitors.

**B**. With your consent Ticketek may pass your personal information on to venues and promoters of events to which you have purchased tickets, to keep you informed of future events. You will be asked at the time of booking if you would like to receive this information. You may change your preference at any time directly with the organisations (venues and promoters) which have obtained your information. If you do not have their details you may contact our Privacy Officer directly.

**C**. Provision of online customer data to third parties (other than Nine Entertainment Co. entities)  
If you consent to receiving Ticketek special offers, Ticketek may use your personal information to provide special offers from third parties with Ticketek benefits (e.g. Ticketek reward points). In these circumstances, Ticketek may provide your data to a third party for the purpose of better understanding your needs and interests. Where special offers are sent to you, they will be sent by Ticketek and may be co-branded with the third party. You may opt out from receiving Ticketek special offers at any time by logging onto the Ticketek website and up-dating your personal details.

**D**. Provision of online customer data to other Nine Entertainment Co. entities  
Ticketek is owned by Nine Entertainment Co. With your consent, Ticketek may pass on your personal information to other entities owned fully or partially by Nine Entertainment Co., to provide you with Nine Entertainment Co. special offers. Relevant Nine Entertainment Co. entities include, the Nine Network, ACP Magazines, ninemsn and other entities that may in future become part of the Nine Entertainment Co. group of companies. The special offers provided by these entities may relate to Nine Entertainment Co. services or products or third party services or products that provide Nine Entertainment Co. entity benefits (e.g. Nine Entertainment Co. entity reward points). You may change your consent at any time either by logging onto the Ticketek website or the website of the other relevant Nine Entertainment Co. entities (for the special offers related to those Nine Entertainment Co. entities). Note that where you have opted-in to receive Nine Entertainment Co. special offers through a Nine Entertainment Co. entity other than Ticketek, then you must opt-out through that other entity. Further, opting-out of a Nine Entertainment Co. special offers consent may take up to 5 business days to be communicated to and implemented by all relevant Nine Entertainment Co. entities and will not override any other opt-ins you have selected with any specific Nine Entertainment Co. entity.

**E**. Third Party Advertisements Online  
To try and bring you offers that are of interest to you, Ticketek has relationships with other companies that we allow to place advertisements on our web pages. If you visit our website or mobile site, advertisement server companies may collect information such as your domain type, your IP address and clickstream information. For further information about this, we suggest you refer to the privacy policies of Omniture ([www.omniture.com](http://www.omniture.com/en)), Double Click ([www.doubleclick.net](http://www.doubleclick.net/)) and Nielsen/NetRatings ([www.netratings.com](http://www.netratings.com/)).

**F**. Secure Online Transactions  
If you make a purchase through our website or mobile site, we process your credit card details securely over the Internet using a Westpac-accredited Internet payment security system. With the combination of Ticketek.com's DigiCert SSL encryption at our website and a secure browser at your end, we take all measures to ensure that your credit card and anonymity are protected when you purchase online.

**G**. Links to other websites  
Sometimes our website or mobile site contains links to third party websites, for your convenience and information. When you access a non-Ticketek website, please understand that Ticketek is not responsible for the privacy practices of that site. We suggest that you review the privacy policies of each site you visit.
