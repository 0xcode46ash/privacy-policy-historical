# Tiscali - Privacy Policy

**TISCALI PRIVACY POLICY**

We are committed to protecting your right to privacy. Any information you provide to us will be held on computers that are based in the UK. We collect information about our users in order to help continually improve the Tiscali Internet Access and Portal Services. We also use the information you provide us to enter into commercial arrangements, including the sale of advertising space, which allow the Tiscali Portal Service to remain free for all our users. We will always adhere to the Data Protection Act 1998 (UK) in relation to our use of your information and any other applicable data protection laws. This Privacy Policy relates only to our use of the information you provide us and your use of the Tiscali Portal and does not extend to your use of the Internet other than the Tiscali Portal. 

**What data do we collect from you?**

We collect the personal data you provide when you register for Internet Access Services with us. We also collect any other personal data that you provide when using the Tiscali Portal, for example, to enter competitions. We also use cookie technology to monitor which areas of the Tiscali Portal you prefer. The information obtained from the cookies is not stored alongside your personal data and will only be used on an anonymous, aggregated basis. We may also hold information relating to any transactions that you enter into with us or any of our third party retail partners. We also use special software to check that when you use the Tiscali Internet Service, you are using the most up to date telephone number. This software logs your user name and the number you use to dial in whenever you use the Service. The software will automatically alter the telephone number used if it is not the most up to date number. The software will continue to log, with Tiscali, your user name and the number you use to connect to the Internet (but will not alter any dial-up number) even after you have terminated your agreement and are no longer a Tiscali member. If you do not wish the software to perform this function after leaving Tiscali then you must uninstall the dialler software by following the uninstall instructions. To get to the uninstall instructions [click here](https://web.archive.org/members/myaccount/internet/tk_uninstall.html). 

**What we do with the data we collect from you?**

We may use the personal information we collect from you to build up a profile of your interests and preferences. This information may be disclosed to other Tiscali group companies and carefully selected third parties and/or used to make you aware of products or services that you may find of interest. If you do not wish to have your details passed on to carefully selected third parties or if you do not wish to receive unsolicited mailings from us please inform us by hand, post or fax in accordance with Clause 11.5 of the Terms and Conditions or via the Contact Details provided on the Tiscali Portal from time to time. 

**Third Party Advertising**

The advertisements appearing on the Tiscali Portal are delivered to you, on our behalf, by the web advertising agency DoubleClick. Information about your visit to the Tiscali Portal, such as the number of times you have viewed a particular advertisement (but not information about you, such as your name, address or any other personal information) is used by Doubleclick to decide which advertisements to serve to you. For more information about the use to Doubleclick put you data, please [click here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy). 

In the course of serving advertisements to you, DoubleClick may also use cookie technology but will not use such cookies to collect any personally identifiable information about you. For more information about DoubleClick cookies and how to "opt-out", please [click here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/opt-out.asp). 

**Private Communications**

It is our policy to respect the privacy of private communications. We will not intentionally inspect the contents of private communications sent or received using the Tiscali Portal except as required or permitted to do so by law. 

**Children and Tiscali**

We do not specifically collect information about children and believe that children should always get the consent of their parents before giving out any personal information. Where children are specifically encouraged to participate within the Tiscali Portal, they will always be advised that they should seek parental permission before they continue with the activity. We recommend that parents actively participate and where possible monitor their children's use of the Tiscali Internet Access Service and Portal. 

**Keeping your details private**

The use of Newsgroups or Forums/Chat, either within the Tiscali Portal or on the Internet, is at your own risk. This may result in you receiving unsolicited messages from other parties who have picked up your details from such services. Further, do not forget that if you enter your details in the Tiscali Users Directory they will be generally available to all Tiscali users. 

**Disclosure of data in accordance with law**

We may need to disclose your data to appropriate persons where required or permitted by law (for example, to law enforcement authorities in relation to the investigation of a suspected criminal offence). 

**Changing contact details**

You can update or amend your contact details at any time from within the Tiscali Portal. If you have any questions about the use of your personal data or if you wish to know how you can inspect or correct other personal data we may hold please contact us by hand, e-mail (by completing a form within the 'Contact Us' area of the portal), post or fax in accordance with Clause 11.4 of the Terms and Conditions or via the Contact Details provided on the Tiscali Portal. Or by calling 0906 300 6633 (calls charged at 50p per minute). 

**Changes to the Policy**

We may need to amend the Privacy Policy from time to time. Any such amendment will take effect as soon as it is posted on the Tiscali Portal. You are therefore encouraged to familiarise yourself with the Privacy Policy on a regular basis. The Privacy Policy will always be easily accessible online throughout Tiscali Portal.
