**How do we use your email address?**   
We use your email to communicate all kinds of Customer Service information. We use your email to:

Additionally, we will notify you of new products and upcoming sales and events, such as web-only specials, the Title 9k run, speakers, book signings and events that are of interest to women involved with sports. What we DON'T use it for is anything else. We don't sell or rent your email address to anyone. No partners, no manufacturers, no other lists. No fooling. If you only want to get emails from us about your order and not about sales and special events, [unsubscribe](https://em.titlenine.com/servlet/campaignrespondent?_ID_=tnine.8&SUBMIT=1) from our email updates.
