# Your Privacy - Title Nine

Title Nine values our customers and respects your privacy. We collect information about you on our website in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to communicate with you about orders, services and products. This policy describes how we collect and use your personal information.

**What Personal Information does Title Nine collect?**  
When you place an order with us we collect your name, address, email address, telephone number and credit card information. If you ask to be placed on our email list, we will collect your name and email address.

**How do we use your email address?**  
We use your email to communicate all kinds of Customer Service information. We use your email to: 

  * Send you immediate confirmation of your order
  * Send you confirmation when your order ships
  * Send you information when your backorder ships
  * Send you confirmation that we received your return



Additionally, we will notify you of new products and upcoming sales and events, such as web-only specials, the Title 9k run, speakers, book signings and events that are of interest to women involved with sports. We may also email you about other Title Nine brands, such as Bounce. What we DON'T use it for is anything else. We don't sell or rent your email address to anyone. No partners, no manufacturers, no other lists. No fooling. If you only want to get emails from us about your order and not about sales and special events, [unsubscribe](https://em.titlenine.com/pub/sf/ResponseForm?_ri_=X0Gzc2X%3DS%3ApglLjHJlT%3ASWTU%3ASDBTYW%3ABSDBTDD%3ASSSDCY%3AqDTTUUBTRUACYWBBYCRC%3AG%3AvVXMtX%3DS%3ApglLjHJlT%3ASWTU%3ASDBTYW%3ABSDBTDD%3ASSSDCA%3AqDTTUUBTRUACYWBBYCRC%3Azg%3Av&_ei_) from our email updates. 

**With whom is this information shared?**   
Your information is sometimes shared with vendors Title Nine has partnered with to process and ship your order. Sometimes we make your name and postal address available to other direct marketing companies who may have offers of interest to you. If do not wish to receive such mailings, please call our gals in Customer Service at 800-342-4448 or send us an email at [thefolks@titlenine.com](mailto:thefolks@titlenine.com).
