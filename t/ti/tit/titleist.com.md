**ACUSHNET COMPANY PRIVACY POLICY**

**  
**Welcome to[www.titleist.com](http://www.titleist.com/). The Acushnet Company wants you to know what information we collect from you when you visit this site, what we do with that information, and how you can change the information we have.  Your use of this Internet site (this "Site") indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy, which may be revised at any time by Acushnet Company.

  
**What Information Is Collected  
** When you visit [www.titleist.com](http://www.titleist.com/), we recognize only your domain name and not your e-mail address. We will see your e-mail address only if you fill out a form or send us an e-mail message. We may also collect information about you if you register on a page, fill out a survey, place an order, upload content, participate in our contests or if you otherwise voluntarily tell us about yourself or your activities.

  
**How Information Is Used  
** When you provide information about yourself, we use it to improve our products and services and the content of this Site. We may also use it to send you information about our products and services. If you do not want to receive e-mail from us about our products and services, please see the Choice/Opt-out section of our Privacy Policy. User content you submit will be publicly available, thus if you include in your submission personally identifiable information, that information will become available to the general public on the Site.  We may create aggregate information records from personal information by excluding information that makes the information personally identifiable to you.  We reserve the right to use and disclose aggregate information at our discretion.

**Cookies  
** Titleist.com uses cookies to track online activity of Web users. A cookie is a piece of data on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our Site. The cookie was placed by us, or by DoubleClick. With both cookies and transparent GIFs, the information that we collect is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to <http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy>.

**Transparent GIFs  
** Titleist.com uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage our online advertising and to help us manage our content by informing us what content is effective. Transparent GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our Site. Transparent GIFs are not tied to a user's personally identifiable information.

  
**Sharing Information  
** We may need to disclose personal information if required by law when we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on us, or when necessary to protect the rights, safety or property of users of our Website, the Public or Acushnet Company.  If we merge with, or are acquired by another company, or sell all or substantially all of our relevant assets, or file for bankruptcy, we may disclose personal information to the acquirer.  We do not otherwise share personal information with third parties, unless you specifically request that we share your personal information with a particular third party.

  
**Choice/Opt-out  
** Our users are given the opportunity to opt-out of having their email address used for commercial emails from Acushnet Company.  Users who no longer wish to receive our promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by modifying your preferences in your titleist.com user profile, or you may contact us via email at [webmaster@acushnetgolf.com](mailto:webmaster@acushnetgolf.com) or at 1-800-225-8500.

[  
](http://www.titleist.com/customerservice/default.asp) **Use of This Website by Children  
** This Site is not designed for, nor do we believe it is appealing to, children under the age of 13.  We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.

  
**Links  
** This Site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Site.

  
**Security  
** We use reasonable efforts to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Site, we use reasonable efforts to protect our users' information both online and off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with encryption software. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of most Web browsers becomes locked.

When we use software to protect your information online, we also use reasonable efforts to protect your information off-line. Access to our users' information is restricted to our employees of our company and its affiliates and agencies who need the information to perform a specific job (such as billing or shipping).

  Although we have taken steps to ensure that your personal information is not collected, used, or disclosed except as set forth by this Privacy Policy, technical mistakes are possible.  We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of electronically stored sensitive personal data via email or by conspicuous posting on the Website as soon as possible to the extent consistent with (a) the legitimate needs of law enforcement and (b) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

  
**Correcting, Updating or Deleting Personal Information  
** If a user's personally identifiable information changes, or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete a user's personally identifiable information.  This can be done by logging into your profile at titleist.com registration on the home page or by our customer support at 1-800-225-8500.  If you request that we delete your personally identifiable information or deactivate your account we may retain aggregate information developed from your personal information.

[  
](http://www.titleist.com/customerservice/default.asp) **Notification of Changes  
** We reserve the right to change or update this policy at any time by posting a notice to that effect on this Site and other places where we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. However, if we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the Site, or deleted their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Site notifying users of the change. In some cases, where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.  Your continued use of this Site constitutes your consent to these changes.

Contact Information  
** If users have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us by sending a question via our FAQ, or by calling 1-800-225-8500.
