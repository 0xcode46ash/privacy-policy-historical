# Respawn Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy ******

Respawn Entertainment, LLC, a California Limited Liability Company (“ **Respawn** ,” “ **we** ,” “ **us** ,” “ **our** ”) respects your privacy rights, and the protection of those rights is important to us. To explain how we collect, store and use personal and non-personal information collected or received through our mobile application or website located at _(<http://www.respawn.com/>)_ (“ **Website** ”) and games produced by us (“ **Games** ”), we have adopted this Privacy Policy.

Be sure to return to this page periodically to ensure familiarity with the most current version of this Agreement. We reserve the right at any time, with or without cause, to change the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. Any changes we make will be effective immediately upon our making such changes available on the Website or otherwise providing notice thereof, including but not limited to providing notice when you connect to a Game. You agree that your continued use of the Website or Games after such changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes.

**What Information and Activities This Privacy Policy Covers**

Personal information includes information about you that can be used to identify you as an individual, such as your name, address, e-mail address or phone number. Non-personal information includes information about your use of the Website or the Games, as well as the computers, devices, and networks that you use to connect to the Games or the Website. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the personal information you submit to us. Inaccurate information may affect your ability to use the Website, the information you receive when using the Website, and our ability to contact you. For example, your email address should be kept current because that is one of the primary manners in which we communicate with you.

This Privacy Policy applies to any personal and non-personal information collected or received by us through our Website or Games. If you submit information to Respawn in other ways, or we receive it in other ways, Respawn may use that information for additional reasons not identified in this Privacy Policy. 

This Privacy Policy only applies only to Respawn. It does not apply to the practices of companies that Respawn does not own or control, or to people that Respawn does not employ or manage. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, connecting to Respawn’s Games requires the use of an Origin account provided by Electronic Arts, Xbox LIVE account provided by Microsoft, and/or other accounts provided by third parties. Your use of those accounts and the Games through those accounts will be governed by separate privacy policies that apply between you and those third parties, and you should refer to those privacy policies to determine how your personal and non-personal information may be collected and used by those companies.

**Notice Concerning Children**

**PLEASE NOTE:** This Website and any information, products, or services provided therein are limited to audiences thirteen (13) years of age or older. The Website does not direct any content specifically at children. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a user is under age thirteen (13), we will promptly delete any personal information in that user’s account.

**What You Consent to by Using Our Website and Games**

Please understand that by submitting any personal information to us, you consent and agree that we may collect, use and disclose such personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, and as permitted or required by law. If you do not agree with these terms, then please do not provide any personal information to us. If you refuse or withdraw your consent, or if you choose not to provide us with any required personal information, we may not be able to provide you with the products or services that can be offered on our Website.

**Information Collection.**

1\. **_Personal Information._ ** Respawn collects personal information that you provide to us when using the Website, such as when you register with the Website, participate in our public forums, send us email messages, participate in contests/sweepstakes and make purchases on our Website. Among other things, we may collect and use the personal information that you provide to respond to your questions, provide you the specific services you select, send you the products that you order, send you updates about Respawn, send you email messages about Website maintenance and updates and inform you of significant changes to this Privacy Policy. Specifically, we collect personal information in the following ways:

a. **Updates.** Respawn may offer you the ability to receive email updates either via email or another subscription service such as Facebook or Twitter. In order to subscribe to these services, you may be required to provide us with personal information such as your name, email address and zip code.

b. **Registration/Creating a Profile.** Respawn offers you the ability to register with the Website and create an online Profile. In order to register, you are required to provide us with personal information such as your full name, birthdate and email address. You may also submit additional information that may enhance your experience, including your Origin account, Xbox LIVE account, Steam ID, PlayStation Network ID, website URL, location, and/or a short bio.

c. **Forums.** Respawn offers the ability to comment on Profiles and may offer other public forums from time to time (the “Forums”) where you can share comments and thoughts. In order to participate in the Forums, you may be required to register with us and/or provide us with personal information such as your name and email address. Personal information shall not include any information posted or sent by or to you via any public Forum. 

d. **Participation in Contests, Sweepstakes, and Other Promotions.** From time to time, Respawn may offer you the opportunity to participate in a contest, sweepstakes, or other promotions on or through the Website. If you desire to participate in any such contest, sweepstakes, or other promotion, you will be asked to provide us with certain information necessary to conduct such contest, sweepstakes, or other promotion. This information may include, among other things, your name, age, mailing address, email address, and phone number. 

e. **Communications with Respawn.** We may receive personal information when you send us an email message or otherwise contact us.

f. **Game Play Information.** As noted above, Game play requires use of an Origin account provided by Electronic Arts, Xbox LIVE account provided by Microsoft, and/or other accounts provided by third parties. Respawn does not collect or gather any personal information in connection with your use of the Game. Your use of the Game via an Origin account provided by Electronic Arts, Xbox LIVE account provided by Microsoft, and/or other accounts provided by third parties will be governed by separate privacy policies that apply between you and those third parties, and you should refer to those third-party privacy policies to determine how your personal and non-personal information may be collected and used by those companies. Respawn does, however, collect user statistics, Game play statistics and performance information related to Game play from such third parties. We may also obtain this information directly from users. This information is used internally and by our Game developers to enhance the Game experience and may otherwise be used in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

2\. **_Non-Personal Information._** Your use of the Website automatically provides us with certain personal and non-personal information provided by your computer, Xbox One, or other gaming device, and by your browser and other software running on those systems. This information may include unique identifiers associated with your Origin account, Xbox LIVE account, or other third-party service to which you are logged in when you connect to the Games or Website. It also includes your IP address, Respawn ‘cookie’ information, hardware and software attributes, the Games accessed and Website pages requested, and data contained in page requests from referring devices, services, or web pages. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site and stored on your computer or other device’s hard drive. 

**Information Use**

The personal and non-personal information we collect may be used in the following ways:  
• to provide you with the services that you request (“ **Services** ”);  
• to control access to and facilitate the operation of our Website and Services,

•We may use or transfer personal or non-personal information about you if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of you or other users of the Website, Services or Games.

• We transfer personal and non-personal information about you if Respawn is acquired by or merged with another company. 

**Protection Of Information Collected**

We maintain safeguards for the purpose of ensuring the confidentiality and security of the personal information you submit to us. While we believe that these safeguards are adequate and appropriate to protect your confidential information, you should be aware that there is always a possibility of intrusion into secured computer systems, and you should take that into account in deciding whether to submit any personal information to us. 

**Public Information**

In addition to the non-personal information we collect, you may choose to disclose personal or other information about yourself by submitting information to be displayed as part of your public profile, by posting information to our public forums, or in the course of any public method of communication permitted by our Website, Services, or Games. Information that you disclose in any of these manners is public information, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality in such information.

We are not responsible for any personal information (or any images, videos, or other media) you choose to submit in these manners. Additionally, any information you submit in these manners is subject to our Terms of Service.

**External Links**

For your convenience we may provide links to websites operated by companies other than us (“ **Third Party Sites** ”) that we believe may be of interest to you. Unless expressly set forth herein, we do not disclose your personal information to these Third Party Sites without obtaining your consent. We do not endorse and are not responsible for the privacy practices of these Third Party Sites. If you choose to link to one of these Third Party Sites, you should review the privacy policy posted on the other website to understand how that Third Party Site collects and uses your personal information. Further, it is up to you to take precautions to ensure that whatever links you select are free of such items as viruses, worms, Trojan horses, date or time bombs and other items of a destructive nature
