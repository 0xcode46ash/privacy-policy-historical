# Tilly's Privacy Policy - Clothing Shoes Accessories

**Privacy Policy**

Revised: 12/30/13

At Tilly's, our relationship with our customers is very important to us. That is why we work hard to protect your privacy and security. We prepared this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, protect, and disclose information and data when you use the Tilly's web site and mobile applications (collectively, the "Web Site"). We collect customer specific information in an effort to communicate details about our products, services, contests, and promotions and for other reasons described below. Please know that Tilly's will never disclose your personal information to any third party, unless it is necessary to provide you with products or services from Tilly's or as otherwise described in our Privacy Policy.

**Information We Collect**

When you place an order on our Web Site, make a purchase in one of our stores, create an account, sign up for our loyalty program, sign up to receive e-mails or catalogues from us, enter a contest or sweepstakes, or otherwise interact with us, we may ask for your name, payment information, billing address, shipping address, phone number, mobile phone number, or e-mail address. The decision to provide this information is optional, however, if you choose not to provide the requested information, you may not be able to use some or all of the features of the Web Site. Some of this information may be stored in the form of a "cookie" on your computer. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer. Your Web browser may give you the option to refuse cookies. You may not be able to use some or all of the features of the Web Site if you disable or delete cookies. We also may receive personal information through the use of social media web sites and services or from other sources.

We automatically collect information regarding the actions you take on the Site ("Usage Data"). For example, each time you use the Web Site we may automatically collect the type of Web browser you use, your operating system, your Internet Service Provider, your IP address, the pages you view, and the time and duration of your visits to the Web Site. This anonymous usage information may be associated with your username or other personal information. We use this information to help us understand how people use the Web Site, and to enhance the services we offer. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer the Web Site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information. Some of this information may also be stored using cookies.

**How We Use Information and When We May Share and Disclose Information Generally**

We use your personal information and Usage Data to provide the Web Site, to fulfill your orders, and to otherwise provide you with services that you request. We may also use your personal information to e-mail, text message, mail, or otherwise send you information about new products and special features at Tilly's. We may also offer you special promotions. If you prefer not to receive these e-mails, please indicate that when completing your order. For more information about managing your information choices, see "Your Information Choices" below.

From time to time, we may establish marketing relationships with other people or entities whom we believe trustworthy and whom we have asked to confirm that their privacy practices are consistent with ours. We may disclose to third parties, certain usage data regarding the Web Site. Your Usage Data may be aggregated with the Usage Data of others and not identify you individually or it may include associated data that does identify you. We will not disclose personal information to third parties, including for their direct marketing purposes, without your consent, except as explained in this Privacy Policy.

**Security and Credit Card Safety**

Protecting the safety of your credit card information is important to us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your credit card information as it is transmitted to us. SSL is a highly sophisticated method of scrambling data as it travels from your computer to our Web Site's servers.

To make sure you are accessing our secure server before you submit personal financial information, look at the lower left-hand corner of your Web browser. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), then SSL is active. To double-check for security, look at the URL or "Address" line of your Web browser. If you have accessed a secure server, the first characters of the address in that line should change from "http" to "https".

That said, no data transmission over the Internet or other network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect information transmitted on or through the Web Site, we cannot and do not guarantee the security of any information you transmit on or through the Web Site, and you do so at your own risk.

**Your Information Choices**

We will occasionally send members of our distribution list information and valuable offers by mail or e-mail, or text message if you have opted into receiving text messages. You may unsubscribe from our marketing lists at any time. To unsubscribe from receiving marketing e-mails, please click on the appropriate link at the bottom of any marketing e-mail from Tilly's or by signing into your account on the Web Site and changing your e-mail preferences. If you have opted in to receive text messages from us through contest entries or other means, you can unsubscribe from receiving text messages at any time by: (1) replying to the text message with the word "STOP"; (2) sending the text message "STOP" to 38714; or (3) contacting us. You can also contact us directly to unsubscribe from mail, e-mail, or text communications by e-mailing us at [customerservice@tillys.com.](mailto:customerservice@tillys.com)

**Service Providers**

From time to time, we may contract with other businesses whom we believe trustworthy and who have confirmed that their privacy practices are consistent with ours to perform services for or on behalf of Tilly's ("Service Providers"). For example, we may contract with Service Providers to provide certain services, such as hosting and maintenance, data storage and management, and marketing and promotions. Some of our Service Providers may use their own cookies or other tracking technology in connection with the services they perform on our behalf. We only provide our Service Providers with the information necessary for them to perform these services on our behalf. Each Service Provider must agree to use reasonable security procedures and practices, appropriate to the nature of the information involved, in order to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Service Providers are prohibited from using personal information other than as specified by Tilly's.

**Advertising**

We may allow third-party companies to serve ads or collect certain anonymous information when you visit the Web Site. These companies may use browsing information (e.g., click stream information, Web browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to the Web Site and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about products and services likely to be of interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or other technology to collect this information. Our systems do not recognize Do Not Track signals from browsers. However, many third party services that collect this type of information permit you to opt out through a separate system. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising from participating third parties providers, you can visit [http://www.networkadvertising.org/ ](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) .In addition, please see the Your Information Choices section to learn how to manage what marketing or other information you receive directly from us.

**Other Transfers**

We may share personal information and Usage Data with businesses controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Tilly's. If Tilly's is merged, acquired, or sold, or in the event of a transfer of some or all of our assets, we may disclose or transfer personal information and Usage Data in connection with such transaction. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if, in our discretion, the new entity plans to handle your information in a way that differs materially from this Privacy Policy.

**Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement**

Tilly's cooperates with government and law enforcement officials to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose personal information and any other information about you if we believe it is reasonably necessary to respond to legal requests (including court orders and subpoenas), to protect the safety, property, or rights of Tilly's, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law.

**Be Careful Sharing Information with Others**

Please remember that when you share information with third parties, that information may be passed along or made public by others. This means that anyone with access to such information can potentially use it for any purpose, including sending unsolicited communications. You are solely responsible for keeping your login credentials and any other account numbers or access codes secure. 

**Links to Other Web Sites**

Our Web Site may contain links to other web sites, or allow others to send you such links. A link to a third party's web site does not mean that we endorse it or that we are affiliated with it. We do not exercise control over third-party web sites. You access such third-party web sites or content at your own risk. You should always read the privacy policy of a third-party web site before providing any information to the web site.
