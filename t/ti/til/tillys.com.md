# Tilly's Privacy Policy - Clothing Shoes Accessories

At Tilly's, our relationship with our customers is very important to us. That is why we make every attempt to ensure your privacy and security. We collect customer specific information in an effort to communicate details about our products, services, contests, and promotions. You should be assured that Tillys.com will never disclose your identity or personal information to any third party.

 **For Concerned Parents**

If you have concerns about Tillys.com or our services and wish to find out if your child is a member of our mailing list or wish to cancel your child's membership, please contact us immediately. Tillys.com is intended for use by individuals who are at least 13 years old. Our site will not knowingly accept personal information from anyone under 13. If you believe that your child under 13 has been contacted by us or has gained access to our site without your permission, please contact Tilly's at our contact information below. 

**Special Offers**

We will occasionally send members of our mailing list information and valuable offers by e-mail. Subscription to our list is completely voluntary, and you may choose to unsubscribe at any time. To unsubscribe, please click on the appropriate link at the bottom of the received e-mail. To subscribe, simply fill out our mailing list form. 

**Contests**

All contests and drawings conducted on any Tilly's site or location are conducted in accordance with both federal and state laws. Information collected during any contest is merely to assist us in identifying and contacting winners. Contest entrants will automatically be included in our mailing list and can unsubscribe at any time. 

**Information We Gather**

When a customer places an order over our web site, we will ask for your payment method preference, credit card account number and expiration date (if applicable), name as it appears on your credit card, "bill to" address, daytime phone number, and e-mail address. You will have the option of saving this information for future purchases. Some of this information may be stored in the form of a "cookie" in your computer. Cookies are text files that are stored on your computer. Your browser should give you the option to refuse cookies. The Tillys.com site requires that you have cookies enabled on your browser security settings.

We may use your IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information. 

We may also use your contact information to e-mail you newsletters that inform you of new products and special features at Tillys.com. We may also offer you special promotions from our site or our sponsors. If you prefer not to receive such communications, you may contact us at our contact information below.

 **Credit Card Safety**

Protecting the safety of your credit card information is important to us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your credit card information as it is transmitted to us.Â  SSL is the gold standard in Internet encryption technology, which is a fancy way of saying that it's a highly sophisticated method of scrambling data as it travels from your computer to our website's servers.

 **How do I know my credit card information is secure?**

To make sure you are accessing our secure server before you submit personal financial information, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), then SSL is active. To double-check for security, look at the URL or Location line of your browser. If you have accessed a secure server, the first characters of the address in that line should change from "http" to "https."
