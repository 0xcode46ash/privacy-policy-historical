# TIAA-CREF - The Company

  
Safeguarding your personal information is something that we take very seriously at TIAA-CREF. We want to assure you that we will not sell or barter your personal information or our mailing lists to any person or organization. You have entrusted us with an important role in your financial future and we are committed to keeping your personal information secure and to the principles stated in this notice whether you are a current, prospective or former customer.

Please read this notice carefully. It will provide you with information about the TIAA-CREF companies' policy and procedures with respect to your personal information in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act (GLB). The "TIAA-CREF companies" are as follows:

1 _While TIAA, TIAA-CREF Tuition Financing, Inc. and TPIS may receive customer information from other TIAA-CREF companies to market the state tuition savings programs, customer information collected by these companies in managing such programs is not disclosed by them, other than in accordance with the applicable program agreements._

_2 Unless, you opt out, the other TIAA-CREF companies may disclose customer information to TIAA-CREF Trust Company, FSB. The policy of TIAA-CREF Trust Company, FSB regarding nonpublic personal financial information is stated in a separate notice issued by the Trust Company to its customers._

**Information We May Collect**

We may collect nonpublic personal financial information about you from various sources. For example, a TIAA-CREF company may collect:

  * information you provide on applications and forms or during consultations, or that may be necessary to complete your requested transaction;
  * information pertaining to your relationship with other TIAA-CREF companies, such as your ownership of their products;
  * information from consumer reporting agencies, such as marital status, income, size of household, credit score or credit history, open lines of credit, and employment history; and 
  * health information for those applying for or owning a long-term care or life insurance policy or making a claim under a group long-term disability plan. At no time do we disclose your health information to any other TIAA-CREF company or other person unless authorized by you or required by law.



**How Your Information Is Used**

Your personal information is used primarily to provide you with products and services you request. It also may be used to determine your possible interest in products and services the TIAA-CREF companies offer. If you are a participant in an employer-sponsored pension plan which is funded with a TIAA-CREF annuity contract, your plan account information also is available to your employer for plan administrative purposes.

We limit access to your personal information to those TIAA-CREF employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you or for conducting the business of the TIAA-CREF companies. Further, your personal information is protected by physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in accordance with Federal and state standards, including strict personnel policies, procedures for access and use of electronic data, and automated telephone system authentication procedures.

**Disclosure of Your Information**

We do not disclose your personal information to anyone outside of the TIAA-CREF companies unless we have received proper authorization from you or we are permitted or required by law to do so. For example, we use independent service providers to mail out account statements and materials that you request. In order to protect your privacy, our service providers are subject to strict confidentiality, limited use, and nondisclosure agreements.

Providing the TIAA-CREF companies with access to your information can offer you distinct advantages and better service because it would enable us to provide you with more comprehensive financial guidance. In fact, we have established different TIAA-CREF companies to offer you various types of financial products and services. Using your information helps us tailor product offerings, eliminating those that may not interest you, and helps us keep expenses low by minimizing duplication. However, if you do not want other TIAA-CREF companies to use your personal financial information this way, you may simply let us know by opting out.

Therefore, **unless you tell us otherwise** , any of the TIAA-CREF companies may access your nonpublic personal financial information from records the other TIAA-CREF companies maintain, including:

  * information we obtain from your application, or otherwise obtain to complete your requested transaction, such as your age, marital status, beneficiaries, assets, income, Social Security number, and employer; and
  * information we obtain from a consumer report, such as credit data, age, income, and marital status.



If you opt out, the information about you described above will not be used by any other TIAA-CREF company to notify you about new products, services, or enhancements. We may, however, disclose your personal financial information to other TIAA-CREF companies as permitted by law. At no time do we disclose your health information to any other TIAA-CREF company or other person unless authorized by you or required by law.

**Your Right to Opt Out**

If you opt out, your information will not be available to other TIAA-CREF companies. To opt out, please call the Telephone Counseling Center at 800 842-2776 or print out and complete the [Privacy Policy form](https://web.archive.org/web/20011224161958id_/http%3A//www.tiaa.org/a_company/images/privacy_policy.pdf) and mail it to:

> TIAA-CREF-Participant Privacy  
>  P.O. Box 4603   
>  New York, NY 10163-4603

If you own a life insurance contract or a TIAA-CREF Mutual Funds account with a co-owner, you and the co-owner may opt out separately or either of you may opt out for both of you. We will only limit disclosure of your information and not the co-owner's information, unless you indicate that you also are opting out for the co-owner or the co-owner sends us a separate form.

You may receive more than one privacy notice from TIAA-CREF depending on the TIAA-CREF products you own. To opt out, you need to respond only once. Your request will be treated as an opt-out in accordance with this notice for each of the TIAA-CREF companies. Your opt-out will become effective as soon as practicable and will remain in effect unless you notify us to change it.

**TIAA-CREF's Commitment to Privacy on our Web Sites**

Regardless of which TIAA-CREF products you may own, we also are committed to keeping your personal information secure on our Internet websites. When you visit our Web Center, you can go to pages that are open to the general public or log onto secure pages where access is permitted only after you have supplied your use name and self-selected password. In making certain services available to customers on the Internet, we operate an Internet firewall designed to protect these services. Only explicitly authorized procedures are made available, limiting the exposure to attempts to penetrate the network perimeter and gain access to corporate network facilities. The services permitted, electronic mail and access to TIAA-CREF Web facilities, are secured in accordance with current industry best practices. Interaction with non-public Web sites where customer data is accessed and transactions are performed is encrypted. Access to data is controlled by the application itself through authentication procedures. These procedures serve to verify your identity, so that only you can access your account and initiate transactions through our Web Center.

To facilitate information retrieval and expedite your transactions, we place a small text file -- referred to as a "cookie" -- on your computer system when you access one of our secure functions. Our TIAA-CREF cookie is erased from your system whenever your connection to the secure function is terminated because you log off or the function is idle for twenty consecutive minutes. Our cookie does not collect or retain information. Only our highly secure corporate systems retain records of your transactions.

**Changes in our Privacy Policy**

TIAA-CREF periodically reviews its policies and reserves the right to amend them. If we amend our privacy policy, we will continue our commitment to keeping your personal information secure and will notify you of any changes before they become effective.
