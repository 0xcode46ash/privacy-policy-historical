**Safeguarding your personal information is something that we take very seriously at TIAA-CREF. We assure you that we will not sell or barter your personal information or our mailing lists to any person or organization.** You have entrusted us with an important role in your financial future and we are committed to keeping your personal information secure. We are also committed to the principles stated in this notice whether you are a current, prospective or former customer.

Please read this notice carefully. It will provide you with information about the TIAA-CREF companies' policy and procedures with respect to your personal information in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act (GLB). The "TIAA-CREF companies" are described in this notice. A [separate notice](https://web.archive.org/web/20031202171719id_/http%3A//tiaa-cref.org/a_company/privacy_notice.html) describing additional privacy practices related to health information is provided to our Long Term Care Insurance customers, and should be read together with this notice by those customers. 

**Information We May Collect  
**We may collect nonpublic personal information about you from various sources. For example, a TIAA-CREF company may collect: 

  * information you provide on applications and forms or during consultations, or that may be necessary to complete your requested transaction;
  

  * information pertaining to your relationship with other TIAA-CREF companies, such as your ownership of their products;
  

  * information from consumer reporting agencies, such as marital status, income, size of household, credit score or credit history, open lines of credit, and employment history; and
  

  * health information for those applying for or owning a long-term care or life insurance policy. At no time do we disclose your health information to any other TIAA-CREF company or other person unless authorized by you or required by law.
  



**How Your Information Is Used  
**Your personal information is used primarily to provide you with products and services you request. It also may be used to determine your possible interest in products and services the TIAA-CREF companies offer. If you are a participant in an employer-sponsored pension plan which is funded with a TIAA-CREF annuity contract, your plan account information also is available to your employer for plan administrative purposes. 

We limit access to your personal information to those TIAA-CREF employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you or for conducting the business of the TIAA-CREF companies. Further, your personal information is protected by physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in accordance with federal and state standards, including strict personnel policies, procedures for access and use of electronic data, and automated telephone system authentication procedures. 

**Disclosure Of Your Information  
**We do not disclose your personal information to anyone outside of the TIAA-CREF companies unless we have received proper authorization from you or we are permitted or required by law to do so. For example, we may use independent service providers to mail account statements, product information, or materials that you request. In order to protect your privacy, our service providers are subject to strict confidentiality, limited use, and nondisclosure agreements with respect to the personal information that is provided to them for these purposes. 

Providing the TIAA-CREF companies with access to your information can offer you distinct advantages and better service because it would enable us to provide you with more comprehensive financial guidance. In fact, we have established different TIAA-CREF companies to offer you various types of financial products and services. Using your information helps us tailor product offerings, eliminating those that may not interest you, and helps us keep expenses low by minimizing duplication. However, if you do not want other TIAA-CREF companies to use your personal financial information this way, you may simply let us know by opting out. 

Therefore, **unless you tell us otherwise,** any of the TIAA-CREF companies may access your nonpublic personal financial information from records the other TIAA-CREF companies maintain, including: 

  * information we obtain from your application, or otherwise obtain to complete your requested transaction, such as your age, marital status, beneficiaries, assets, income, Social Security number, and employer; and 
  * information we obtain from a consumer report, such as credit data, age, income, and marital status. 

If you opt out, the information about you described above will not be used by any other TIAA-CREF company to notify you about new products, services, or enhancements. We may, however, disclose your personal financial information to other TIAA-CREF companies as permitted by law. 

**Your Right to Opt Out  
**If you opt out, your information will not be available to other TIAA-CREF companies. To opt out, please call the **ATS Service Center at 877 518-9161.**

If you own a life insurance policy or are a TIAA-CREF Mutual Funds shareholder with a co-owner, you and the co-owner may opt out separately or either of you may opt out for both of you. We will only limit disclosure of your information and not the co-owner's information, unless you indicate that you also are opting out for the co-owner or the co-owner calls us. 

You may receive more than one privacy notice from the TIAA-CREF companies depending on the products you own. To opt out, you need to call only once. Your opt out will apply to each of the TIAA-CREF companies. Your opt out becomes effective as soon as practicable and remains in effect until you revoke it in writing. Even if you have opted out, you will receive our Privacy Policy every year as required by law. However, if you previously opted out and have not revoked your opt out by writing to us, your opt out remains in effect and no further action is necessary.

**Changes In Our Privacy Policy  
**TIAA-CREF periodically reviews its policies and reserves the right to amend them. If we amend our privacy policy, we will continue our commitment to keeping your personal information secure and will notify you of any changes before they become effective.
