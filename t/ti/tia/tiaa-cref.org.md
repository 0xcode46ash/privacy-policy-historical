We protect your privacy in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACT Act), the Gramm-Leach Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act (GLB), and this Privacy Policy. TIAA or the "TIAA-CREF companies" are described in this notice.

Browsing to other sites:   
When you use a link to go from TIAA-CREF.org to another web, the TIAA-CREF.org Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other web site is subject to the rules and policies of that site. We encourage you to read the rules and policies of the sites you visit to further understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information.

How Your Information Is Used 

We use your personal information primarily to provide you with the products and services you request, and we use your personal information relating to transactions and experiences with the TIAA-CREF companies to conduct their business. As permitted by law, we may also share your personal information with select partners with whom we have joint marketing agreements in order to provide you with a variety of products and services. We require these companies to meet privacy standards described below. Unless you have told us otherwise pursuant to “Your Right To Opt-Out” below, we may also use your personal information to market or determine your possible interest in products and services that the other TIAA-CREF companies offer. If you are a participant in an employer-sponsored retirement or savings plan investing in a TIAA-CREF or third-party annuity contract or a TIAA-CREF or third-party mutual fund, we may share the information we collect with your employer and its agents, if any for plan administration purposes.

Disclosure of Your Information 

We share your personal information with other TIAA-CREF companies as permitted by law. We will not disclose your personal information to anyone outside of the TIAA-CREF companies unless: 1) we have received proper consent from you; 2) we are legally permitted to do so; or 3) we reasonably believe, in good faith, that we are legally required to do so. In order to protect the confidentiality of your personal information, including personal information that we have disclosed to a third party pursuant to this Privacy Policy, we take appropriate measures, including requiring each third party to execute an appropriate confidentiality agreement governing the use of such information and only allowing access to the information for a limited purpose. For example, we may provide the information to assist us with various aspects of conducting our business, to comply with laws or industry regulations, and/or to effectuate any contract on your behalf, including the following:

  * Unaffiliated service providers (e.g., fulfillment companies and securities clearinghouses, data processing services, printers and mailing facilities) engaged by us;
  * Unaffiliated service providers (e.g., third-party administrators) engaged by your employer;
  * Unaffiliated fund and/or insurance companies and their agents whose investment options are made available to you through your employer-sponsored retirement or savings plan, provided monies are allocated to them on your behalf;
  * Government agencies, other regulatory bodies and law enforcement officials (e.g., for tax purposes or for reporting suspicious transactions);
  * Other organizations, with your consent or as directed by you (e.g., if you use TIAA-CREF as a financial reference in applying for credit with another institution); and
  * Other organizations, as permitted or required by law (e.g., for fraud prevention).



We require that third parties with which we share your personal information protect such information by utilizing the privacy and security safeguards required by law.

Security of Your Information 

TIAA-CREF protects the personal information you provide against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, destruction, loss, or misuse. Your personal information is protected by physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in accordance with federal and state standards. These safeguards include appropriate procedures for access and use of electronic data, provisions for the secure transmission of sensitive personal information on our website, and telephone system authentication procedures. Additionally, we limit access to your personal information to those TIAA-CREF employees and agents who need your personal information in order to provide products or services to you.

Your Right to Opt Out 

Providing us with access to your information permits us to offer you distinct advantages and better service. It enables us to provide you with more comprehensive financial guidance. In fact, we have established different TIAA-CREF companies to offer you various types of financial products and services. Using your information helps us tailor product offerings to you and eliminate those that may not interest you. This helps us keep expenses low.

Federal law gives you the right to limit some but not all sharing of your nonpublic personal information. Unless you tell us otherwise, (i) any TIAA-CREF company may share information about your creditworthiness or (ii) may use your personal information from records maintained by one of the other TIAA-CREF companies for marketing purposes.

If you do not want other TIAA-CREF companies to share information about your creditworthiness or use your personal financial information for marketing purposes, you may simply let us know by opting out. If you opt out, we will not use your personal information to notify you of new products or services, nor will it be available to other TIAA-CREF companies for marketing purposes. It will, however, still be released as permitted or required by law. Please note that we cannot withdraw any previous disclosures made with your authorization.

To opt out, please call the ATS Service Center at 1 877 518-9161.

Customers of the TIAA-CREF Trust Company — If you are a client of TIAA-CREF Trust Company, FSB, and you own a joint account with a co-owner, you and the co-owner will both be treated as opting out if either of you should opt out. 

You may receive more than one privacy notice from the TIAA-CREF companies depending on the products you own.

If you own a life insurance contract or a TIAA-CREF Funds account with a co-owner, you and the co-owner may:

  * opt out separately; or
  * either of you may opt out for both of you.



If you opt out separately, we will limit disclosure of information only for the owner who has opted out. If you indicate that you are opting out for the co-owner as well, we will limit disclosure for both of you.

Your opt-out becomes effective as soon as practicable. It remains in effect until you revoke it in writing. No further action is needed. Even if you have opted out, you will receive our privacy notice each year as required by law.

Children's Privacy Online 

This website is not directed toward children. We do not knowingly collect or post information from children under the age of 18.
