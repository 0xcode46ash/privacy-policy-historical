**What this privacy policy covers**

This policy covers how TidalTV treats information that TidalTV collects and receives through our services, which include TidalTV’s video advertising network and ad targeting solutions and any other technology, products and/or services offered by TidalTV (collectively referred to as the “Services”), including your past use of the Services. For more information about our Services, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20090924143544id_/http%3A//www.tidaltv.com/index.html).

This policy does not apply to information about you collected by TidalTV's third party advertisers and publishers, or other third parties linked to or otherwise accessible via the Services. The information collected or received by any such providers and third parties is subject to their own privacy policies.

**Collection and Use of Information**

**Personal Information**

TidalTV does not require you to provide personal information in order to use many of the Services. To enhance your experience when using the Services, you may choose to register with TidalTV. Registering with TidalTV is optional. By registering, you gain access to enhanced features, including a variety of personalized programming and functionality, favorite program management, communication widgets and other offerings. If you register with TidalTV, you will be asked to provide TidalTV with personally identifiable information, which may include name, street address, email address and other personal information. When you register and sign-in to use the Services, you are not anonymous to us. TidalTV may combine information that we have about you with information we obtain from business partners and other companies.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

When you visit a web site in our video advertising network and view an advertisement that we’ve served to that site, TidalTV uses cookies and other technologies to record and store anonymous information about your interaction with the Services, most commonly known as “click-stream data”. Click-stream data can include information such as IP address, date/time of visit, browser type, web pages visited and information on your interaction with the Services, including whether you interacted with the advertisement (e.g., viewed the ad to completion or clicked on the ad), and what content you viewed. We may also use shared objects (sometimes referred to as “Flash cookies”) to store click-stream data and, in some instances, we may also use web beacons (also referred to as “pixels” or “gifs”) in connection with cookies and shared objects, in each case, to assist in providing you with more relevant, meaningful advertising experience. All browser activity reporting is done anonymously. For more detailed information on cookies, web beacons and shared objects, please see our [FAQs](https://web.archive.org/web/20090924143544id_/http%3A//www.tidaltv.com/faq.html)

In order to optimize the effectiveness of the Services for our clients, we supplement the click-stream data we collect with non-personally-identifiable behavioral and demographic data from third party data providers, publishers and other partners we work with. This anonymous data may include such things as zip code, age, gender and income range.

**Use and Disclosure**

TidalTV uses non-personal information it receives and collects to customize, target, and measure the effectiveness of the advertisements we deliver to you via the Service (including targeted advertising based on demographic characteristics, viewing preferences and behaviors), to prevent showing you the same ads repeatedly, and to predict the characteristics and preferences of our video network audience in order to assist advertisers in targeting their campaigns to the most relevant Internet audience.

TidalTV uses personal information you provide to us to communicate with and respond to your inquiries, to conduct research about use of the Services; to fulfill your requests for products and services; to help offer you other products, services or offerings that may be of interest to you; and to provide anonymous internal and external reporting. If you choose to provide us with personal information including your email address, we will not use your email address to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of important changes to the Services or for customer service purposes).

TidalTV will not rent, sell or share information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies, except to provide the Services, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

  


  * We will provide your information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with TidalTV under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help TidalTV fulfill a transaction you requested or communicate with you about offers from TidalTV and our marketing partners. However, unless you have granted permission, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
  

  * We work with third party vendors, partners, advertisers, publishers, demographic and behavioral data providers and other service and content providers. In order to optimize the Services and to better target advertisements, we may share information about you with them, including statistical and demographic data about our users and their use of the Services. We will not authorize these third party providers to share your information other than as necessary to provide the Services and to enhance user experience through targeting of ads.
  

  * If TidalTV, or part(s) of TidalTV, is acquired or merged with another company we will transfer information about you to the acquiring company.
  

  * Finally, TidalTV may share information on individuals it deems necessary to comply with a subpoena or court order, to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, or to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials.



**Third Party Service Providers**

TidalTV and its advertisers may use third party ad networks and technology providers to help present advertisements via the Services. These third party providers may also use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on your computer to collect click-stream data. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by such third-party providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not TidalTV's. Please contact them directly for information about their privacy practices. 

**Access To and Choices About Your Personal Information – Opting Out**

**Cookie Opt-Out**

TidalTV believes users should have information necessary to make informed decisions and the right to choose how their information is used. We provide you with the ability to opt-out of our use of your click-stream data in order to deliver tailored, more relevant advertising.

If you choose to opt-out of TidalTV cookies, your computer will request an “opt-out cookie” that will prevent us from matching your computer with your anonymous click-stream data and from using such data to deliver targeted advertising to your computer’s browser. The TidalTV opt-out cookie **_must_** remain on your computer in order for us to recognize you as an opt-out user. If you use multiple computers or multiple browsers you will need to opt-out of receiving cookies on each computer and for each browser. Also, if you change computers or delete cookies from your computer you will need to repeat this opt-out process.

**Personal Information**

TidalTV provides you with access to personal information you may have voluntarily provided to us. If, you provided us with personal information and would like to edit that information or have your personal information removed from our database completely; please contact us at [privacy@TidalTV.com](mailto:privacy@TidalTV.com) with your request. Once we receive your request, we will take prompt action to complete your request. Please note that in order for us to act on your request, we may need you to provide previously provided personal information in order to identify you for purposes of completing your request.

**Security**

Consistent with industry standards, TidalTV has established reasonable safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access to, disclosure, alteration or misuse of your information, but cannot guarantee that your data will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy (for example, as a result of unauthorized acts by third parties that violate applicable law or TidalTV’s policies). All data stored on TidalTV’s servers is treated as confidential. Our employees are aware of the confidential nature of such data and have limited access to it. The amount of time that we retain data we collect on our systems varies in length based on the type of data collected, but is only retained by us so long as necessary to fulfill our legitimate business needs.

**Children’s Privacy**

The Services are not developed or intended for children. If you believe your child has provided TidalTV with personally identifiable data and you would like to have the data removed, please contact us.
