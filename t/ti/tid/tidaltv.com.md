# Privacy Policy

Videology, Inc. is an online video advertising technology solutions provider, providing its clients with solutions to connect advertiser brands with consumers who are most interested in those brands. By leveraging the power of consumer data and ad decisioning, we increase accountability, and optimize the performance of video advertising campaigns by providing a more relevant, meaningful web experience for consumers who view the ads delivered through our advertising technology solutions.   


Through use of the Videology® services in the U.S. and in the United Kingdom (offered by Videology Ltd., Videology’s UK subsidiary), advertisers and publishers can take advantage of technology solutions to deliver, manage, target and measure the effectiveness of their online video advertising campaigns and inventory.   


Videology is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI). Our practices conform with the NAI’s Self-Regulatory Code.

Videology conforms to [Interactive Advertising Bureau's (IAB) Cross-Industry Privacy Guidelines for Interactive Advertising](http://www.iab.net/media/file/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf).

**What this privacy policy covers**

This policy covers how Videology treats information that Videology collects and receives through our services, which include Videology’s video advertising and ad targeting solutions and any other technology, products and/or services offered by Videology (collectively referred to as the “Services”), including your past use of the Services. For more information about our Services, please [click here](http://www.videologygroup.com/index.php/en/services.html).

This policy does not apply to information about you collected by third party advertisers and publishers who use Videology’s Services, or other third parties linked to or otherwise accessible via the Services. The information collected or received by any such providers and third parties is subject to their own privacy policies.

**Collection and Use of Information**

_Personal Information_

Videology does not require you to provide personal information in order to use many of the Services. Personal information is information that personally identifies you, such as name, street address and email address. On some of Videology’s web pages, you may be asked to provide personal information, such as when submitting a request for a media kit or requesting that Videology contact you. Additionally, if you enter into a business relationship with Videology, we may require that you provide us with personal information for administrative purposes, such as maintaining account information, preparing invoices and issuing payment. If you do provide us with personal information, your information shall only be used for the purpose for which it is submitted.

_IP Address_

Videology receives IP addresses from all users who view ads we deliver because this information is automatically sent by your browser to us each time we receive an ad request from our web site partners to deliver an ad to a site on which you are viewing content. We use IP address to assist us to both deliver the ad and to select the most appropriate advertising based on geographic area or other information derived from your IP address, such as ISP provider. Aggregate information derived from IP addresses, such as the number of ad impressions delivered to a geographic region, may also be reported to our advertising clients. Finally, we may use IP address to help identify and combat potentially fraudulent activity.

_Non-Personally Identifiable Information_

When you visit a web site that uses our Services and view an advertisement that we’ve sent to that site, Videology uses cookies and other technologies (such as pixels or web beacons) to record and store anonymous information about your interaction with the Services, most commonly known as “click-stream data”. Click-stream data is associated with your computer’s Internet browser (e.g., Microsoft Explorer, Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome) and can include information such as date/time of visit, browser type, web pages visited when viewing an ad we’ve sent in response to a request from one of our web site partners, and information on your interaction with the Services when viewing content on your computer’s Internet browser, including whether you interacted with the advertisement (e.g., viewed the ad to completion or clicked on the ad), and what content you viewed. For more detailed information on cookies and web beacons, please see our [FAQs](http://www.videologygroup.com/index.php/en/privacy-faq.html).

In order to optimize the effectiveness of the Services for our clients, we use cookies to store non-personally-identifiable behavioral and demographic data we receive from third party data providers, publishers and other partners we work with. This anonymous data may include such things as zip code, age, gender and income range, but cannot be tied to an individual and is stored in an encrypted format (e.g., random numbers, letters and symbols).

_Use and Disclosure_

Videology uses non-personal information it receives and collects to customize, target, and measure the effectiveness of the advertisements we deliver to you via the Service (including targeted advertising based on demographic characteristics, viewing preferences and behaviors), to prevent showing you the same ads repeatedly, for reporting on campaign delivery to both advertisers and web site partners, for general reporting purposes (such as the total number of ads delivered by Videology in a given month), and to predict the characteristics and preferences of the audience on sites that use our video advertising Services in order to assist advertisers in targeting their campaigns to the most relevant Internet audience.

Videology uses personal information you provide to us to communicate with and respond to your inquiries, to conduct research about use of the Services; to fulfill your requests for products and services; to help offer you other products, services or offerings that may be of interest to you; and to provide anonymous internal and external reporting. If you choose to provide us with personal information including your email address, we will not use your email address to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of important changes to the Services or for customer service purposes).

Videology will not rent, sell or share information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies, except to provide the Services, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

  * We will provide your information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Videology under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Videology fulfill a transaction you requested or communicate with you about offers from Videology and our marketing partners. However, unless you have granted permission, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.


  * We work with third party vendors, partners, advertisers, publishers, demographic and behavioral data providers and other service and content providers. In order to optimize the Services and to better target advertisements, we may share information about you with them, including statistical and demographic data about our users and their use of the Services. We will not authorize these third party providers to share your information other than as necessary to provide the Services and to enhance user experience through targeting of ads.


  * If Videology, or part(s) of Videology, is acquired or merged with another company we will transfer information about you to the acquiring company.


  * Finally, Videology may share information on individuals it deems necessary to comply with a subpoena or court order, to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, or to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials.



**Third Party Service Providers**

Videology and its advertisers may use third party ad networks and technology providers to help present advertisements via the Services. These third party providers may also use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on your computer to collect click-stream data. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by such third-party providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not Videology's. Please contact them directly for information about their privacy practices. In addition, the  [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) offers useful information about ad networks, including information about how to opt-out of their information collection.

**Access To and Choices About Your Information – Opting Out and Reviewing Your Ad Preferences**

_Cookie Opt-Out & Reviewing Your Ad Preferences_

Videology believes users should have information necessary to make informed decisions and the right to choose how their information is used. We provide you with the ability to opt-out of our use of non-personally identifiable data we receive in order to deliver more relevant advertising, tailored to your interests. To opt-out of Videology cookies, please [click here](http://www.videologygroup.com/index.php/en/privacy-dashboard.html).
