# TIBCO Web Site Privacy Policy

TIBCO Software Inc. ("TIBCO" "we" or "us") is committed to protecting our users' privacy. We feel it is important that you fully understand the terms and conditions under which we use the information we gather from you through the use of our Web sites, including those located at URL www.tibco.com, power.tibco.com, and gi.tibco.com (our "Sites"). Please read this Privacy Policy ("Policy") carefully to understand how we will use and protect your personal information. We will never share your personal information with anyone except as described in this Policy. Changes to this Policy will be announced on our home page of our Web site so please check back periodically.

* ### What information do we collect from you.

In order to better provide you with services, our Site collects two types of information about its visitors: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. We retain Personally Identifiable Information temporarily â€” only as long as it is necessary to carry out services for you. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth and efficient experience while using our Site.

**_Personally Identifiable Information:_** Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that lets a site know the specifics of who you are, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, social security number or credit card number, and any other information when needed to provide a service to you. When you browse our website, you do so anonymously, unless you have previously indicated that you wish TIBCO to remember your login and password. We don't automatically collect personal information, including your email address. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our website you visit and how long you spend there.

TIBCO collects personal information when you register with TIBCO for a TIBCO account as a customer, potential customer or guest user, when you use certain TIBCO products or services, when you register to attend a seminar or participate in an online forum or survey, when you ask to be included in an email or other mailing list, or you submit an entry for promotions, or when you submit your personal information to TIBCO for any other reason. From time to time, TIBCO receives personal information from business partners and vendors. TIBCO only uses such information if it has been collected in accordance with acceptable privacy practices consistent with this Policy and applicable laws.

Access to certain TIBCO web pages require a login and a password. The use of those web pages, and the information or programs downloadable from those sites, may be governed by a written agreement between your employer and TIBCO. Unless you request deletion of your personal information as specified below, your personal information may be retained by TIBCO to verify compliance with the agreement, log software licenses granted, to track software downloaded from those pages, or track usage of other applications available on those pages.

**_Non-Personally Identifiable Information:_** Non-Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon the pages that you access in our Site. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.

* ### With whom do we share your information.

Because TIBCO is a global company, your personal information may be shared with other TIBCO offices or subsidiaries around the world. All such entities are governed by this Privacy Policy or are bound by the appropriate confidentiality and data transfer agreements.

Your personal information is never shared outside TIBCO without your permission, except under conditions explained below. Inside TIBCO, data is stored in controlled servers with limited access. Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country where TIBCO, its subsidiaries, affiliates or agents are located.

TIBCO may send your personal information to other companies or people under any of the following circumstances: when we have your consent to share the information; we need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; we need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of TIBCO to provide a product or service to you (we will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose); or we want to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers or other information we think you'd like to hear about either from us or from our business partners (unless you have opted out of these types of communications). We will also disclose your personal information if required to do so by law, to enforce our Terms of Use, or in urgent circumstances, to protect personal safety, the public or our websites.

* ### How may you update, correct or delete your Personally Identifiable Information.

You may send us an email at [webmaster@tibco.com](mailto:webmaster@tibco.com) or [power-admin@tibco.com](mailto:power-admin@tibco.com), as applicable, to have Personally Identifiable Information that you have submitted to our Site changed or deleted. Note that we may retain changed or deleted information for archival purposes.

* ### What security precautions are in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of your information?

We employ industry-recognized information technology to protect the security of the information you submit to us. The importance of security for all Personally Identifiable Information associated with our users is of utmost concern to us. Our secure servers protect this information using password protection and advanced encryption, and we may use firewall technology for additional protection. Furthermore, all of the user data we collect is protected against unauthorized access by physical security means.

We also encourage our partners and service providers to adopt and follow stringent consumer privacy policies.

* ### "Cookies"

Like many other sites, our Site utilizes a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how our Site is used. A cookie is a small data text file, which a Web site stores on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. Cookies were designed to help a Web site recognize a user's browser as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was browsing the site. For example, cookies can securely store a user's password, personalize home pages, identify which parts of a site have been visited or keep track of past selections.

We use cookies for the limited purposes of enhancing your visit to our Site and to enable us to track and target the interests of our users. A cookie cannot be read by a Web site other than the one that set the cookie. No other company will have access to our cookies. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on a computer virus, or capture your email address.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser to notify you when you have received a cookie, or alternatively, to refuse to accept cookies. It is important to note that you may not be able to use certain features on our Site if you choose not to accept cookies.

* ### Children, Parental Consent and Privacy.

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act took effect on April 21, 2000, and imposes certain requirements on Web sites directed toward children under the age of 13 that collect information on those children, or on Web sites that know they are collecting Personally Identifiable Information on children under the age of 13. Our Site is not directed toward children under age 13. It is our policy not to collect and maintain Personally Identifiable Information from any person under age 13. As explained in Section 2, our Site will temporarily collect emails in order to send links or respond to feedback, but we will delete them after carrying out such services.

* ### You should carefully review privacy policies of any third party sites accessible from our Site.

Other sites accessible through our Site have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. Please consult each site's privacy policy. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties. Please be aware that our Site may contain links to other sites on the Internet that are owned and operated by third parties. The information practices of those Web sites linked to our Site are not covered by this Privacy Policy. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information. We cannot control this collection of information. You should contact these sites directly if you have any questions about their use of the information that they collect.

* ### Contacting us about privacy questions or concerns.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of our Site, or your dealings with our Site, please contact us by sending an email to [webmaster@tibco.com](mailto:webmaster@tibco.com).

* ### Privacy Policy changes.

This Privacy Policy was last changed on July 8, 2004. If we make changes to any terms or conditions of the Privacy Policy, the changes will be posted in this document so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and to whom we will disclose it. Any change, modification, addition or removal of portions of this Policy will be announced on the homepage(s) of our Site. Please be sure to check this page before proceeding to use our Site.
