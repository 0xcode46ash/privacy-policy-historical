## 1\. What information do we collect from you?

In order to better provide you with services, we collect two types of information about its visitors: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. We retain Personally Identifiable Information temporarily — only as long as it is necessary to carry out services for. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth and efficient experience while using our offerings.

**Personally Identifiable Information:** Personally Identifiable Information refers to the specifics of who you are, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address and any other information when needed to provide a service to you while or that could be used to locate you while using our offerings. We log your Internet Protocol ("IP") address to give us an idea of which part of our website you visit and how long you spend there.

TIBCO collects Personally Identifiable Information when you register with TIBCO for a TIBCO account as a customer, potential customer, or guest user, when you use certain TIBCO products or services, when you register to attend a seminar or participate in an online forum, blog, or a voluntary survey, when you ask to be included in an email or other mailing list (see "Choice/Opt-Out" below), when you submit an entry for promotions, or when you submit your Personally Identifiable Information to TIBCO for any other reason. We use the Personally Identifiable Information that we collect to send you information that you have requested, respond to an inquiry, or to facilitate the features in our offerings as described in this Policy. From time to time, TIBCO receives Personally Identifiable Information from business partners and vendors. TIBCO only uses such information if it has been collected in accordance with acceptable privacy practices consistent with this Policy.

When using our Mobile App we will provide you the option to add your location in conjunction with some features of the Mobile App such as adding your location to a post. We ask you to opt into providing us with your Geo-Location data each time you provide it.

### Service

TIBCO collects information on behalf of our Clients and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it possesses when processing this data. The use of this data will be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which our Clients has engaged TIBCO. If you are a customer of one of our Clients and would no longer like to be contacted by them, please contact the Client that you interact with directly. We may transfer Personally Identifiable Information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this Policy regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with our Clients. If you are a customer of one of our Clients and would like to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, direct your inquiry our Client. If the Client requests TIBCO to remove the data, we will respond to that request in 30 days. TIBCO will retain and use this data as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

### Widgets

Our offerings may from time to time utilize widgets, such as the "Share This" or "Add This" buttons, social media, or interactive mini-programs that run in our offerings. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the features to function properly. Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly in our offerings. Your interactions with Widgets are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

### Blogs & Testimonials

If you use the blog or provide testimonials, you should be aware that any Personally Identifiable Information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of the blog, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.

The use of those offerings, and the information or programs downloadable from those sites, may be governed by a written agreement between your employer and TIBCO. Unless you request deletion of your Personally Identifiable Information as specified below, your Personally Information may be retained by TIBCO to verify compliance with the agreement, log software licenses granted, to track software downloaded from those pages, or track usage of other applications available on those pages.

### Email a Friend

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our offerings or invite a colleague into your network, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit us.

## 2\. With whom do we share your information?

Because TIBCO is a global company, your Personally Identifiable Information may be shared with other TIBCO offices or subsidiaries around the world to provide the services that you have requested. All such entities are governed by this Privacy Policy or are bound by the appropriate confidentiality and data transfer agreements.

Your personal information is never shared outside TIBCO without your permission, except under conditions explained below. Inside TIBCO, data is stored in controlled servers with limited access. Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country where TIBCO, its subsidiaries, affiliates, or agents are located.

TIBCO may send your Personally Identifiable Information to other companies or people under any of the following circumstances: when we have your consent to share the information; we need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; we need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of TIBCO to provide a product or service to you such as a marketing partner, mapping service provider or Web analytics company (we will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose); or we want to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers or other information we think you'd like to hear about either from us or from our business partners. We will also disclose your Personally Identifiable Information if required to do so by law, to enforce our Terms of Use, or in urgent circumstances, to protect personal safety, the public or our offerings. We reserve the right to disclose your Personally Identifiable Information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Site.

## 4\. What security precautions are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information?

We employ industry-recognized information technology to protect the security of the information you submit to us. The importance of security for all Personally Identifiable Information associated with our users is of utmost concern to us. Our secure servers protect this information using password protection and advanced encryption, and we may use firewall technology for additional protection. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number, login information for our Service, or Geo-Location information) on our site or through our Mobile App, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

Furthermore, all of the user data we collect is protected against unauthorized access by physical security means.

We also encourage our partners and service providers to adopt and follow stringent consumer privacy policies. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at [privacy@tibco.com](mailto:privacy@tibco.com).

## 5\. "Cookies" and other Tracking Technologies

Like many other sites and mobile apps, our offerings utilize a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how our offerings are used. A cookie is a small data text file, which a Web site or mobile app stores on your computer's hard drive or mobile device (if your Web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. Cookies were designed to help a Web site or mobile app recognize a user's browser as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was browsing the site. For example, cookies can securely store a user's password, personalize home pages, identify which parts of a site or mobile app has been visited, or keep track of past selections.

We use cookies for the limited purposes of enhancing your visit to our Sites or Mobile App and to enable us to track and target the interests of our users. A cookie cannot be read by a Web site or Mobile App other than the one that set the cookie. No other company will have access to our cookies. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or device, pass on a computer virus, or capture your email address. Our cookies are not tied to Personally Identifiable Information.

Most browsers and devices are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser to notify you when you have received a cookie, or alternatively, to refuse to accept cookies. It is important to note that you may not be able to use certain features on our Site if you choose not to accept cookies.

Some of the third party web-monitoring providers use cookies and Web beacons on our Site. We have no access to or control over these tracking technologies.

### Flash LSOs

From time to time we, along with our service providers, may use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences such as volume control, or display content based upon what you view on our site to personalize your visit. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, go to: <http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html>

### Behavioral Targeting / Retargeting

We partner with third parties to either display advertising on our Web sites or to manage our advertising on other sites. These parties may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/) (or if you are located in the European Union, [click here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.

We use Google AdSense to publish ads on this site. When you view or click on an ad a cookie will be set to help better provide advertisements that may be of interest to you on this and other Web sites.

## 6\. Children, Parental Consent, and Privacy

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act took effect on April 21, 2000, and imposes certain requirements on Web sites directed toward children under the age of 13 that collect information on those children, or on Web sites that know they are collecting Personally Identifiable Information on children under the age of 13. Our Sites are not directed toward children under age 13. We do not knowingly collect information from anyone under age 13. If we find out that we have collected information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information immediately.  

## 7\. You should carefully review privacy policies of any third party sites accessible from our Sites

Other sites accessible through our Sites have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. Please consult each site's privacy policy. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties. Please be aware that our Sites may contain links to other sites on the Internet that are owned and operated by third parties. The information practices of those Web sites linked to our Sites are not covered by this Privacy Policy. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit Personally Identifiable Information. We cannot control this collection of information. You should contact these sites directly if you have any questions about their use of the information that they collect.
