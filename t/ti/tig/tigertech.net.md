# Tiger Technologies Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy**  
  
We're aware of the growing concern of Internet users regarding the widespread distribution of their personal information. This privacy policy describes how we collect and use such information. 

**Personal Information**  
  
We request personal information (such as your name, address, and e-mail address) if you sign up for one of our domain name or Web hosting services. We do not request, collect or store personal information if you merely browse our Web site or search for available domain names. 

If you choose to sign up for a domain name, we (like all other domain name registration companies) are required to supply contact information to the domain registrar. That information is then governed by the registrar's [domain registration agreement](https://web.archive.org/domainagreement.shtml#DRA), which may allow them to make the information available by the public WHOIS service. If this is a concern, we recommend using a PO Box or work address when you sign up for a domain name with us. 

We may provide your contact information to other parties for legal reasons (for example, in response to a court order or request from a law enforcement agency, or to resolve an apparent violation of our Terms of Service). 

We will not share your contact information with third parties for other reasons. In particular, we do not sell or trade customer information for marketing purposes. 

After you sign up, we will not send you e-mail or postal mail unrelated to the service you purchased. Instead, the information you supply is used by us for only these purposes: 

  1. After you order, we send one or more e-mail messages confirming the order, with instructions on how to get started. 
  2. As long as you are a customer, we may occasionally send update notices that are primarily related to the service you purchased. For example, from time to time we send notices of new features available to our Web hosting customers. These messages sometimes include other promotional announcements about our company, although such announcements will not be the focus of the message. 
  3. If you purchase a service that expires after a certain time period (such as a one-year "domain name only" service), we may send you renewal notices by either e-mail or postal mail. 



   
**Cookies**  
  
A few pages on our Web site use "cookies". A cookie is a unique number generated by our server that allows us to remember your progress from page to page as you move through our Web site. This allows us to offer features such as the ability to remember the password used to login to your account management pages. 

Cookies cannot be used to reference any personal information unless you supply it yourself by typing it, and the type of cookies we use cannot track you once you leave our Web site. 

   
**Encryption**  
  
In order to further protect customer information, certain forms on our web site are run on a secure server, utilizing encryption technology to safeguard all credit card transactions from unauthorized viewing. We use industry-standard SSL encryption. 

   
**Summary**  
  
These measures, along with our belief that it is up to the individual to determine who receives and what may be done with their personal information, ensure that we will do our best to protect your privacy. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at [support@tigertech.net](mailto:support@tigertech.net).
