# Tiger Technologies Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy**  
  
We're aware of the growing concern of Internet users regarding the widespread distribution of their personal information, and we take great measures to protect our customers' and visitors' privacy. 

**Personal Information**  
  
We request personal information (such as your name, address, and e-mail address) if you choose to purchase one of our programs, or if you sign up for one of our domain name or Web hosting services. We do not request, collect or store personal information if you merely browse our Web site, download a trial version of one of our programs, or search for available domain names. 

If you choose to purchase one of our programs or services and you supply the requested information, we never sell, trade, or otherwise share any of this information with any other company or organization. 

The only exception is for customers who purchase a domain name. For those customers, we are legally required to supply contact information to the domain registrar, and that information is then governed by the registrar's [domain registration agreement](http://hosting.tigertech.com/domainagreement.html#TOS). 

After your purchase, we will not send you e-mail or postal mail unrelated to the product or service you purchased. Instead, the information you supply is used by us for only these purposes: 

  1. After you order, we send a single e-mail message or postcard confirming the order, with instructions on how to get started. 
  2. Unless you request otherwise, we may occasionally send update message notices that are primarily related to the program or service you purchased. For example, from time to time we send notices of free updates to our software programs, or of new features available to our Web hosting customers. These messages sometimes include other promotional announcements about our company, although such announcements will not be the focus of the message. You can send an e-mail message to [support@tigertech.com](mailto:support@tigertech.com) to be removed from this list if you prefer. 



   
**Tell A Friend Feature**  
  
Our Web site includes a [Tell a Friend](https://web.archive.org/tellafriend.html) feature that allows you to send free trial versions of our software to your friends. It requires you to provide your name and e-mail address, as well as your friend's name and e-mail address. 

This information, as well as your IP address, is stored on our servers for about a month to allow us to trace anybody using the system to harass others. We do not use this information for marketing or any other purposes. The information is permanently deleted after about a month. 

   
**Cookies**  
  
A few pages on our Web site use "cookies". A cookie is a unique number generated by our server that allows us to remember your progress from page to page as you move through our Web site. This allows us to offer features such as the ability to resume ordering where you left off if you are disconnected. 

Cookies cannot be used to reference any personal information unless you supply it yourself by typing it, and cookies cannot track you once you leave our Web site. 

You can use our Web site with cookies disabled in your browser if you wish. 

   
**Encryption**  
  
In order to further protect customer information, certain forms on our web site are run on a secure server, utilizing encryption technology to safeguard all credit card transactions from unauthorized viewing. We use industry-standard SSL encryption. 

   
**Summary**  
  
These measures, along with our belief that it is up to the individual to determine who receives and what may be done with their personal information, ensure that any information submitted on our site will be kept confidential. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at [support@tigertech.com](mailto:support@tigertech.com).
