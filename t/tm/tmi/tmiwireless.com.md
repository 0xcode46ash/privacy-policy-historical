**Our Privacy Policy**  
tmiwireless.com is committed to protecting the private information of our customers and visitors. If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy, feel free to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20020605042430id_/http%3A//www.tmiwireless.com/help/contact.asp) with your concerns.   
   
**General Terms**  
tmiwireless.com will never willfully disclose any personally identifiable information about our customers to any third party without first receiving the user's permission. Personally identifiable information that is provided in connection with an order request or in connection with a newsletter subscription request will be used only for internal marketing and promotional purposes. If a site visitor does not want this information collected and used by us for the disclosed internal purposes, the visitor is given an opportunity to "opt-out" at the time when the information is initially collected.   
   
**What happens when you purchase from tmiwireless.com?**  
We take the protection of your personal information very seriously and make every effort to maintain tight security. When you place an order from us, we securely store that information in a password-protected database so that we may process your order. After we process your order, we delete certain personal information entirely such as your credit card number, social security number, date of birth, and drivers license. We do not keep any record of that information. It is solely used to approve you for AT&T Wireless service. Another policy we implement mandates that none of your most personal information (SSN, credit card number, drivers license, etc) may EVER be included in ANY email correspondence. In other words, we NEVER include that information when communicating with you or internally via email. You may want to ask other companies whether they take this precaution! Contact us for more information regarding our privacy policy. We are more than happy to educate you about our way of doing business and want you to feel safe & secure when shopping at tmiwireless.com!   
   
**Why do we ask for your SSN, Date of Birth, and Drivers License Number?**  
When you purchase a phone and sign up for a calling plan, AT&T Wireless (or any other carrier such as Verizon, Sprint, etc.) will need to perform a simple credit check to make sure that you do not have a negative record when it comes to paying bills. They do this because they trust you as a customer to pay your monthly bill for the usage of your wireless phone. The sad fact is that a small percentage of customers abuse this trust and never pay for the services they use, costing them a poor credit rating as well as millions of dollars lost by AT&T Wireless. This simple credit check usually takes about 1 minute and requires information such as your SSN, date of birth, and drivers license or personal ID number. If your credit score comes back below a certain level, AT&T Wireless may require a deposit (this typically ranges from $100 - $400 and is refunded to you after 12 months). However, for most people with good credit, no deposit will be required.
