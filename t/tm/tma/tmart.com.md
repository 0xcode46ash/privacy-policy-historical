When you enter Tmart.com, any personal information including, address, telephone number, Social Security or EIN number, account number or other information that personally identifies you, is secured through data encryption technology.

Cookies  
Cookie technology can provide you with tailored information while visiting a Web site. Cookies are data elements that a Web site can send to your browser and are stored on your system. Some Web site pages use cookies to better serve you when you return to our Site. The Site cookie sent to your address contains what country location you have selected and if you have selected on-line settings for visiting the Site. The Site does not store individual names, email addresses, street addresses, credit card numbers, or phone numbers in cookies placed on your computer. However, the Site does collect non-identifiable information from visits to our Site to help us provide better customer service. For example, we track the domains people visit and we measure visitor activity on the Site, but we do so in ways that keep personal information non-identifiable. Tmart.com uses this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service.
