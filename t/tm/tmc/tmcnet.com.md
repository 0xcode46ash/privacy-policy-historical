**TMCnet.com Privacy Policy  
**Updated 05/23/00

TMCnet.com is concerned about the privacy of its users and is committed to providing a secure environment for the free flow of ideas.

The areas of this site are open to all visitors to read, search, browse, and download, at no cost. 

Visitors need not register or give any personal identification to use this site. No software or hardware techniques are employed to capture a visitor's e-mail address. We do not collect or in any way use the e-mail addresses involved in our "E-mail this article to a friend" feature. 

"Cookies" are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. We **do not** use cookies to track how you use our site. We employ a simple count system that tells us how many visits the site receives in a given period, but no identities or individually identifiable information is gathered by this process. 

The exception to this policy is that cookies are used in our online TMC Bookstore in order to store your TMC Bookstore account number and to enhance your overall shopping experience. 

Where visitors choose to provide the site with an e-mail address in order to receive e-mail newsletters, TMCnet.com may use the information for marketing and promotional purposes by TMC only, unless you opt-in to receive information or offers from companies we believe may be of interest to you. You may manage your e-mail subscriptions at any time, including removing yourself from all our e-mail lists, by going to [www.tmcnet.com/emailsubs/emailsubsmain.asp](http://www.tmcnet.com/emailsubs/emailsubsmain.asp). 

When visitors give their names and addresses to subscribe to our print magazines, they may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products and services or upcoming events. 

By giving us your information, you consent to the collection and use of this information by TMC. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. 

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with TMCnet.com, you can contact our Webmaster at [webmaster@tmcnet.com](mailto:webmaster@tmcnet.com).
