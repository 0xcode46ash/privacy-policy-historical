# TCF Bank - TCF Privacy Policy

**TCF's Commitment**

The TCF financial service providers - TCF BANK and its affiliated companies - understand that you expect your non-public personal financial information to be kept private and secure. We respect your concern about privacy, and we know you place your trust in us. TCF has been a trusted name for over 75 years, and we are committed to continuing this tradition and to earning your trust every day.

**The TCF Privacy Policy**

Please take a few moments to read about how we protect, collect, and use your non-public personal information and how we may share the information. This policy applies only to information obtained in connection with products or services primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.

**What Information We Collect When You Visit Our Website**

**When you browse:** When you visit the TCF website and browse, we do not collect any information about you. We do record the date and time of visits to our website and the pages visited while at our site. We do this to determine which pages are visited most often, so we can enhance our website to make it more useful to our customers.

**When you want information or perform online transactions:** When you visit the TCF website and request information or want banking transactions, we collect the information we believe is necessary to safely process the transaction. For example, for TCF Totally Free Online, you will be asked to enter your secret code and account number. For TCF Preferred Online you will be asked to enter your user I.D. and password. Our Internet Security policy more fully describes the information we collect to identify you for Internet banking transactions. We need to identify you to prevent access to your information by unauthorized persons. When you request information or want banking transactions, we may also collect information to help us understand your financial needs in order to offer you helpful products and services. For example, if we know that you own a home, we may offer you a home equity loan. We do this by collecting identifying information (such as your name and address), information from your application (such as your assets), transaction information with us (such as your loan repayment history) and information to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Federal law requires us to collect a tax identification number, such as a social security number, for accounts, which pay interest. We may also collect information to design new products or services, or modify existing products or services, in order to meet the needs of our customers.

**How TCF Collects Customer Information**

You will enter data that is collected by TCF. In addition to the information you provide, we may collect information from consumer reporting agencies or your transaction history with us. In addition, we record certain information about you based on what you do in our website. For example, we will record the date and time you visited and the pages you visited. We use this information to compile research to better serve our customers.

**Use of "Cookie" Technologies**

Some websites including TCF, place permanent cookies, or permanent electronic files, on your hard drive; the cookies collect data. We occasionally use permanent cookies and place a permanent electronic file on your computer. This means you may not have to re-enter your personal identification information each time you want to bank over the Internet with us.

We also use temporary cookies, which are automatically deleted at the end of a session or expire within 24 hours. These cookies improve the quality of your browsing experience by performing technical tasks such as web server performance, security and enabling you to enter your personal identifying information less frequently during a banking session with us.

If your browser lets you, you may decline our cookies, but if you do you may not be able to access all the features of our website including online banking and bill payment and you will have to enter your personal identifying information more frequently during a session.

**How We Use the Information We Collect**

We collect identifying information (such as your password or secret code) in online banking transactions to help us confirm you are the owner of the account. If you do not provide the information we ask for, you will not be able to use our online banking services.

We may also use the information we collect about you to offer you products and services. See "Sharing Your Information" below.

**Accuracy of Customer Information**

TCF has established audit procedures to maintain the accuracy and integrity of account and personal information. If you believe the account or personal information we maintain is incorrect, or if you would like to review your account or personal information, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20040402081102id_/http%3A//tcfbank.com/cu_home.htm).

These systems are designed to guard against unauthorized access and use of customer information by unauthorized individuals. We work to upgrade these features on an ongoing basis. See [Internet Security](https://web.archive.org/web/20040402081102id_/http%3A//tcfbank.com/ps_prote.htm) for additional information regarding the steps we have taken to ensure your online banking transactions are secure.

We may also share non-public personal information about you with third parties who are not part of the TCF affiliated companies for service and joint marketing reasons and when allowed by law.

**Sharing Your Information With Service Providers**

We may hire companies to provide materials or to perform some services for us. For example, we hire non-TCF companies to print checks for your checking account. To enable these service providers to perform the services for which we hire them, we need to give them some or all of the information described in the "What Information We Collect About You" section above. Our service providers are not permitted to use any information we share with them about you for any purpose except to perform those services.

**Sharing Your Information for Joint Marketing**

We may enter into agreements with other financial institutions (for example, banks, investment firms, and insurance companies, mortgage companies, brokerage houses) to jointly market products or services between us. In order to offer these products or services to you, we may share all of the information we collect, as described under "What Information We Collect About You" above, with companies that perform these marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements.

**Sharing Your Information When Permitted or Required by Federal or State Law**

We may share your information with other parties when permitted or required by federal or state law. For example, we share information in order to protect against fraud, report transactions to consumer reporting agencies, respond to subpoenas, and when you ask us to.

We may always share your information as described in this section for Service and Joint Marketing Reasons, and When Permitted or Required by Federal or State Law, even if you ask us not to (even if you opt-out).

**Sharing Information About Former Customers**

When a TCF account has been closed, information about the account remains in our files. Although we use non-public personal information about former customers less and less over time, the same policies about sharing described above apply to former customers' non-public personal information, and we take exactly the same care in how we collect, use, and protect information about former customers as we do about current customers.

**Employee Access to Customer Information**

We restrict access to non-public personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information to perform their job at TCF. Our employees are trained to respect customer privacy and to access customer information only when they have a business reason to know the information. Our employees are subject to discipline for violating our Privacy Policy.

**Confidentiality and Security**

TCF maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your non-public personal information.

**TCF Is Committed To Honoring Your Privacy Requests**

If you prefer that we not share non-public personal information about you with third parties who are not affiliated with TCF, you may opt out of the sharing. That is, you may direct us not to share the information. If you wish to opt-out of sharing information with third parties who are not affiliated with TCF, [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20040402081102id_/http%3A//tcfbank.com/privacy_optout.htm).

If you opt-out, we will not share non-public personal information we obtain from your application or information we obtain from consumer reporting agencies with other TCF companies except that we will continue to share, within the TCF companies, your identification and contact information from your application.

We will also continue to share, within the TCF companies, information about our experiences or transactions with you. In addition, we will share your information with other TCF companies when you ask us to. This opt-out does not affect our right to share your non-public personal information with companies outside the TCF companies.

  * **Information Shared Outside of the TCF Companies.**

You also have the right to opt-out of sharing your non-public personal information with non-TCF companies. If you opt-out we will not share non-public personal information we collect about you described under "What Information We Collect About You" above.
