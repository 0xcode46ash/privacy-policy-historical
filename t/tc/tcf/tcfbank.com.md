# TCF Bank

TCF Bank and its affiliated companies - - the TCF family of financial service providers - - understand that you expect your financial information to be kept private and secure. We have taken the following steps to ensure your privacy is protected. 

**Access to Customer Information**   
TCF has policies and procedures designed to protect your customer information from illegal access or use. We review these procedures on an ongoing basis and work to update them as needed to accommodate changing business environments and new products and services. 

**Employee's Access to Customer Information**   
Our employees are trained to respect customer privacy and to access customer information only when they have a business reason to know the information. Our employees are subject to discipline for violating our Privacy Policy. 

**What Information We Collect When You Visit Our Website**

**When you browse:** When you visit the TCF website and browse, we do not collect any information about you. We do record the date and time of visits to our website and the pages visited while at our site. We do this to determine which pages are visited most often, so we can enhance our website to make it more useful to our customers 

**When you want information or perform online transactions:** When you visit the TCF website and request information or want banking transactions, we collect the information we believe is necessary to safely process the transaction. For example, for online banking, you will be asked to enter your password and account number. Our Internet Security policy more fully describes the information we collect to identify you for Internet banking transactions. We need to identify you to prevent access to your information by unauthorized persons. 

When you request information or want banking transactions, we may also collect information to help us understand your financial needs in order to offer you helpful products and services. For example, if we know that you own a home, we may offer you a home equity loan. We do this by collecting identifying information (such as your name and address), information from your application (such as your assets), transaction information with us (such as your loan repayment history) and information from consumer reports (such as credit reports from credit bureaus). We also collect information to comply with applicable laws and regulation. For example, federal law requires us to collect a tax identification number, such as a social security number, for accounts which pay interest. We may also collect information to design new products or services or modify existing products or services, in order to meet the needs of our customers. 

**How TCF Collects Customer Information**

You will enter data that is collected by TCF. In addition to the information you provide, we may collect information from consumer reporting agencies or your transaction history with us. In addition, we record certain information about you based on what you do in our website. For example, we will record the date and time you visited and the pages you visited. We use this information to compile research to better serve our customers. 

**Use of "Cookie" Technologies**

Some websites place permanent cookies, or permanent electronic files, on your hard drive; the cookies collect data. We do not use permanent cookies or place any permanent electronic file on your computer. This means you will have to re-enter your personal identification information each time you want to bank over the Internet with us. However, we do use session cookies, which are automatically deleted at the end of a session. Session cookies enable you to enter your password less frequently during a banking session with us. If your browser lets you, you may decline our cookies, but if you do you may not be able to access all the features of our website including online banking and bill payment and you will have to enter your password more frequently during a session. 

**How We Use the Information We Collect**

We collect identifying information (such as your password) in online banking transactions to help us confirm you are the owner of the account. If you do not provide the information we ask for, you will not be able to use our online banking services. 

We may also use the information we collect about you to offer you products and services. See "Sharing of Customer Information" below. 

**Accuracy of Customer Information**

TCF has established audit procedures to maintain the accuracy and integrity of account and personal information. If you believe the account or personal information we maintain is incorrect, or if you would like to review your account or personal information, please [**_contact us_**](https://web.archive.org/web/20001212101300id_/http%3A//tcfbank.com/cu_home.htm).

**Fair Credit Reporting Act Notice**

Please note that "Consumer report information" does not include, and we will continue to share, identifying, transaction and experience, and application information even if you send us a notice. 

**What is a consumer report?** A consumer report is any written, oral, or other communication from a consumer reporting agency which bears on a consumer's credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general, reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living which is used or expected to be used in whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumer's eligibility for: (a) credit or insurance to be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes; (b) employment purposes; or (c) any other purpose authorized under section 604 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

**Sharing Customer Information with Other Companies**

We may also share information about our customers with companies that are not affiliated with TCF in order for those companies to offer their products and services to you. You may always accept or decline any of these product offerings with no impact to your relationship with us. 

When we share information with unaffiliated companies, we do not give them your account numbers or access codes. We give them only the information necessary to market their products to you, such as your identifying information (such as name and address); transaction and experience information (such as whether you have a deposit or loan account with us), and information from your application (such as whether you have stock investments). If you do not want us to share information with companies who are not affiliated with us, write to us at TCF Bank, Attn: Bank Central, 801 Marquette Avenue, Minneapolis, MN 55402, or [**_contact us_**](https://web.archive.org/web/20001212101300id_/http%3A//tcfbank.com/cu_home.htm). 

**Types of companies** We may share with include insurance companies, mortgage companies, and other financial product or service providers. 

**Sharing Customer Information for Business, Service or Special Reasons**

We also share information about our customers with parties outside TCF in other circumstances. 

  * We share information which is necessary, in our judgment, to conduct our business and service your account. 
  * We share information when we believe it is necessary in order to protect against fraud or other financial abuse, in connection with credit reporting or in connection with an acquisition or sale. 
  * We may also release information to law enforcement or to government agencies, or to another party (for example, in response to a subpoena) when we believe it is legally required to do so. 
  * We also sometimes contract with outside agents or service providers, such as check printers and data processors, to print checks, provide audit services, enter or calculate transactions and balances, or help provide other materials or services on our behalf. When we share information with these agents and service providers, we seek to have them agree to safeguard our information about you and your products or services with us and abide by applicable law and regulations. 
  * We also occasionally decide to sell business assets or a business line, such as mortgage servicing rights. In these cases, we may transfer to the purchaser the related account information. 
  * There may be other cases where it becomes necessary, in our judgment, to disclose information in order to conduct our business. 



**Sharing of Former Customer Information**

We share information about former customers the same way we share information about current customers. For example we share identifying information (such as name and address), transaction and experience information (such as loan repayment or overdraft history), application information (such as income and assets), and consumer report information (such as information from credit reports from credit bureaus). 

We share this information with all TCF companies. Examples of TCF companies are a bank, a mortgage company, an annuity agency, an insurance agency, and a mutual fund sales company. 

Except for consumer report information, we also share this information with companies that are not affiliated with TCF. Types of companies we share with are financial product or service providers, such as insurance companies and mortgage companies. 

**Security**

We use industry standards to safeguard your personal identifying information, such as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol and fire walls. These systems are designed to guard against unauthorized access and use of customer information by unauthorized individuals. We work to upgrade these features on an ongoing basis. See [**_Internet Security_**](https://web.archive.org/web/20001212101300id_/http%3A//tcfbank.com/ps_secre.htm) for additional information regarding the steps we have taken to ensure your online banking transactions are secure.
