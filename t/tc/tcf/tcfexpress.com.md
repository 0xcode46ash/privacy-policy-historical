# TCF Bank

The TCF family of financial service providers - TCF BANK and its affiliated companies - understand that you expect your financial information to be kept private and secure. We have taken the following steps to ensure your privacy is protected. This policy applies only to products or services primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.

**What Information We Collect When You Visit Our Website**

**When you browse:** When you visit the TCF website and browse, we do not collect any information about you. We do record the date and time of visits to our website and the pages visited while at our site. We do this to determine which pages are visited most often, so we can enhance our website to make it more useful to our customers.

**When you want information or perform online transactions:** When you visit the TCF website and request information or want banking transactions, we collect the information we believe is necessary to safely process the transaction. For example, for online banking, you will be asked to enter your password and account number. Our Internet Security policy more fully describes the information we collect to identify you for Internet banking transactions. We need to identify you to prevent access to your information by unauthorized persons.

When you request information or want banking transactions, we may also collect information to help us understand your financial needs in order to offer you helpful products and services. For example, if we know that you own a home, we may offer you a home equity loan. We do this by collecting identifying information (such as your name and address), information from your application (such as your assets), transaction information with us (such as your loan repayment history) and information to comply with applicable laws and regulation. For example, federal law requires us to collect a tax identification number, such as a social security number, for accounts which pay interest. We may also collect information to design new products or services or modify existing products or services, in order to meet the needs of our customers.

**How TCF Collects Customer Information**

You will enter data that is collected by TCF. In addition to the information you provide, we may collect information from consumer reporting agencies or your transaction history with us. In addition, we record certain information about you based on what you do in our website. For example, we will record the date and time you visited and the pages you visited. We use this information to compile research to better serve our customers.

**Use of "Cookie" Technologies**

Some websites place permanent cookies, or permanent electronic files, on your hard drive; the cookies collect data. We do not use permanent cookies or place any permanent electronic file on your computer. This means you will have to re-enter your personal identification information each time you want to bank over the Internet with us. However, we do use session cookies, which are automatically deleted at the end of a session. Session cookies enable you to enter you password less frequently during a banking session with us. If your browser lets you, you may decline our cookies, but if you do you may not be able to access all the features of our website including online banking and bill payment and you will have to enter you password more frequently during a session.

**How We Use the Information We Collect**

We collect identifying information (such as your password) in online banking transactions to help us confirm you are the owner of the account. If you do not provide the information we ask for, you will not be able to use our online banking services.

We may also use the information we collect about you to offer you products and services. See "Sharing of Customer Information" below.

**Accuracy of Customer Information**

TCF has established audit procedures to maintain the accuracy and integrity of account and personal information. If you believe the account or personal information we maintain is incorrect, or if you would like to review your account or personal information, please [**contact us**](https://web.archive.org/web/20010331014406id_/http%3A//tcfexpress.com/cu_home.htm).

These systems are designed to guard against unauthorized access and use of customer information by unauthorized individuals. We work to upgrade these features on an ongoing basis.
