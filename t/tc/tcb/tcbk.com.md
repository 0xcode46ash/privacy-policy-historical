> We will tell you the sources of the information we collect about you. We will tell you what measures we take to secure that information. 
> 
> _**Nonpublic personal information**_ means information about you that we collect in connection with providing a financial product or service to you. Nonpublic personal information does not usually include information that is available from public sources, such as telephone directories or government records. In this Notice, we will use the term "information" to mean non-public personal information as defined in this section. 
> 
> An _**affiliate**_ is a member of our corporate family. 
> 
> A _**nonaffiliated third party**_ is a person we do not employ or a company that is not an affiliate of ours. This is also known as nonaffiliated third party, or simply, an "other party." Please note that nonaffiliated third parties may have access to information about you that has been obtained independently, such as through credit bureaus or public records. 
> 
> **COLLECTING INFORMATION TO CONDUCT YOUR BUSINESS**
> 
> We collect information about you from the following sources: 
> 
>   * Information you give us on applications or other forms
>   * Information about your transactions with us
>   * Information about your transactions with our affiliates
>   * Information about your transactions with other parties
>   * Information from a consumer reporting agency
>   * Information we receive through our Customer Identification Program

> 
> **SECURITY PRACTICES TO PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION**
> 
> We restrict access to information about you to those employees who need to know that information in order to provide products or services to you. Employees who have access to your information are required to protect and keep it confidential. Additionally, we use technology designed to keep your information and transactions private and secure, including when you use our Internet Banking service for your on-line banking and bill payment transactions. 
> 
> **HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**
> 
> We will not share information about you to anyone outside of our corporate family except as disclosed in this policy or as permitted by law. For example, customer information on loan applications helps us make loans that meet federal banking regulations. Information on your signature card enables us to order your checks from a check printer when you request them. Your information can help protect your accounts from fraud, help resolve customer disputes, or protect property you have pledged as collateral for a loan. 
> 
> We may also share all of your information that we collect with companies that perform marketing services on our behalf, and to certain of our own employees, who are also authorized representatives of other financial service providers, such as Raymond James Financial Services with whom we have carefully structured arrangements. These companies work jointly with us to provide a service or product we are unable to provide for you solely within our own company. We are allowed to do this only if they have entered into a joint marketing contract with us, which prohibits the sharing of your information for their own unrelated marketing purposes. Examples of such products and services include alternative investment products, such as mutual funds or annuities, or life and casualty insurance products that protect life and property. In these instances, employees have access to information such as your name, address, social security number, assets, income, telephone number, and your transaction activity with us, such as account balances, payment and deposit history. We will utilize only the information that we deem appropriate to offer you these special products and services. You can't opt out of this kind of information sharing. 
> 
> **COLLECTING INFORMATION ABOUT FORMER CUSTOMERS**
> 
> We do not disclose information about former customers, except as permitted or required by law.
> 
> **CHANGING OUR PRIVACY POLICY IN THE FUTURE**
> 
> We reserve the right to amend or change our policy at any time, but if we do this, we will mail a new policy to our current customers at least 30 days prior to implementing the change, allowing you time to review and act on the new changes. 
>
