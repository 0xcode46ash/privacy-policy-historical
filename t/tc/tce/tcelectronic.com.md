# Privacy Policy - Corporate | TC Electronic

## Privacy Policy

Protecting your privacy is important to TC companies. We strive to keep your personal information confidential. By ensuring that you are aware of and understand the TC Customer Privacy Policy, we can provide you with better service. Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn how we handle your personal information.

**Why we collect personal information**  
TC collects and uses your personal information to give you superior customer service, to provide you with convenient access to our products and services, and to make a wider range available to you. In addition, we use your personal information to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers, and other information we think you'd like to hear about. From time to time, we may also use your personal information to contact you to participate in a market research survey, so that we can gauge customer satisfaction and develop better products.

Furthermore, TC websites use remarketing through Google AdWords. The information collected is completely anonymized. Still, your privacy is of the utmost importance to us. So if you would like to opt out you can do so via Google's [Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads).

**How we collect personal information**  
We collect information about you in several ways. For example, we might ask for your contact information when you correspond with us, call us to make a purchase or request service, register to attend a seminar, or articipate in an online survey. In addition, when you register a new TC product or ask to be included in an email mailing list, we collect and store the information you provide in a secure database.

TC works with other companies that help us provide TC products and services to you, and we may provide your personal information to these companies. For example, we give shipping companies this information so they can deliver your products efficiently. The information they receive is for shipping and delivery purposes only, and we require that the companies safeguard your personal information in accordance with TC policies.

At times we may be required by law or legal process to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we believe that disclosure is necessary for the public interest. 

**How we protect your personal information**  
TC safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. The TCNOW.com Store uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is required. To make purchases from the TCNOW.com Store, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Netscape Navigator 3.0 or later, or Internet Explorer. This protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it is transmitted over the Internet.

Like many websites, TC websites uses "cookie" technology. When you first connect to our site, the cookie identifies your browser with a unique, random number. The cookies we use do not reveal any personal information about you, except perhaps your first name so we can welcome you on your next visit. Cookies help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how long they spend there. We use cookies to study traffic patterns on our site so we can make the site even better.

In some of our email to you, we use a "click-through URL." When you click one of these URLs, you pass through our web server before arriving at the website that is your destination. We track click-throughs to help us determine your interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. 

**Our company wide commitment to privacy  
** To make sure your personal information remains confidential, we communicate these privacy guidelines to every TC employee. TC companies do not knowingly solicit personal information from children or send them requests for personal information.

The TC websites contain links to other sites. TC does not share your personal information with those websites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.

If we are going to use your personal information differently from that stated at the time of collection, we will try to contact you via email using the most recent information we have. If you have not given us permission to communicate with you, you will not be contacted, nor will we use your personal information in a new manner.

The TC Customer Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time. We encourage you to review the privacy policy regularly for any changes.
