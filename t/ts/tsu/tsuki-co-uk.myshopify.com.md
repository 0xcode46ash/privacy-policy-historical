# Privacy Policy – Tsuki

This Privacy Policy was first published and made effective on January 1, 2017.

2583486 ONTARIO INC (“2583486 ONTARIO INC”, “we,” or “us”) provides this Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of information that apply to our Service, as well as your choices regarding the collection and use of information. This Privacy Policy covers the 2583486 ONTARIO INC businesses including the websites that we own or maintain including without limitation shoppewdiepie.com, shopcutiepiemarzia.com, reelstyle.co and any other websites we may acquire or maintain. You understand and agree that any information you provide may be used in connection with any Site we own or maintain.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by means (including offline) or from other sources other than through the Service or Our Site. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Use.

  1. **Information Collection and Use Personally Identifiable Information:**



We collect information that can be used to identify you as an individual (“Personally Identifiable Information”) only when you provide such information directly to us in connection with the Service.

**Information we may collect from you.**

We ask for Personally Identifiable Information such as your name and e-mail address when you register for a customer account with the Service, (including by “following,” “liking,” adding a 2583486 ONTARIO INC application, linking your account to a 2583486 ONTARIO INC service, etc., on a third party website or network) or if you correspond with us (in which case we will also retain our responses). We may also collect demographic information, such as your age, gender, beauty product preferences, and interests. If you purchase products or services or sign up for a paid subscription, then we will also ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service.

**Uses made of the information.**

We use Personally Identifiable Information to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions and special offers. We also use your Personally Identifiable Information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.

If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a third party to the Service, we will ask you for that person’s email address and automatically send an email invitation to the invitee. 2583486 ONTARIO INC stores this information to send this email, to register the invitee if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our invitation service. Unless the invitee becomes a registered user of the Service, 2583486 ONTARIO INC does not use the invitee’s email address for marketing purposes, and does not share the invitee’s email address with third parties other than 2583486 ONTARIO INC’s service providers. The invitee may contact us at any time to request that we remove his or her information from our database at: support [at] shoppewdiepie [dot] zendesk [dot] com.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information:**

We also collect and use information about your interactions with the Service in a manner and format that does not identify you as an individual (“Non-Personally Identifiable Information”). We may collect, use, and disclose Non-Personally Identifiable Information as set forth below.

**Information we may collect from you:**

**Analytics Information.**

We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including the web pages you visit, your browser add-ons, your browser’s width and height, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.

**Cookies Information:**

When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets 2583486 ONTARIO INC help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.

**Log File Information:**

Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you use the Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.

**Clear Gifs/Web Beacons Information:**

When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.

**Uses made of the information.**

We use or may use cookies, log file, and clear gifs information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our Users or engineers that are associated with certain IP addresses; (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; and (h) track User Content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act; (i) serve  **Online Advertising**  (please see below) to your browser or device, and (j) automatically update a 2583486 ONTARIO INC application on your system and related devices.

  1. **Sharing of Your Information**



**Personally Identifiable Information:**

We will not rent or sell your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties outside 2583486 ONTARIO INC and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent, except as noted below:

We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with third-party business partners for the purpose of providing the Service to you. Those business partners will be given limited access to the Personally Identifiable Information that is reasonably necessary to deliver the Service, and we will require that such third parties comply with this Privacy Policy.

Any Personally Identifiable Information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings. To change your privacy settings on the Service please access your customer account page. If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved that information.

We may at any time buy or sell/divest the company, or any combination of its products, services, assets and/or businesses. Personally Identifiable Information such as customer names and email addresses, and other user information related to the Service will likely be one of the items transferred in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions or similar transactions or proceedings.

2583486 ONTARIO INC will disclose Personally Identifiable Information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of 2583486 ONTARIO INC, our Users or others.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information:**

We may share Non-Personally Identifiable Information, including information obtained through tools such as cookies, log files and clear gifs (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with our third-party business partners for the purposes described in the section above on  **“Information Collection and Use.”**

**Online Advertising:**

We may also share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with our business partners to deliver online advertisements (“ads”) that may be of interest to you. 2583486 ONTARIO INC may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser or mobile device, the ads and ad links that appear on the Service. The ad-servers automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, and clear gifs) to compile information about your browser’s or device’s visits and usage patterns on the Service (without using any Personally Identifiable Information), and to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize the advertising content. 2583486 ONTARIO INC does not provide any Personally Identifiable Information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks 2583486 ONTARIO INC to show an ad to a certain audience and you respond to such an ad, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The 2583486 ONTARIO INC Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers or contact such advertisers for more information.
