We and third parties may use automated means to collect information about you, your computer or other device, and your use of the Service. These automated means include cookies, Web server logs, Web beacons and JavaScript, as well as functionality that can collect data from a mobile device.

Cookies are files that websites send to your computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings on your device. Our Service may use HTTP cookies, HTML5 cookies, Flash cookies and other types of local storage (such as browser-based or plugin-based local storage). Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict or disable certain cookies. You also may be able to delete your Flash cookies or adjust your Flash cookie settings by visiting the Adobe Flash Website Storage Settings Manager by following Adobe’s instructions [here](https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html) (instructions vary depending on your operating system and version of Flash).

In conjunction with the gathering of information through cookies, Web servers may log information such as your device type, operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located.

They also may log information about your interaction with our Service, such as which pages you visit. To control which Web servers collect information by automated means, we may place tags on our Web pages called "Web beacons," which are files that link Web pages to particular Web servers and their cookies. We also may include Web beacons in e-mail messages. We or third parties also may send instructions to your device using JavaScript or other computer languages to store or gather the sorts of information described above and other details about your interactions with the Service.

Through our apps, we may collect information similar to the data mentioned above. We also may collect unique device identifiers (for example, advertising IDs) and other mobile-specific types of information. For example, depending on your device settings, we may collect your device’s geolocation.

When you connect an external social network account to your account on our Service, we may collect information from the external social network, such as your public profile, friend list, email address and likes and your friends' photos.

## 4\. Online Analytics, Advertising and Do-Not-Track

### Online Analytics Providers

To help us better understand your use of the Service, we may use third-party analytics on our Service, such as Google Analytics. These third parties use the sorts of technologies described in the “Automatically Collected Information” section above. The information collected by this technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers. (We also may use Google Analytics as described in the following section.) To restrict Google Analytics’ use of your information, you may install the [Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on.](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/)

### Advertising Technology Providers

Data about your activities on our Service may be collected by advertising technology providers for use in delivering advertising tailored to your individual interests on other websites and online services. These ad services may track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of the automated technologies described above, and they may use this information, and other information we provide them, to show you advertisements that are tailored to your individual interests and/or based on prior visits to our Service. We and third-party vendors may use first-party cookies and third-party cookies together, and other automated technologies, and in some cases additional information, (i) to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our Service and (ii) to report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Service.

You may visit the [Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out Link](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/), the [European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance “Your Online Choices” page](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) or the [Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out Link](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) to opt out of receiving tailored advertising based on your Internet browsing activities from companies that participate in those programs. Some of our advertising-related activities may involve the services of companies that do not participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads, you can visit the [Google Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads) page. The opt-outs apply only to the browser in which you set them. For example, if you set the opt-out while using Firefox, but then use Chrome, the opt-out will not be active in Chrome. To opt out in Chrome, you will need to repeat the opt-out process.

The opt-outs do not block or delete cookies, or prevent the use of cookies or other technologies for purposes other than selecting ads based on your interests as inferred by your online behavior. If you opt out, data may still be collected about your web browsing activities and you will still see advertising. Ads may be delivered based on other factors, such as the content of the web page in which they are shown, or demographic information obtained through other means.

Similar data collection takes place via our apps for advertising purposes. Modern versions of Apple iOS and Android provide certain ad-related preferences that will be communicated to companies collecting data for in-app advertisements. For more information, or to use these mechanisms, consult your device settings.

### Do Not Track Disclosure

Some third parties' data collection tools or embedded content or plugins on the Service, such as videos that users post on the Service, may allow their operators to learn about your interaction with our Service, and they may combine this information with other, identifiable information they have collected about your visits to other websites or online services. These third parties may handle this information, and other information they directly collect through their technology, pursuant to their own privacy policies. We do not change our own collection of information in response to web browser "do-not-track" signals or other third-party tools that let consumers exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information. Also, we generally do not require third parties collecting information on our websites and online services to respond to these technologies.
