# Mobile and Secure Online Timesheets and Employee Time Tracking Tools

**Last Updated: January 1, 2015**

Protecting consumer privacy is important to TSheets. This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by TSheets.com, LLC (“TSheets”, "we", "us" or "our"). This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our websites, mobile applications, and other products and services (collectively, the “Services”) or when you otherwise interact with us whether in electronic, paper or verbal format. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information we collect about industry professionals who may provide counseling services to users of our Services.

TSheets is based in the United States and the information we collect is governed by United States ("US") law. By accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing and transfer of information in and to the US and other countries, except in the case of transfers from the European Economic Area or Switzerland, which are covered under the European Union ("EU") Safe Harbor Frameworks.

We adhere to the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Information from European Union ("EU") member countries and Switzerland. TSheets has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles (the "Principles") of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certification page, please visit US Export.gov. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and the Principles, the Principles shall govern. For purposes of the Principles, "Personal Information" is defined as (1) information that is transferred from the EU to the United States; (2) is recorded in any form; (3) is about, or pertains to a specific individual; and (4) can be linked to that individual.

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a statement to our websites or by sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.
