## TSA Privacy Policy

We collect no personal information about you when you visit our Web site unless you choose to provide this information to us. However, we collect and store certain information automatically. Here is how we handle information about your visit to our Web site.

## What We Collect and Store Automatically

If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the Web site, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This information does not identify you personally. We automatically collect and store only the following information about your visit:

  1. The Internet domain (for example, 'xcompany.com' if you use a private Internet access account or “yourschool.edu if you connect from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our Web site;
  2. The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;
  3. The date and time you access our site;
  4. The pages you visit;
  5. If you linked to our Web site from another Web site, the address of that Web site.



We use the information we collect to count the number and type of visitors to the different pages on our site, and to help us make our site more useful to visitors like you.

## Cookies

There are two types of cookies; single session (temporary) and multisession (persistent).  Session cookies last only as long as your web browser is open and are used to temporarily store information about your visit and to track transactions while you are online to permit better navigation. The Office of Management and Budget Memo [_M-10-22, Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies_](http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/asset.aspx?AssetId=2774), allows Federal agencies to use session and persistent cookies.

Persistent cookies are stored on your computer for longer periods.  We use persistent cookies that are categorized by OMB in M-10-22 as “Tier 2 multi-session without Personally Identifiable Information”  to help us gather feedback using aggregated data, such as number of unique visitors to a page and the navigation the visitor took to get to a specific piece of content. We will use this data to make modifications to the site to improve the user experience and to monitor the traffic on our site.  The cookie monitors your navigation through the website and records:

  * What content was viewed
  * How you arrived at the specific content,
  * Your ISP provider including the ISP provider’s country of origin,
  * The time spent viewing a specific piece of content,
  * The time spent on the entire website,
  * The path taken to access the website
  * The connection speed of the session.



 If you do not wish to have session or persistent cookies placed on your computer, you can disable them using your Web browser. If you opt out of cookies, you will still have access to all information and resources at TSA.gov. Instructions for disabling or opting out of cookies in the most popular browsers are located at <http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml>. Please note that by following the instructions to opt-out of cookies, you will disable cookies from all sources, not just those from TSA.gov.

TSA currently uses Google Analytics to perform web measurement and analytics. Google Analytics sets a single session cookie, and three persistent cookies that expire up to 2 years after they are set.

## If You Send Us E-mail

You may choose to provide us with personal information, as in e-mail with a comment or question. We use the information to improve our service to you or to respond to your request. Sometimes we forward your e-mail to other government employees who may be better able to help you.

## Links to Other Sites

Our Web site has links to third-party sites, including other federal agencies, and private organizations or commercial sites. When you visit a link to another site, you are no longer on our site and are subject to the privacy policy of the new site.  TSA uses third-party commercial sites such as Twitter and YouTube to interact with the public on issues related to TSA functions.

TSA does not endorse, support or otherwise promote any private or commercial entity that may be reached through links on our Web site.

This system is monitored to ensure proper operation, to verify the functioning of applicable security features, and for comparable purposes. Anyone using this system expressly consents to such monitoring. Unauthorized attempts to modify any information stored on this system, to defeat or circumvent security features, or to utilize this system for other than its intended purposes are prohibited and may result in criminal prosecution.

## TSA Social Media Comment Policy

Twitter and Instagram  
We encourage the public to share thoughts as they relate to the topics being discussed on all official TSA social media accounts on Twitter and Instagram.

It is not feasible for the Transportation Security Administration to respond to all comments posted on official TSA social media accounts due to volume. The decision to respond will be determined by engagement objectives and available resources while keeping what is in the public’s best interest in mind. If you have a travel related issue or question that needs an immediate answer, you can reach out to the TSA contact center.

Comments and responses posted to any official TSA social media accounts on Twitter and Instagram are subject to the Twitter and Instagram usage policies.

The views expressed in visitor comments reflect those of the comment’s author and do not necessarily reflect the official views of TSA or the federal government.

TSA does not guarantee or warrant that any information posted by individuals is correct, and disclaims any liability for any loss or damage resulting from reliance on any such information. TSA may not be able to verify, does not warrant or guarantee, and assumes no liability for anything posted by any other person. TSA does not endorse, support or otherwise promote any private or commercial entity or the information, products or services contained that may be reached through links posted by others in comments.

TSA does not moderate comments prior to posting, but reserves the right to delete comments that contain:  
•Obscene or threatening language or discrimination targeting individuals or groups;  
•Threats or defamatory statements;  
•Promotion of services or products (not including non-commercial links that are relevant to the topic);  
•Suggestions or encouragement of illegal activity; or  
•Personal or sensitive information (phone numbers, email or postal addresses).

Complaints about abusive comments and removal requests should be sent to [tsablog@tsa.dhs.gov](mailto:tsablog@tsa.dhs.gov).

Do not use TSA Instagram or Twitter accounts to report criminal activity. If you have information for law enforcement, please contact your local police agency.

TSA Instagram or Twitter accounts may not be used for the submission of any claim, demand, informal or formal complaint, or any other form of legal and/or administrative notice or process, or for the exhaustion of any legal and/or administrative remedy.  
Thank you for taking the time to read this comment policy. We encourage your participation in our discussion and look forward to an active exchange of ideas.
