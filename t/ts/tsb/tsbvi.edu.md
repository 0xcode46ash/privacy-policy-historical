# About the TSBVI Web Site

| [Home](https://web.archive.org/web/20000817070154id_/http%3A//www.tsbvi.edu/index.htm) | [Site TOC](https://web.archive.org/web/20000817070154id_/http%3A//www.tsbvi.edu/tsbvi-toc.htm) | [Site Search](https://web.archive.org/web/20000817070154id_/http%3A//www.tsbvi.edu/search.htm) |

This page and the entire TSBVI World Wide Web site strives to be accessible to all people.

### Purpose

The Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired World Wide Web site reflects the schools vision of serving as a leading center of educational expertise for students with visual impairments. The TSBVI website strives to be a model for web site design to ensure the information is accessible to individuals with visual impairments. Such information can be easily transformed into Braille, large print, voice output, and regular text. As a technical information resource, the site will focus on four areas:

> **Training** \- materials to support training and education, announcements of upcoming training events, and provision of on-line training

> **Research** \- provide for the ongoing development and dissemination of research information developed here at TSBVI, within the State of Texas, and elsewhere. It is our hope that such information will coordinate the efforts of professionals working in the classroom, educational center, and academic context

> **Curricula** \- provide for the efficient sharing of information concerning education of students with visual impairments.

> **Technical** \- provide resources for professionals, parents, and lay persons associated with programs for the visually impaired and deaf/blind throughout the state, country, and world

All resources on the TSBVI Web page are in the public domain unless otherwise noted. You are welcome to use these resources as needed provided that the TSBVI Web page is cited as the source. A basic tenet of TSBVI is to promote the collegial sharing of information. You are invited to submit items for publication on the website. In all cases author contact information will be included. In this manner, we hope to build a valuable resource to promote the development of instructional materials and resources.

### Web Site Usability Features

If you have a visual impairment there are many options which you can control from the selection of an accessible browser to modifying your browser to meet your needs. Visit the [Large Print and Speech Access to the World Wide Web.](https://web.archive.org/web/20000817070154id_/http%3A//www.tsbvi.edu/technology/web.htm)

This website strives to follow [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT).

The Texas image on each page will link back to the home page

Every graphics image will have alt text to name the graphic. Where appropriate, a graphic will be followed by a D link that provides an in-depth description of the image

When practical, two dimensional tables will be presented as visual tables and also converted to a linear speech-friendly format. When web technology improves to allow understandable speech access to tables, this convention will be discontinued.
