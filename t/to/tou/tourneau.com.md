# Tourneau | Privacy and Security Policy

**

Our Commitment to Your Privacy

**

Your privacy is important to us.  Tourneau has created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting your privacy and to disclose our information collection and use practices.

**

The Information We Collect

**

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Tourneau web site. We use your IP (Internet protocol) address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our web site, to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information.

As many sites do, we use cookies (a small file kept on your computer) to keep track of certain ordering and request information so you don’t have to re-enter it and to deliver content relevant to your interest. You can disable the cookies by using your browser settings, but your use of our web site may become cumbersome **.** You can order products or catalogs and request preliminary appraisals on some pages. The types of personal information collected at these pages include contact information (e.g., name, address, email address and phone number), financial information (credit/debit card information), information about a timepiece to be appraised (e.g., brand, condition, where and when purchased), and optional demographic, family and personal data such as birth dates, spouse’s name, interest in buying a new watch and current watch brand.

**

How We Use Information

**

We use information you provide about yourself when placing an order or requesting a preliminary appraisal only to complete that order or appraisal. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order or appraisal and as required by law.

On some of our pages, you can submit information about other people. **** Tourneau will not disclose any information you provide about someone else.

You can use our web site to order our catalogs as well as request updates on our new products and services. Information you submit on our web site will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the request form.

We use contact and optional demographics, family and personal data to provide you with information about our products and services, and may also use it, or allow others to use it, to provide promotional material about quality products or services of other companies. You may opt-out of receiving Tourneau and third party promotions (please see "How To Contact Us"), below.

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our web site and may share it with advertisers and manufacturers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our web site, or that Y number

of men and Z number of women filled out our catalog request form but we would not disclose to these advertisers or manufacturers your personally identifiable information.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

Please note that for your protection, your order may be delayed as a result of this verification process. We also use reputable order fulfillment companies to process and deliver your order. We have agreements with all of these companies to ensure that your personal information is kept private. However, please note that your transaction may be canceled if we reasonably determine that the order information you have provided to us is incorrect or fraudulent.
