# Townhall.com :: Privacy Policy

**Townhall.com's Privacy Policy**  
Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. As part of the operation and customization feature of townhall.com, we gather certain types of information from users, and we would like to explain the types of information we gather, what we do with them, and how to correct or change the information.

**Information Collected By townhall.com**  
townhall.com collects two types of information from users: personal data such as zip code, email address and demographic information; and aggregated data such as information about traffic patterns on townhall.com (for example, how many users log on to townhall.com on a daily basis). 

**Personal Data**  
townhall.com allows users to write and send email to their elected officials. Since messages generally are more credible-and therefore more effective-when the author's name and home address are included in the message, townhall.com has provided a template that allows users to input this information neatly on the top of their message. townhall.com does not store or save this information in any way. It is only used one time to stamp the message with the sender's information.

**Aggregated Information**  
Aggregated information, such as which pages users visit, is collected through various means. One of these ways is through an IP address, a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from townhall.com, our servers log your IP address. townhall.com does not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, so although your session will be logged, your session will remain anonymous to us. townhall.com collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to provide aggregate data to advertisers about the volume of use on townhall.com.

**Use of Cookies**  
townhall.com uses cookies to automate the process of logging on to certain areas of the site. The townhall.com cookie is a small data file stored on your computer that contains a single, randomly assigned user ID number. By recognizing this ID number, townhall.com can automatically provide you with the personalized content which you requested. Cookies can neither read any other files on your computer, nor damage your computer. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent.

**Advertising on townhall.com**  
Our ad server may combine demographic data from your registration information with non-personally identifiable information about your clickstream on the townhall.com site. This allows us to serve you targeted advertisements. This ad targeting information is not transferable to other websites. As always, your personally identifiable information will be protected. Townhall.com also uses DoubleClick for some of its ad serving. For information on DoubleClick, visit their privacy statement

**Use of Information Collected by townhall.com**  
townhall.com uses both the personal and aggregated information we collect for multiple purposes. The information is used to improve the content of the site, to customize the content and/or layout of the site for each individual user, and if requested, to provide information services by email to the user. After registration, users will receive a single email message confirming registration. townhall.com will never disclose your personally identifiable information to a third party unless required to do so by court order, law or governmental agency

. 

**Information Security at townhall.com**  
townhall.com employees understand the need for user privacy and the company has appointed a privacy policy administrator to monitor privacy practices. Access to user data is strictly limited and can only be accessed by specific individuals who have the necessary username and password combination. A log is maintained to record who has accessed the data. This log is checked at least weekly for possible security breaches.

**Children and Privacy**  
townhall.com encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children online and to be fully familiar with the sites visited by their children. In general, townhall.com will not contain content that is reasonably considered unsuitable for children.

**Links to Other Sites**  
It is important to note that townhall.com contains links to sites other than townhall.com, and that those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as townhall.com. For instance, if you click on an advertisement on townhall.com, this will take you away from townhall.com to an entirely different site.

**Changes to the Privacy Policy**  
townhall.com reserves the right to change the policy on use of information collected. Any changes in policy will be noted in a revised privacy policy statement and will be posted at least 30 days prior to implementation. You may direct any privacy policy questions to privacy@townhall.com.
