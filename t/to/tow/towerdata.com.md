## **How We Gather Information**

TowerData is in the business of intermediating between consumers who wish to receive highly valuable promotions, goods and services and companies who offer those promotions, goods and services.

We mandate that any company that provides us with data for enhancement services certify that the data represents permissible data that they are allowed to share with us and that we are allowed to use. If we become aware that the data is not in compliance, we will terminate our relationship with that company immediately and destroy that data.
