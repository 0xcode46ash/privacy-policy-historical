We are in the email business and understand the importance of personal information security. We only work with companies that protect the personal information they collect from their existing or potential customers.

**How We Gather Information**

TowerData is in the business of intermediating between consumers who wish to receive highly valuable promotions, goods and services and companies who offer those promotions, goods and services. We collect only the information you voluntarily give us when you register on our website, www.towerdata.com.

In addition, we also obtain information from our business partners and clients. We mandate that any company that provides us with data certify that the data represents permissible email data. If we become aware that the data is not in compliance we will terminate our relationship with that company immediately.

We keep all our customers, and our clients' customers, contact information private and never sell, rent or lease this information to others.
