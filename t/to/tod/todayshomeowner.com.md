**Times Mirror Interzines' Privacy Policy**

The site you are about to view follows the Times Mirror Interzines Privacy Policy. The site is maintained by Times Mirror Magazines Inc., 2 Park Avenue, New York, NY, 10016. 

Times Mirror Interzine (TMI) sites collect no personally identifying information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. In addition, TMI sites may place a "cookie" in the browser files of a user's computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information although it will enable the site to relate a user's use of the site to information that the user has specifically and knowingly provided to TMI. A user's personally identifying information may be used by TMI for editorial purposes. TMI may also use such information for marketing and promotional purposes and may share the information with companies that it has pre-screened. Individuals always have the ability to stop their information from being used for such purposes. 

A user's personally identifying information will not be transferred to any other party unless otherwise stated at the time of collection. While TMI will seek to require third parties with whom it has agreements to follow appropriate privacy policies, TMI does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of such third parties. 

TMI users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, E-mail address) on the bulletin boards that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties. 

KIDS: Be sure to ask your parents for permission before you send any information about yourself to us or anyone else over the Internet. 

PARENTS: Any such information collected by TMI from children is used for editorial participation and feedback purposes, together with any other purposes that will be described where the information is collected, and will not be transferred to any third party. Cookies placed by TMI for use throughout the TMI sites will not be used to collect information in areas within TMI sites that are geared to children.
