# Privacy Policy Statement - Toshiba Europe Region Portal

| 

TOSHIBA of Europe Ltd places great importance on respecting the personal rights of all visitors to its websites.

Please find below our data protection declaration, informing you of the nature and extent of the personal data collected via these websites, as well as the purposes for which this data is processed and used.

#### Webserver - Protocols

When you visit our website, as is usual on almost all websites, our server automatically collects personal information such as your IP address (including the domain name associated with the IP address, i.e. using reverse look-up), the date and time of your visit to our website, the pages you visited on our website and the browser you are using etc. It also stores, where this is available, the country from which you are accessing our website (only the ending is saved (e.g. de), since this indicates the relevant country) the language of the browser you are using, the website from which you are accessing our website, the search word used (if our site is accessed via a search engine), as well as the type of connection and operating system. We use this information to improve constantly your website experience.

#### Personal data you provide:

In general, you do not need to provide personalised information to access our websites. Your personal data, for example your name, address, telephone number, email address, etc., are stored only if you provide us with this information in order to use one of the services on our website (e.g. registering warranties/service, registering for a personalised web experience, signing up for the newsletter (e-mail only) or taking part in competitions). This data is then processed and used to perform the requested services. In addition, this data is only processed and used for other purposes (e.g. sending additional information about our company and products) if you have given us your advance consent to do so. Your consent is also required to transmit your personal data to third parties outside the legally permitted circumstances.

On some sites we use a “double opt-in system”. This means that when you first register with us, you are sent a confirmation email containing your login details. You then need to use these details to access our website. Your registration is not activated until you have logged in with your user name and password.

#### Right of access to personal data and withdrawing consent

You have the right to receive a copy of your stored personal data at any time. In addition, you are entitled to withdraw your consent with future effect at any time. Please use the address provided under Contacts to do so.

  


#### Protecting the privacy of minors

Our websites are not addressed to children and young people under the age of 14. Children and young people under the age of 14 may not transmit any personal data over the Internet without the consent of their parent or guardian. We ensure that we do not knowingly store any personal data relating to minors.

  


#### Cookies

Some of our websites use cookies to track users’ preferences and structure the website optimally. Cookies are small files which are stored temporarily on your hard disk (session-based cookies). These cookies exist only until the end of the Internet session. They are used for navigation and increase the user friendliness of a website. You can still use some of our website even if you do not want cookies to be created on your computer. However, please note that some functions may be restricted and/or some websites will not be available. Most browsers accept cookies automatically. However, you can prevent this by setting your browser to block all cookies. For details, please refer to the instructions provided by your browser manufacturer.

  


#### Links to other websites

Our websites contain links to other websites where you can find out more about other Toshiba Corporation products, other group companies or our partners. Please note that this data protection declaration does not apply to such linked websites.

  


#### Security

Toshiba has implemented technical and organisational security measures to guarantee the security of your personal information. Users’ personal information is stored in our secure networks and access is restricted to those employees and partners who are entitled to access our systems.

In areas where you enter data we work with the “Secure Socket Layer” (SSL) standard encryption system. Please note that your browser must support encryption protection. You can find this, for example, in Internet Explorer version 3.0 or a higher version and most other browsers. Data is stored in databases which are protected against unauthorized access by security firewalls and software. Whenever your browser displays a closed padlock symbol at the bottom of the screen, or a similar icon/highlighted web address in a different browser, this indicates that your data is being transmitted in an encrypted format.

If the SSL system is not available for technical reasons, an error page is displayed to ensure that under no circumstances can your data be transmitted without encryption.

#### Data processing in countries outside the European Economic Area

No personal data collected via this website is processed outside the European Economic Area.

• wish to correct, delete or block your personal data  
• wish to obtain information about the personal data we have stored about you
