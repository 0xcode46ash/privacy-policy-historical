Toshiba places great importance on respecting the personal rights of all visitors to its websites and users of online communication services. 

Please find below our DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION, informing you of the nature and extent of the personal data collected via these websites and online communication services, as well as the purposes for which this data is processed and used.

When you visit our website, as is typical on almost all websites, our server automatically collects personal information such as your IP address (including the domain name associated with the IP address, i.e. using reverse look-up), the date and time of your visit to our website, the pages you visited on our website, the browser you are using, etc. It also stores, where available, the country from which you are accessing our website (only the ending is saved, e.g. "de" for Germany since this indicates the country), since this indicates the relevant country), the language of the browser you are using, the website from which you are accessing our website, the search word used (if our site is accessed via a search engine), as well as the type of connection and operating system. We use this information to constantly help improve your website experience. 

In general, you do not need to provide personalised information to access our websites. However, you might provide personal data to benefit from online communication services. Your personal data (e.g. your name, address, telephone number, email address, etc.) is stored only if you provide us with this information in order to use one of the services on our website (e.g. registering warranties/service, registering for a personalised web experience, signing up for the newsletter (e-mail only) or taking part in competitions). This data is then processed and used to perform the requested services. In addition, this data is only processed and used for other purposes (e.g. sending additional information about our company and products) if you have given us your advance consent to do so. Your consent is also required to transmit your personal data to third parties outside the legally permitted circumstances.

On some sites, we use a "double opt-in system". This means that when you first register with us, you are sent a confirmation email containing your login details. You then need to use these details to access our website. Your registration is not activated until you have logged in with your user name and password.

You have the right to receive a copy of your stored personal data at any time. In addition, you are entitled to withdraw your consent with future effect at any time. Please use the address provided under "Contacts" to do so.

Our websites and online communication services are not addressed to children and young people under the age of 14. Children and young people under the age of 14 may not transmit any personal data over the Internet without the consent of their parent or guardian. We ensure that we do not knowingly store any personal data relating to minors.

Some of our websites use cookies to track users' preferences and help us to structure the website optimally. Cookies are small files which are stored temporarily on your hard disk (session-based cookies). These cookies exist only until the end of the Internet session. They are used for navigation and increase the user friendliness of a website. You can still use some of our website even if you do not want cookies to be created on your computer. However, please note that some functions may be restricted and/or some websites will not be available. Most browsers accept cookies automatically. However, you can prevent this by setting your browser to block all cookies. For details, please refer to the instructions provided by your browser manufacturer.

Our websites contain links to other websites where you can find out more about other Toshiba Corporation products, other group companies or our partners. Please note that this data protection declaration does not apply to such linked websites. 

Toshiba has implemented technical and organizational security measures to guarantee the security of your personal information. Users' personal information is stored in our secure networks and access is restricted to those employees and partners who are entitled to access our systems.   
In areas where you enter data, we work with the "Secure Socket Layer" (SSL) standard encryption system. Please note that your browser must support encryption protection. You can find this SSL encryption, for example, in Internet Explorer version 3.0 or a higher version and most other browsers. Data is stored in databases which are protected against unauthorized access by security firewalls and software. Whenever your browser displays a closed padlock symbol at the bottom of the screen, or a similar icon/highlighted web address in a different browser, this indicates that your data is being transmitted in an encrypted format.   
If the SSL certificate is not available for technical reasons, an error page is displayed to ensure that under no circumstances your data is transmitted without encryption. 

No personal data collected via this website is processed outside the European Economic Area.

Toshiba reserves the right to add, delete, or modify any or all terms of the Data Protection Declaration at any time with or without notice.
