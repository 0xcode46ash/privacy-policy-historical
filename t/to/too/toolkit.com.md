This site is owned and operated by Wolters Kluwer. Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. We want to make your experience online satisfying and safe. By using this site, you agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Whenever you submit information via this site, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect how we gather and manage your information. All changes to this Privacy Policy are effective upon posting to this Web site without notice to you. You are responsible to view this Privacy Policy regularly.

Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.

### Gathered and Tracked Information 

We gather two types of information about users:

  * Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions or via purchases made in the Toolkit Store. These are voluntary submissions to become a Toolkit.com member, receive our electronic newsletters, to participate in our message boards or forums, to e-mail a friend, from participation in polls and surveys, and from making purchases in the Toolkit Store.
  * Information gathered through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to users' needs and to help us and our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience. As discussed below, we share certain aggregated data with our advertisers and sponsors. Because this site derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships and advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to users. 



### Membership Policy

We offer users the ability to register (for free) to become Toolkit.com members.   
Terms and conditions and other aspects of the membership are outlined at <http://www.toolkit.com/register.aspx>. In order to register, you are required to provide your e-mail address, a username, a password, and the state where you are located. We ask for additional optional information on you and your business, such as your name, contact information, and some characteristics of your business. You can also choose to subscribe to our free electronic newsletter

### Toolkit Store Policy

The Toolkit Store is an e-commerce platform allowing users to purchase products/services either directly via the Toolkit Store or by clicking through to a participating third party vendor's Web site to complete a purchase. Generally, in order to purchase products/services from the Toolkit Store, users will be required to provide personally identifiable information in order to complete the transaction and for us to fulfill the order. While the terms and conditions of different products/services may require users to provide different information, information routinely collected includes the user's name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and credit card information.

In cases where users purchase products/services in the Toolkit Store that are fulfilled by third parties, the user's personally identifiable information that is necessary for fulfillment of the order will be shared with that party in order to fulfill the order. The Toolkit Store will state when products/services are purchased directly via the Toolkit Store but are fulfilled by a third party. In cases where users link off to a third party's Web site in order to complete the purchase of products/services featured in the Toolkit Store, please be aware that we do not control the third party web sites and that this privacy policy does not apply to such third party sites. Users are advised to read the privacy policies and terms of use for such third party Web sites. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personally identifiable information. You should contact these third parties directly if you have any questions about their use of the information that they collect. We make no promises or guarantees regarding data collection or privacy practices on the Web sites that are not owned or operated by us.

We may disclose your personally identifiable information where required by applicable laws, court orders, or government regulations.

### Electronic Newsletters Policy 

We offer a free electronic newsletter to users that choose to subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription management page. Users can also subscribe to the newsletters at the time of registration to become a Toolkit.com member.

###  Message Boards/Forums Policy

Users of the site's Discussion Boards must register (free of charge) in order to post messages. During registration the user is required to supply a username, password, e-mail address and state.

### "E-mail This to a Friend" Policy

Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a friend". The user must provide his/her e-mail address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the e-mail. The information is not used for any other purpose.

### Polling

We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. The site may use a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users.

### Surveys

The site may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party.

### Protection of Personally Identifiable Information

Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, all personally identifiable information provided when users register for membership or purchase products/services in the Toolkit Store is encrypted with secure server software to protect it from unauthorized access. Your personally identifiable information, including your credit card information and username and password, will remain encrypted within our database. We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. For orders placed directly with Toolkit Media Group in the Toolkit Store, we reveal only the last four digits of your credit card number when confirming an order, although we do transmit the entire credit card number to our credit card processor during order processing.

We take reasonable steps to protect your personally identifiable information as you transmit your information from your computer to our site and to protect such information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. You should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever 100% secure or error-free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from this site may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail. Moreover, where you use passwords, ID numbers, or other special access features on this site, it is your responsibility to safeguard them.

### User Tracking

The site tracks user traffic patterns throughout the entire site; however, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. The site does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).

The site sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.

### Cookies

We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. This Web site uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). 

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site. However, you may need cookies to participate actively in message boards, forums, polling and surveys.

### Use of Information

The site uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the site or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.

As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out our electronic newsletter and to enable users to participate in polls, surveys, message boards, and forums. We send out newsletters to subscribers monthly, and may send out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing or that has happened. 

As stated above, we use tracking information to determine which areas of our site users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users, but this tracking is never associated with individual users and we don't track which search terms a particular user enters.

We create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked their ad. We will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.

### Sharing of the Information

We use the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your needs and help our advertisers, sponsors, and partners better understand our audience's demographics. This is essential to keeping our service free. We will not share information about individual users with any third party, except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.

### Consent

By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of this information. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.

### California Privacy Rights
