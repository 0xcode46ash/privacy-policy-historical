**1\. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**

**Anonymous Browsing**

You can visit this site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself, including your email address. In this case, our web server may collect the IP address you used to access the Internet and the website from which you came. This information is used by us and our business partners to measure the number of visits, average time spent, page views, and other statistics about visitors to our site in general. We may also use this data to monitor site performance, for systems administration purposes, to make this site easier and more convenient to use, and to report information in aggregate form to our advisers and other third parties (e.g. how many visitors log on to this site).

You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to prevent cookies from being sent. Please note, however, that by not accepting cookies, you will limit the functionality we can provide you when you visit our site. Tracking user preferences also helps us serve you targeted advertising. Targeted advertisements are probably more interesting for you and are more productive for our advertisers. Please note that we do not share your personal information with advertisers.

**Social Media (Features) and Widgets**

Our Website includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features are hosted by a third party and your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

**Personal Information Collection**

There are times when we may ask you for, or you may choose to provide, information about yourself and your business to assist us in meeting your various needs. This information may be used for the purpose of providing you with products or services you have requested, servicing your account, improving our services, developing and/or informing you of additional products or services provided by TOON BOOM, our affiliates or our business partners that may be of interest, or answering questions you may have. To provide these products or services, we may need to ask you directly to provide, among other things, your name, mailing address, postal code, email address, phone number, and date of birth. Also, you may elect to apply online for one of our products or services, which may require us and our subcontractors to gather additional information from our affiliates and third parties (including credit information) to determine your eligibility or to fulfill your order. At times, we also conduct online surveys to better understand the needs, profiles, and experience of our visitors. You will be given the option of not participating in such surveys. Once you provide us such information about yourself, your browsing on this site will no longer be anonymous to us.

**Analytics/Log Files**

We gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses and browser type.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movements around the site, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

We do link some of this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. This allows us to deliver a better experience by reducing the amount of data that needs to be entered when filling out forms, downloading gated content, completing surveys, etc.

**Children**

Access to this site is reserved to adults only, i.e. individuals who are considered major in the jurisdiction from which this site is accessed and no portion of this site is directed at children nor are they encouraged to visit this site.

Please note that we do not knowingly solicit information from children and we do not knowingly market our products and services to children.

**2\. COMMUNICATION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO AFFILIATES AND THIRD PARTIES**

When you provide information to us, we do not communicate or disclose your information to other third parties for the purpose of fulfilling and completing your requests and the transactions related thereto or for such third parties to offer you their products and services.

Occasionally, you may receive email communications with information from TOON BOOM, which may be useful to you, including information about our products and services or about offerings from TOON BOOM and our affiliates or third parties. We will include instructions in our email messages on how to unsubscribe if you later decide you do not want to receive any future emails or other marketing contacts.

We may also aggregate statistics that we gather about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and products and services, and provide these statistics to third parties; however, when we do, these statistics will not include any personal information that identifies individuals. All reasonable measures have also been taken so the information you provide to us will not be used by our affiliates or third parties for purposes other than those indicated herein.

We may also use, disclose, and communicate your personal information if required to do so by law, including by an order of any court or to any potential purchaser of an interest in our enterprise or of shares in our enterprise, as well as to any of our lenders or potential lenders.

**3\. HOW DO YOU ACCESS AND UPDATE YOUR INFORMATION?**

A copy of the personal information you provide to us and which we retain is kept on our servers or those of our service providers located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. You can access and notify us to update the personal information you have provided to us or request that we remove your name from our lists or not make your personal information available to third parties by sending us an email at info@toonboom.com. Also, you may request that we modify or delete information we have gathered during your visit by sending us an email at info@toonboom.com.

**4\. HOW IS YOUR INFORMATION SECURED AND PROTECTED?**

Where TOON BOOM considers it appropriate, TOON BOOM uses encryption and/or authentication tools, among other methods, to protect certain web-based personal information. Emails you send us are not necessarily secure when they are transmitted to us.

Certain sections of our Website allows you to order products and services for which you may be required to provide your credit card information. These sections use Transport Security Layer (TSL) protocol for browsers that support 256-bit encryption. TSL encrypts information as it travels between the customer and TOON BOOM so that your purchase information cannot be read as it travels over the Internet. You will know that your browser is secure by a change in the URL from "http://" to "https://". If the URL on a page asking you to provide information remains as "http://", beware as this may result in an unsecure transmission. If you are not using a browser which adheres to the TSL protocol and supports 256-bit encryption, the information you provide may not be secure and we recommend that you contact TOON BOOM by telephone to place your order.

When processing credit card purchases over the Internet, TOON BOOM or our third party service provider will verify your credit card information with the appropriate financial institution prior to processing your purchase. Neither we nor our third party service provider will supply your credit card information to any other third party.

We instruct our employees with access to your information that it is to be used only in adherence with the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy and the laws applicable to each specific business. Employees who misuse customer information may be subject to legal action by Toon Boom.

**5\. WHAT IF WE CHANGE OUR PRIVACY POLICY?**

TOON BOOM reserves the right to modify or supplement this Privacy Policy statement at any time. If we make any material change to this Privacy Policy, we will update this site to include such changes and post a notice on our home page with a link to the updated Privacy Policy. Please read any such notice and the new policy statement.

Your continued use of this site after we post such notice will constitute your acceptance of the new terms and their application to your use of this site and the information disclosed for such use, including information previously furnished to us, as if they were the initial terms. However, we will seek your consent if we want to use your personal information for purposes other than those you have agreed to previously.

This site may contain links to other sites, including those of our business partners, vendors and advertisers. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, please understand that we are not responsible for the content of the privacy practices employed by other sites. Please be sure to review the privacy policies of those sites.

From time to time, this site displays advertisements or information and links to third parties. These advertisements or links may contain cookies placed by those third parties. TOON BOOM is not responsible for how those advertisements, the websites to which they are linked, or how any other linked sites, may use their own cookies. For example, cookies received with banner ads may be collected by the company posting the ad on our site. Again, please refer to that company's privacy policy for further information.

From time to time, TOON BOOM may have access to the information gathered by those third party sites or advertisers. If that information identifies you personally, TOON BOOM intends to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

From time to time TOON BOOM may make online surveys available to users of the site. Participation in those surveys is voluntary. Some online surveys may ask participants for personal information, such as an email address, in addition to requesting answers to survey questions. TOON BOOM may use that personal information to contact the participant if necessary, or to send the participant information about TOON BOOM or other topics TOON BOOM thinks will interest the participant. TOON BOOM may make the results of any survey publicly available, although TOON BOOM will not attribute any particular response to you without your permission. Participants may opt out of receiving future informational mailings from TOON BOOM. See the _HOW DO YOU ACCESS AND UPDATE YOUR INFORMATION?_ above.

On occasion TOON BOOM may make available to users of the site contests in which they may qualify for participation. Participation is always voluntary and subject to the applicable contest rules. The contest may ask participants to provide personal information as a condition of participation. TOON BOOM may use that information to contact the participant with regard to the contest itself, or when otherwise necessary. TOON BOOM may also use that information to send participants information about TOON BOOM or other topics TOON BOOM thinks will interest the participant. Finally, TOON BOOM may make the names of contest winners public, as provided in the rules of such contests, or as required by applicable law. Participants may opt out of receiving future mailings from TOON BOOM. See the _HOW DO YOU ACCESS AND UPDATE YOUR INFORMATION?_ above. In some instances, the applicable contest rules may contain additional or different uses for the information you provide; please be sure to review those rules carefully before entering.
