This information is used by us and our business partners to measure the number of visits, average time spent, page views, and other statistics about visitors to this Site in general. We may also use this data to monitor site performance, for systems administration purposes, to make this Site easier and more convenient to use and to report information in aggregate form to our advisers and other third parties (e.g. how many visitors log in to this Site).

You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to prevent cookies from being sent. Please note, however, that by not accepting cookies, you will limit the functionality we can provide you when you visit this Site.

Tracking user preferences also helps us serve you targeted advertising. Targeted advertisements are probably more interesting for you and are more productive for our advertisers. Please note that we do not share your personal information with advertisers.

**Personal Information Collection**

This information may be used for the purpose of providing you with products or services you have requested, servicing your account, improving our services, developing and / or informing you of additional products or services provided by TOON BOOM, our affiliates or our business partners that may be of interest, or answering questions you may have. To provide these products or services, we may need to ask you directly to provide, among other things, your name, mailing address, postal code, e-mail address, phone number and date of birth. Also, you may elect to apply on-line for one of our products or services, which may require us and our subcontractors to gather additional information from our affiliates and third parties (including credit information) to determine your eligibility or to fulfill your order. At times, we also conduct on-line surveys to better understand the needs, profiles, and experience of our visitors. You will be given the option of not participating in such surveys. Once you provide us such information about yourself, your browsing on this Site will no longer be anonymous to us.

**2.COMMUNICATION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO AFFILIATES AND THIRD PARTIES**

When you provide information to us, we do not communicate or disclose your information to other third parties for the purpose of fulfilling and completing your requests and the transactions related thereto or for such third parties to offer you their products and services. The exception being any customers who purchase Animation-ish, a product jointly developed by Toon Boom Animation Inc. and FableVision Inc. In this case, the customer information will be shared by both Toon Boom and FableVision.

Occasionally, you may receive e-mail communications with information from TOON BOOM, which may be useful to you, including information about our products and services or about offerings from TOON BOOM and our affiliates or third parties. We will include instructions in our e-mail messages on how to unsubscribe if you later decide you do not want to receive any future e-mails or other marketing contacts.

**3.HOW DO YOU ACCESS AND UPDATE YOUR INFORMATION?**

A copy of the personal information you provide to us and which we retain is kept on our servers or those of our service providers located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

**4.HOW IS YOUR INFORMATION SECURED AND PROTECTED?**

Where TOON BOOM considers it appropriate, TOON BOOM uses encryption and/or authentication tools among other methods to protect certain web-based personal information. E-mails you send us are not necessarily secure when they are transmitted to us.

Certain sections of our Web sites allow you to order products and services for which you may be required to provide your credit card information. These sections use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Protocol for browsers that support 128-bit encryption (such as Netscape® Navigator version 2.0 or greater, or Microsoft® Internet Explorer version 2.1 or greater). SSL encrypts information as it travels between the customer and TOON BOOM so that your purchase information cannot be read as it travels over the Internet. You will know that your browser is secure by a change in the URL from http:// to https://. If the URL on a page asking you to provide information remains as http://, beware as this may result in an unsecure transmission. If you are not using a browser which adheres to the SSL Protocol and supports 128-bit encryption, the information you provide may not be secure and we recommend that you contact TOON BOOM by telephone to place your order.

When processing credit card purchases over the Internet, TOON BOOM or our third party service provider will verify your credit card information with the appropriate financial institution prior to processing your purchase. Neither we nor our third party service provider will supply your credit card information to any other third party.

We instruct our employees with access to your information that it is to be used only in adherence with the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy and the laws applicable to each specific business. Employees who misuse customer information may be subject to disciplinary action.

**5.WHAT IF WE CHANGE OUR PRIVACY POLICY?**

TOON BOOM reserves the right to modify or supplement this Privacy Policy statement at anytime. If we make any material change to this Privacy Policy, we will update this Site to include such changes and post a notice on our home page with a link to the updated Privacy Policy. Please read any such notice and the new policy statement.

Your continued use of this Site after we post such notice will constitute your acceptance of the new terms and their application to your use of this Site and the information disclosed for such use, including information previously furnished us, as if they were the initial terms. However, we will seek your consent if we want to use your personal information for purposes other than those you have agreed to previously.

**6.WEBSITE LINKS**

This Site may contain links to other sites, including those of our business partners, vendors and advertisers. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, please understand that we are not responsible for the content of the privacy practices employed by other sites. Please be sure to review the privacy policies of those sites.

From time to time, this Site displays advertisements or information and links to third parties. These advertisements or links may contain cookies placed by those third parties. TOON BOOM is not responsible for how those advertisements, the web sites to which they are linked, or how any other linked sites, may use their own cookies. For example, cookies received with banner ads may be collected by the company posting the ad on our Site. Again, please refer to that company's privacy policy for further information.
