## Electronically Produced Data

**Cookies**. TooShocking.com, like most standard website servers, may use cookies and other tools to collect information about how you use the Site. A cookie is a small, unique text file that a website can send to your computer hard drive when you visit a site. TooShocking.com may use "session cookies", which terminate when a user closes his or her browser, and/or "persistent cookies", which remain on the user's computer until manually deleted. Most web browsers can either alert you to the use of cookies or refuse to accept cookies entirely. If you do not want TooShocking.com to deploy cookies in your browser, you can set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when a website tries to put a cookie on your computer. Rejecting cookies may affect your ability to use the Site.

**Action Tags**. Like most standard website servers, TooShocking.com may employ a software technology called action tags (also known as "web beacons", "single pixel gifs", "clear gifs" or "web bugs"), which collect information and help to manage cookies, in order to gather information about Site usage. Action tags help TooShocking.com identify and track the performance of web pages on the Site, therefore allowing TooShocking.com to measure the performance and quality of the Site and to manage Site content. In addition, TooShocking.com may use action tags in emails. This allows TooShocking.com to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications by showing, for example, how many emails have been opened.

**IP Addresses**. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. Like most standard website servers, TooShocking.com collects IP addresses and other technical information about your machine through your web browser such as your operating system, browser type and referring URL for the purposes of, among other things, system administration and to ensure the validity of user requests.

**Log Files**. Like most standard website servers, TooShocking.com gathers certain information automatically and store it in log files, which contain information such as, among other things, IP addresses, browser type, operating system, ISP, date/time stamps and referring pages. Among other things, this information allows TooShocking.com to track statistics and trends on an aggregate basis.

  


## Maintenance of Information and Security

TooShocking.com maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of any personally identifiable information that you disclose to TooShocking.com. TooShocking.com utilizes what TooShocking.com believes to be industry standard security measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of personally identifiable information under TooShocking.com's control, and TooShocking.com limits access to your personally identifiable information within TooShocking.com to those employees who need to know the personally identifiable information to provide information, services and/or products to you. However, due to the nature of the Internet, computer networks, systems and other factors, no transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of TooShocking.com to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully, regardless of TooShocking.com's best intentions. As such, TooShocking.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to TooShocking.com, including without limitation personally identifiable information.

In the event TooShocking.com changes this Privacy Policy to allow disclosure of personally identifiable information to third parties, such adults will have the option to agree to the collection and use of such child and/or adult information without having to consent to the disclosure of such personally identifiable information to third parties.
