Privacy Policy  
     ToolBarn.com/ ToolpartsDirect.com values the relationship we have with our customers and we are committed to responsible information handling practices. Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. Because we gather certain types of information to process orders, we want you to understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it.   


Collection of Information (Personal Data & Aggregated Data)  
     ToolBarn.com gathers two types of information about users: 

  1. Personal data, provided through voluntary registration. 
  2. Aggregated data, which tracks users as a whole.

**Personal Data**  
We collect personal information such as your contact information (name, e-mail address), billing/shipping information (credit card number, shipping address). Credit card numbers are never stored on our system, nor do we have access to that data through our merchant account. When submitting personal information on an online form, we will identify which fields are required in order to fulfill your request. 

We request information when you purchase products or services, sign up for a drawing, promotion or survey, contact us with a question or concern or participate in other activities. In addition, when using our Web sites, our servers may collect click-stream information (such as the address (or URL) of the Web site that you came from before visiting our site, which pages you visit on our site, which browser you used to view our site and any search terms you have entered on our site. 

Your provision of such additional information is your acknowledgement that you consent to our use of such information to better serve you, our visitor, and others coming to our sites. Except as described below, it is not disclosed to parties in any way that personally identifies you without your prior permission. 

**Aggregated Data**  
Aggregated data, which tracks website user activity as a whole rather than on an individual basis, is gathered through several methods. This tracking data follows website traffic in general, and is not used to identify you personally. Aggregated tracking information helps us to determine which areas of our site users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what you read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We may disclose such aggregated information to third parties such as our vendors.   


Does ToolBarn share the information I've provided?  
     ToolBarn.com may need to share personal information with third parties in limited circumstances. For example, we may release personal information to third parties to perform services on our behalf such as; fulfilling our customer’s orders, sending marketing communications on our behalf, delivering packages, servicing products, conducting research or surveys, sending regular mail and e-mail, or processing credit card payments. ToolBarn.com does not sell or rent customer information to third parties. 

ToolBarn.com and ToolPartsDirect.com are affiliated entities and wholly owned subsidiaries of Tighton Fastener & Supply, Inc.

Contests and Drawings  
     ToolBarn occasionally offers contests and drawings in which we request certain personal information on a voluntary basis. These contests are conducted in full accordance with United States federal and state laws. The full rules and all information about such contests are clearly posted during the event, including how information gathered will be used.  


Does the ToolBarn website use cookies, other technologies, or third parties to indirectly collect information?

Our Web sites use cookies to simulate a continuous connection -cookies let us "remember" information about your session, such as what has been placed in your shopping cart, and allow you to move within areas of our Web sites without reintroducing yourself. No personally identifiable information is stored in these cookies. 

Our Web server automatically collects the address of the Web site that you came from before visiting our site, which browser you used to view our site and any search terms you have entered on our site. 

Our Web site may also use other technologies to track which pages on our Web sites our visitors view. This non-identifiable click-stream data helps us understand how visitors use our Web site and help to identify areas of improvement.   


Children and Privacy  
     We request that children under 17 do not submit or post any information to the site without parent’s or guardian's consent. We will not request or knowingly collect from a child any information online that can be traced to the child, such as an e-mail address, name, or information about the child's family.
