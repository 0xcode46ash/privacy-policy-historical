### Information Gathered

The Sites will gather information such as the type of browser and operating system that visitors are using, their IP address, cookie information, time stamp (the time each page is accessed as well as the amount of time spent per page) and clickstream information (for example, which pages are viewed and how long they have been there). Note that information is only gathered while the visitor is on the Sites. Dell Software Inc. monitors how a visitor arrives at the Sites. Dell Software Inc. automatically receives and records such information on our server logs from your browser.

When you engage in certain activities on the Sites, such as ordering products, downloading software, using certain services, obtaining technical support or entering contests, Dell Software Inc. may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, Dell Software Inc. may require that you provide us with personal information, such as your name, title, company, mailing, billing or shipping address, work e-mail address, work phone number and other personally identifiable information. When ordering products or services on the Sites, you may be asked to provide credit card information.

In certain sections of the Sites, Dell Software Inc. may invite you to contact us to pose questions, request information, or complete a registration form. We may ask for personal information to be entered as a means of registration before accessing these sections of the Sites.

### Use of Personally Identifiable Information

Personally identifiable information that you provide to Dell Software Inc. within the Sites may be used by Dell Software Inc. to provide you with the products, services and information that you requested or with offers or promotions that may interest you, service your accounts, and save you time and better respond to your needs. In addition, we may use your information to verify your authority to enter into certain areas of the Sites, improve the content and general administration of the Sites and our services, provide you with notices regarding our products and services, and, with permission, provide you with updates and information about our products and services.

When you submit personal information to Dell Software Inc., you understand and agree that Dell Software Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates may transfer, store, and process your information in any of the countries in which Dell Software Inc. and its affiliates maintain offices, including without limitation, the United States. Transfer, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information shall be in accordance with applicable laws. Dell Software Inc. complies with the U.S. – E.U. Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data from the European Union member countries.

Dell Software Inc., its affiliates and subsidiaries collect this information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select and to provide the products and services on the Sites. If you order a product, for example, the information is used to register your license and rights, if any, to technical support, upgrades, or other benefits that may be made available to registered customers. You agree that Dell Software Inc., its affiliates and subsidiaries can store and use your information for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Statement, including, if applicable, transferring your data to our third party payment processors. Dell Software Inc., its affiliates and subsidiaries use third party address verification software to verify the address provided is a correct mailing address. If you enter a contest, information is collected to qualify the entry and contact you regarding the contest or prize awards. Dell Software Inc., its affiliates and subsidiaries also use information that you provide as part of our effort to send you information about product upgrades, special offers, and other Dell Software Inc. products and services and its affiliates’ products and services that may interest you.

Dell Software Inc. recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of this information. If you do not want the information you provide to Dell Software Inc. to be used to inform you of other products and special offers, or if you wish to change or modify information previously provided, you can do so by following the procedures set forth in the Choice/Opt-Out or Correct/Update Section of this policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties unless we obtain your prior consent. We may, however, share your information with a distributor or partner in your area who can assist with your request for information if Dell Software Inc. does not have its own sales force in your area. The distributor or partner may use these details to contact you about the support services that they may offer as well as other Dell Software Inc. products or services that you may be interested in. If you do not want to receive information from our distributors or partners, you may opt out by following the procedures set forth in the Choice/Opt-Out or Correct/Update Section of this policy and contacting [listmaster@software.dell.com](mailto:listmaster@software.dell.com).

Only information requested or described will be disclosed as directed pursuant to the law, subpoena or court order. Subject to our legal obligations, Dell Software Inc. will notify customers of the information request as allowed by the law, subpoena or court order.

### Log Files

As is true of most web sites, the Sites gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Sites, to track users' movements around the Sites and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.

In addition, we use Third-Party Tracking Services that use tracking technologies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Sites in the aggregate to capture usage and volume statistics.

### Use of Cookies

When you visit the Sites, you can surf the Sites anonymously and access important information without revealing your identity. In order to improve our Sites, we use "cookies" to track your visit. A cookie is small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a Web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your identification card, recording your passwords, purchases, and preferences. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. (For some Web pages that require an authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept cookies will probably not be able to access those pages.)

While Dell Software Inc. uses cookies to track your visit to the Sites, this information does not identify you personally and you remain anonymous unless you have otherwise provided Dell Software Inc. with personally identifiable information.

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our Sites. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Statement covers the use of cookies by Dell Software Inc. only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third party. See the Third Party Tracking Services section of this Privacy Statement for additional information.

### Web Beacons (Clear Gifs/Web Bugs)

Some pages on the Sites may also use "Web beacon" technologies. When a visitor accesses pages on the Sites with a Web beacon, an anonymous notice of that visit is generated that may be processed by Dell Software Inc. or Dell Software Inc.'s vendors. These Web beacons work in conjunction with cookies to let us know what portions of our Sites are of interest to our visitors and to help us provide you with tailored information from our Sites.

If you turn off cookies, Web beacon technologies will still detect anonymous visits, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other anonymous information or personally identifiable information and are disregarded.

If you use a bulletin board, testimonial, chat room, and/or communities on the Sites, you should be aware that any information, including personally identifiable information, that you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. For testimonials, we obtain the customer's consent prior to posting their name along with their testimonial. We are not responsible for the information that you choose to submit in these forums. If you want to remove your personal information that is being displayed on our Sites under public pages, please contact us at [webmaster@software.dell.com](mailto:webmaster@software.dell.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

### Referral Service

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Sites, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Sites. Dell Software Inc. does not store this information.

### Jive Software

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our Sites, you can email us at [webmaster@software.dell.com](mailto:webmaster@software.dell.com).

### Links to Other Web Sites

The Sites may contain links to other web sites. Please be aware that this Privacy Statement applies solely to the information collected on the Sites and to no other web sites. Dell Software Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any other web sites. We encourage you to be aware when you are leaving the Sites and read the privacy statements of the site that you visit prior to providing any personal information.

### Changes to this Privacy Statement

As we continue to develop our Sites and take advantage of technologies to improve the services that we provide, this Privacy Statement may change. If this Privacy Statement does change, we will post the changes here. In addition, if we materially change any of our practices related to the collection and use of personally identifiable information, we will either notify users via e-mail or post a prominent notice on our Sites. After any change, we will also revise the "Page last updated" date at the bottom of the Privacy Statement. We therefore encourage you to refer to this Privacy Statement on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current Privacy Statement and how we are protecting the personal information we collect.
