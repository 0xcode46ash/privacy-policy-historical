This Website uses "cookies" to enable you to sign in to our services and to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a piece of text that is placed on your computer's hard drive. Depending on the settings you have selected, your browser adds the text to your device as a small file. You can change the browser settings as described below; many browsers are set to accept cookies by default. We use cookies to store your preferences and other information on your computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to enter the same information repeatedly.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Many web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of This Website and services that depend on cookies.

###  **Targeted Display Advertising by the Dell Software Portfolio and Others**

We also work with third party advertising and personalization partners that use cookies to help us display personalized content and appropriate advertising during your visits to This Website and other websites.

Similarly, third parties use cookies to deliver advertising for companies other than those within the Dell Software Portfolio to you on the Internet, whether you are on This Webstie or another website, based on your visits to This Website and other websites, and to measure the effectiveness of those advertising campaigns. These cookies assist the third parties in identifying the pages you view, the links and ads you click on, other actions you take on those web pages, and the site from which you came before arriving at a web page.

###  **“Do Not Track” Signals**

Please note that while you may have the opportunity to opt-out of targeted advertising through links on the advertisements themselves and you may be able to control the use of cookies through your web browser as described in the “How We Use Cookies” section above, some web browsers may give you the ability to enable a “do not track” setting that sends a special signal to the websites you encounter while web browsing. This is different from disabling certain forms of tracking by declining cookies in your browser settings, as browsers with the “do not track” setting enabled still have the ability to accept cookies.

A web beacon is an electronic image that can be used to recognize a cookie on your computer when you view a web page or email.
