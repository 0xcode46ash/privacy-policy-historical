This includes interactive features or materials and mobile applications that by their nature interact with The Sites and post this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy only covers the Sites and does not cover any information otherwise collected by us (such as, without limitation) in the "real world" [offline] or at any other web site whether or not owned by us. You may be asked to provide your personal information any time you are in contact with Tom Hess Music Corporation.

You may also choose to share additional personal information in public forums or on sign-up forms or certain pages within the Sites.

  * _Information We May Collect during Your Visit to The Sites or Mobile Applications_ : When you contact the Sites or mobile applications, the Tom Hess Music Corporation and its third party service providers may also collect your usage information. This usage information may be collected through automated or passive means and may include a variety of technologies that collect information whenever you come into contact with the Sites or mobile applications. For example, these technologies record and collect your browser information, the “click-through URL” that linked you to the Sites or mobile applications, your usage information about pages and/or features that you visited, the date and time of your contact, and other similar information. We may also collect your internet protocol (“IP”) address or other automatically assigned identifiers that allow us to identify the device or mechanism through which you contact the Sites or mobile applications. We treat device and mechanism identifiers, as well as your usage information, to be the type of personal information that may be collected from you at any time when you are in contact with the Sites or mobile applications. We may also use this personal information in order to remember you and your preferences. We do not link aggregate data with PII.  
 
  * _How We Collect Your Personal Information_ : During your visit to the Sites or mobile applications, we may use the following technologies, without limitation, to collect your personal information: (1) cookies; (2) Flash cookies; (3) small graphic images or web beacons; (4) embedded script; and (5) similar technologies. Cookies are data files placed on the device that is used to access a website. A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a device via a third party plug-in (which may be built into your device or downloaded to your device). Small graphic images or web beacons, other web programming code that may be invisible to you, may be included on the Sites, mobile applications, and in Tom Hess Music Corporation e-mail messages. Web beacons may be used to count the number of users accessing the Sites and mobile applications, monitor how users navigate our websites and mobile applications, and count the number of e-mails that were sent and actually opened or the number of particular articles or links that were actually viewed. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Sites or mobile applications (e.g., a link that you click on). We utilize both Session and persistent cookies. A session cookie is a code temporarily “dropped” in your browser through which you access the Sites and mobile applications from our web server or a third party service provider, and is only active while you are in contact with the Sites. This code is deactivated or deleted thereafter. A persistent cookie remains after the session is terminated. We use information collected to: (1) allow for better site functionality while you are visiting the Sites; (2) provide you with information about services and products that we think may be of interest to you; and (3) to collect aggregate (non-personalized) data. Most browsers allow you to “turn-off” cookies. You should consult with your individual browser provider. However, if you turn off cookies, you may not be able to enjoy complete site functionality.



a. We may, from time to time, supplement the information that we collect about you online with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, as well as offer opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We will apply this Privacy Policy to all collected personal information and may combine your collected personal information to serve our needs in any way, unless we have disclosed otherwise.

b. If you send a third party a communication from the Sites or mobile applications, such as sending a friend a news article or information about a job opening, we may use this information on a one-time basis to facilitate the communication. We will not use it for any other marketing purpose, unless we obtain consent from that third party.

**How We Use Your Personal Information**

  * We may use the information that we collect about you to accomplish any of the following: (1) provide you with information, services, or process transactions that you have requested or agreed to receive, including sending electronic newsletters, or providing you with special offers or promotional materials on behalf of the Tom Hess Music Corporation or third parties; (2) enable you to participate in a variety of the features on the Sites and mobile applications, such as online entry sweepstakes and message boards; (3) process your registration with the Sites and mobile applications, including verifying that your e-mail address is active and valid; (4) improve and customize your experience when you contact the Sites and mobile applications; (5) contact you regarding your use of the Sites and mobile applications and, in our discretion, changes to the Sites and mobile applications or the policies that apply to both; (6) comply with court orders, valid subpoenas, and/or other applicable laws and regulations; (7) for our business purposes; and (8) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.

Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.  
 
  * _Business Transfer_ : We may share your personal information with our subsidiaries and affiliates for internal purposes.
