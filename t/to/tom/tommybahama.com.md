**How We Use Email**   
When you provide us your email address, we may send you emails necessary to process your order, respond to a request, provide customer service, or promote products or services. For example, after you place an order at TommyBahama.com, you will receive an email confirmation and, in most cases, an email with package tracking information.

**Information We Share with Others and Your Privacy Rights**   
If you shop at one of our affiliated businesses, including without limitation, Tommy Bahama, Indigo Palms and Tommy Bahama Relax stores, we may share information about you with that affiliate to improve your shopping experience. Each of our affiliates has a privacy policy that is consistent with our own. 

We also contract with service providers to maintain and manage our customer information, including credit card processing, shipping, name and address verification, email distribution, market research and promotions management. We provide these companies with only the information they need to perform their services and work closely with them to ensure that your privacy is respected and protected. These companies are prohibited by contract from using this information for their own marketing purposes or from sharing this information with anyone other than Tommy Bahama. We do not authorize any of these service providers to make any other use of your information. In addition, when we partner with another company to offer or provide products, services, contests or promotions, we may compare our customer list with theirs to identify our common customers. Tommy Bahama, its affiliates and its marketing partners may use that information to fulfill our respective obligations to you and for future promotional activities. 

When we offer contests and promotions, with or without a marketing partner, you may be required to provide certain personal information in order to participate. In these cases, we will give you the choice not to receive promotional email messages or other communications from us regarding our products, services, contests, and promotions. In this case, however, Tommy Bahama, or one of its affiliates may still need to contact you, for example, to notify winners and to fulfill promotional obligations. In the unlikely event of a sale of some or all of our business, Tommy Bahama will disclose your personal information to a purchaser that agrees to abide by the terms and conditions of this privacy policy. 

Tommy Bahama reserves the right to disclose information about you as required by law, in response to legal process and law enforcement requests, and as necessary to protect the property, interests and rights of Tommy Bahama, its affiliates, and others.

**Cookies and Pixel Tags**   
A cookie is a small data file that websites often store on your computer's hard drive when you visit their sites. A cookie may contain information, such as a unique user ID that websites use to track the pages you've visited on their site. 

We use cookies but do not store personally identifiable information in your cookie. We use cookies in order to improve your shopping experience. For example, we use cookies to: 

  * Remember what items are in your Shopping Bag
  * Recognize you when you return to our website
  * Enable you to use Express Checkout, if you have created an account at TommyBahama.com
  * Study how our Guest's navigate through our website and which products they request in site searches

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you set your browser to refuse cookies we cannot process your order on our website and will not recognize you as a registered user, which allows you to access your account information.

**Security**   
Protecting your personal information is important to us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect your online order information as it is transmitted over the Internet. 

Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use to process orders at TommyBahama.com. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower right-hand corner (IE and firefox) of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active. You can also double-check by looking at the "Address" line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https." 

If your browser or firewall doesn't support SSL, you will not be able to connect to the server, which means you won't be able to mistakenly place an order through an unsecured connection. If your browser does not support SSL, you may get an upgrade from the browser manufacturer's website. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, please call 1.866.986.8282 to place an order. 

Identity thieves sometimes send fraudulent email messages to trick customers into divulging personal or financial information (a practice known as "phishing"). Many of these emails feature company logos and language. Some of these emails even go as far as showing exact copies of company website pages. These emails and websites attempt to trick people into providing personal information such as: log-on IDs, passwords, credit card numbers, bank account information, Social Security Numbers, and other sensitive information. TOMMY BAHAMA DOES NOT REQUEST PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM CUSTOMERS VIA EMAIL. PLEASE NOTE THAT EMAIL IS NOT ENCRYPTED AND IS NOT CONSIDERED A SECURE MEANS OF TRANSMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION. If you have received or entered personal information in response to a suspicious email, pop-up or phony website claiming to be affiliated with Tommy Bahama or its affiliates, please call us at 1.866.986.8282 immediately.

For the best online experience, we strongly encourage you to review these policies at any site you visit.
