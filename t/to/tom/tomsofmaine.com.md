## Privacy Policy

At Tom's of Maine, we respect your privacy. Whether you request a catalog, place an on-line order, or e-mail us, your personal information is never shared with other companies or used in ways that violate your trust.

**How we use information**  
When you place an order or request a catalog, we ask for personal information that is necessary to process your request - such as name, address, and telephone number (in case there are questions about your order). You may choose whether or not you would like us to save this information for future visits. To maximize security, we do not save your credit card information on-line. We use e-mail to communicate valuable offers and information about our products and non-profits partnerships.

**Our use of "cookies"**  
Cookies are bits of information stored on your computer that enable us to customize your shopping experience and identify you when you return. Cookies can be disabled, but please keep in mind that if you do so, information will need to be re-entered the next time you place an order.

To help us better serve your needs, we may gather information about the usage of our website (e.g., pages viewed most frequently, number of visitors). This allows us to see where your interests are and determine ways we might make your on-line experience more enjoyable.

**Security**  
  


Our online shopping experience is a secure one. We use Public Key Encryption with digital certificate authentication. All personal information, including credit card information, is processed using the 128-bit SSL encryption protocol.
