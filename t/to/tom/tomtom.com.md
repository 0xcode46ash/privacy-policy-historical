# Privacy Policy - Legal - TomTom

This Policy was last updated in December 2009. 

**Scope**

TomTom International B.V. and its parent company, subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively " **TomTom** ", " **us** ", or " **we** ") appreciate the interest you ("You" or "Your") have shown in our products and services by visiting our websites, 

_[www.tomtom.com](http://www.tomtom.com/)_

or related communication channels such as TomTom HOME, TomTom WORK and TomTom's route planner and route widget (collectively, the " **Websites** "). This Privacy Policy outlines our guidelines for the information TomTom collects when You interact with TomTom, such as when You visit our Websites, when You use the products and services offered by TomTom, like TomTom HOME or our TomTom LIVE services, when You subscribe to our newsletter or when You call our Customer Support. 

" **Personal Information** " is information about You that is personally identifiable to You like Your name, address, e-mail address, or phone number. 

" **Anonymous Information** " means information that is not associated with or linked to Your Personal Information.  Anonymous Information does not permit identification of You.  Anonymous Information, such as basic usage statistics regarding Your use of the products and services offered by TomTom, does not by itself identify You to TomTom, though such information may be unique or consist of or contain information that You consider personal.   
In accessing the Websites You accept all the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. You also agree that TomTom may amend and/or revise this Privacy Policy at its discretion, and You agree to be bound by these revisions and amendments. Your Personal Information may be processed in the country where it was collected as well as in other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in Your country.   
If You do not agree with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy we request that You immediately cease using and accessing the Websites as well as the products and services for which You need to provide Personal Information.

**Information Collected Via Technology**

As You navigate our Websites, certain Anonymous Information may also be collected passively, including Your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system. We also use Cookies and data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of Your visit and the information for which You searched and viewed. We use this Anonymous Information to measure the traffic on our Websites and to help us make our Websites more useful. We delete this information after a period of time.   
TomTom may gather Anonymous Information from Your TomTom device when You are using it or when You are connecting it to a computer by using TomTom HOME. This Anonymous Information includes location information (information about Your location), information on how long it took You to travel certain routes, traffic patterns and on any technical glitches You may have encountered. The nature of the Anonymous Information that Your TomTom device transmits to us will not enable us to trace it back to an identifiable person; provided, however, You may elect to permit us to associate such Anonymous Information with Personal Information we have collected from You to provide You with specific location-based services that are tailored to meet Your needs or interests, to improve our products and services or to enforce the agreements, terms and conditions related to our Websites, products and services.

Please note that if You access our Websites from a shared computer or a public computer, such as one in an internet café, certain information about You, such as Your user account, may be visible to other individuals who use the computer after You.
