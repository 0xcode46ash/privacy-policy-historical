## Privacy Policy for Tombraiders.net

This document was last updated on 2/23/10.

##### General

Tombraiders.net respects your right to privacy. The following outlines the privacy policy for this site, as well as for its sister sites, [SpaceColonyFans.net](http://www.spacecolonyfans.net/) and [BrickRaiders.net](http://brickraiders.net/). If you have any questions, please feel free to email ([stellalune@tombraiders.net](mailto:stellalune@tombraiders.net)) or contact me through my [web form](http://tombraiders.net/stella/contact.html).

##### Personal Email & Opt-In Blog Notifications

There are no password-restricted areas on my sites and, unless you contact me, I have no way of obtaining your email address or other personal information.

When you sign up for my [blog feed](http://stellalune.blogspot.com/) or send me a message by email or through my [contact form](https://web.archive.org/web/20100611211224id_/http%3A//tombraiders.net/stella/contact.html), I do save your name (if you have provided it) and email address. **I _never_ , under any circumstances, rent, sell or share this information with any outside parties.** Subscribing to my feed or sending me a personal message will not cause you to receive any "spam"/junk email.

The only exception to this rule is in the case of contests, when I may have to share the winners' information with the company providing or shipping the prizes.

If you have subscribed to blog updates and would like to unsubscribe, please do so through the feed provider (e.g., FeedBurner, Google Friend Connect, etc.) or send me a request by email and you will be removed from the list immediately.

##### Log Files & Statistics

When you visit tombraiders.net, spacecolonyfans.net or brickraiders.net, our web server records information about your visit, including your IP (Internet Protocol) address, web browser type, operating system and the last page you visited before tombraiders.net. This site also uses [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) to track visitor statistics. This information is recorded in log files and used to analyze trends (e.g., which search engines and keywords were used to find this site, which pages are most popular, etc.), administer the site (e.g., find broken links), track users' movement through the site, and gather broad demographic information (e.g., users' country of origin). None of this information is linked to personally identifiable information or shared with any outside parties.

##### Advertising & Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data (in the form of a small text file) stored on a computer user's hard drive and containing information about the user. Cookies are used to personalize the information delivered to your web browser when you visit a particular web site. For example, some sites ask you to log in then use cookies to "recognize" you on subsequent visits. Some sites track your browsing preferences so they can display advertising that matches your interests, etc.

For more general information about cookies and how they work, please visit [Cookie Central](http://www.cookiecentral.com/faq/). 

My sites do not use cookies. However, the advertisements displayed on my pages do use cookies to track which ads a user clicks and to identify tombraiders.net, spacecolonyfans.net or brickraiders.net as the site responsible for "click-throughs" to an advertiser's site. I do not have access to or control over the cookies delivered when an ad is displayed or when a user visits an advertiser's site. Users are welcome to browse my sites with cookies disabled or to reject specific cookies if they choose. Check your web browser's help files for information on changing your privacy/cookie settings.

Please note that all of these companies represent numerous individual advertisers. If you have questions about specific advertisers' policies, please visit their individual sites.

If you are a webmaster interested in joining any of these programs, feel free to contact me for more information.

##### Links

I am not responsible for the content, security or privacy practices of these sites.
