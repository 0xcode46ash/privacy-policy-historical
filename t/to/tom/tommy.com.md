### Respecting your privacy

PVH Brands Australia is committed to handling your personal information/ data in an open and transparent way.

This Privacy Policy applies to PVH Brands Australia Limited (ACN 165 485 290) and its related bodies corporate (collectively referred to as “PVH Brands Australia”, “we”, “our” and “us” and severally referred to as a “PVH Brands Australia entity”).

PVH Brands Australia is bound by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and Privacy Act 1993 (NZ). We will only collect and use personal information in accordance with our legal obligations and this Policy. ‘Personal information’ means information which identifies you as an individual or from which you can reasonably be identified.

PVH Brands Australia may also be subject to the requirements of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR), as it may (from time to time) collect personal data of EU residents or offer goods and services to individuals in the EU. As part of our Privacy compliance framework we have appointed a ‘data protection officer’ to monitor and advise on compliance with the GDPR and with internal privacy policies and procedures, and their contact details can be found in this Policy.

This Policy outlines our personal information management practices. It relates to the personal information that we collect from customers, suppliers, employees, contractors, visitors to our website, any apps we may use, social media and any other digital services or collection methods that we may employ. By providing your personal information to PVH Brands Australia, you consent to and acknowledge our personal information handling practices as outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless you tell us to the contrary by contacting our Privacy Contact Officer/ Data Protection Officer.

There may be additional privacy notices and terms that are relevant to you depending on the nature of your dealings with us (e.g. use of our online sites, membership of loyalty programs, entry into competitions etc).

Where we can, we will allow you to deal with us anonymously or by using a pseudonym. However, in some circumstances, this may not allow us to be able to provide you with a service (such as deliveries etc). We will inform you if it is possible for an interaction to occur on an anonymous basis and, where it is, it will be optional for you to provide personal information.  
If you have any questions regarding PVH Brands Australia’s Privacy Policy, please call our Privacy Officer/ Data Protection Officer in Australia on 02 93162800 or email us at [privacy@pvhbrandsaustralia.com.au](mailto:privacy@pvhbrandsaustralia.com.au). If you would like PVH Brands Australia to send you a copy of this policy, please contact us and we will do so.

In our store, depending on whether you are a consumer or small business, we collect your company name, personal name, address and other relevant personal details if this is needed to comply by local fiscal and legal requirements such as to provide a tax receipt.

**Third Party Websites**

If you provide your personal information to a third party via a link from the PVH Brands Australia website (such as when you enter a competition or register for another type of promotion), that information is collected and managed by those third parties.

We may collect personal information from our business or related entities and affiliates which collected your information in a different country.

We may also collect information about you by accessing data from other sources and then analysing that data with the information that we already hold about you in order to learn more about your preferences and interests.

If we receive information about you from a third party and it is not information we need in respect of our business activities, we will destroy or de-identify that information (provided it is lawful to do so).

Some techniques for delivering content based on your interests are referred to as online behavioural advertising.

If you do not wish to be contacted by PVH Brands Australia, please call our Privacy Officer/ Data Protection Officer in Australia on 02 93162800 or email us at [privacy@pvhbrandsaustralia.com.au](https://web.archive.org/web/20181216072701id_/http://www.pvhbrandsaustralia.com.au/privacy-policy/privacy@pvhbrandsaustralia.com.au%20). If you would like PVH Brands Australia to send you a copy of this policy, please contact us and we will do so.

### Does PVH Brands Australia disclose your personal information to overseas recipients?

In some circumstances, PVH Brands Australia may disclose your personal information to overseas recipients.  If this occurs, we take steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that the overseas recipient does not breach the relevant privacy laws in relation to that information.

Your personal information may be disclosed to other PVH Brands Australia entities, business partners and service providers in Australia and overseas.

Our service providers are mainly located in Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America. However, from time to time we may need to engage a service provider in another country. We may also be required to report to regulatory authorities, within or outside of Australia, as required by law.

Your personal information may be stored in a secure and/or encrypted form overseas (e.g. in data storage and cloud computing facilities operated by us or by third parties on PVH Brands Australia’s behalf). By providing us with your personal information, you are agreeing to the disclosure of your personal information to third parties operating outside of Australia.  PVH Brands Australia will take all reasonable steps to ensure that any personal information we disclose overseas is handled in accordance with the law.

Sometimes we make the business decision to use third party platforms and services to process sales, provide web support, send marketing messages, deliver products or otherwise provide data storage and processing services.  These services are hosted and managed by organisations other than ourselves, and some of these services are hosted overseas.  These services may also involve geographic locations which change from time to time which include data protection and processing efficiency.  Where these services are used by us, it may not be practicable for us to notify you of which country your personal information may be located in.

### Use of Government Identifiers

PVH Brands Australia will not use Government Identifiers, such as Medicare numbers, or a driver’s licence number as its own identifier of individuals.

### Information security and website usage

We hold personal information electronically and in hard copy form, both at our own premises in Austraila and with the assistance of our service providers.  We have a number of security controls in place and we take

all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is stored securely and is protected from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

Our computer systems may be operated by us or by our service providers.  In all cases, we have rigorous information security requirements aimed at eliminating risks of unauthorised access to, and loss, misuse or wrongful alteration of, the personal information that we handle.  Examples of these measures include:

  * control of access to personal information through access and identity management systems (such as passwords); and
  * PVH Brands Australia personnel are bound by and trained on internal information security policies and are required to keep personal information secure at all times.



PVH Brands Australia also has policies in place for data retention across all key areas.  We keep your personal information for as long as it is required to provide you with the products you requested from us and to comply with legal requirements.  If we no longer require your personal information for any purpose, including legal purposes, we will take reasonable steps to securely destroy or de-identify your personal information.

Our websites are professionally hosted and operate in a secure environment.  You should however be aware that there is always an inherent risk in transmitting your personal information via the Internet.

If you have provided us with personal information (e.g. through a registration or a request for certain materials), we may associate this personal information with information gathered through cookies. This allows us to offer increased personalisation and functionality.

In all cases in which cookies are used, the cookie will not collect personal information except with your explicit permission. Your web browser can be set to allow you to control whether you will accept cookies, reject cookies or to notify you each time a cookie is sent to your browser. If your browser is set to reject cookies, websites that are cookie-enabled will not recognise you when you return to the website, and some website functionality may be lost. The Help section of your browser may tell you how to precent your browser from accepting cookies.

### How you can access or correct your personal information

You can request access to the personal information we hold about you at any time, and we will

provide you with that information unless we are prevented by law from giving it to you.  If we are unable to give you access to the information you have requested, we will give you reasons for this decision when we respond to your request.

You will not be charged for accessing your information, although we might have to charge the reasonable cost of processing your request, including photocopying, administration and postage.  We will advise you of any fee payable before we process your request.
