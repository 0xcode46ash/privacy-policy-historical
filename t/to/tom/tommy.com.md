A "cookie" is a small line of te t that is stored within your browser when you visit a cookie-enabled website. As you browse the Web, cookie-enabled sites will send cookies to your browser, along with pages. Your browser probably has options that will let you control whether the browser accepts cookies, rejects cookies, or notifies you each time a cookie is sent to you.

We use cookies on the Site for a number of reasons. First, cookies can help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Second, cookies allow us to better understand how users use the Site, which in turn helps us focus our resources on features that are most popular with our users. 

If your browser is set to reject cookies, cookie-enabled websites will not recognize you when you return. This provides you with anonymity, but it also makes it very difficult to offer you customized services. It is also less secure than using cookies, because all of your specific data must be sent to the website each time you view a page. Accepting cookies means your private data can stay at the Web server, and the only information transmitted over the Internet is your ID cookie.

If your browser is set to accept cookies, any cookies that are sent to your browser are stored in your computer for a period of time. There are a few different types of cookies. A "session" cookie is stored only in your computer's working memory (RAM) and only lasts for your browsing session. When you close all of your browser's windows, or when you shut down your computer, the session cookie disappears forever. A "permanent" cookie is stored on your computer's hard drive until a specified date, which could be tomorrow, ne t week, or 10 years from now. Permanent cookies stay on your computer until either

a) they e pire,  
b) they are overwritten with newer cookies,  
c) you manually remove them.

  
We make every effort to adhere to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), including its guidelines on Internet advertising. All tommy.com marketing efforts, including the Site, are closely scrutinized to conform to these guidelines. We encourage parents to supervise and join their children in e ploring cyberspace and to help us protect their privacy by instructing them not to provide personal information over the Internet without parental permission. Parents should additionally be aware of a growing variety of software capable of filtering online information to reflect their own choices and guidelines. This Site is not directed at children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a user is under the age of 13 and has provided personally identifiable information without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove such personally identifiable information from our records.
