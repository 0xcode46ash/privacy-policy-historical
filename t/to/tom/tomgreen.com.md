**PRIVACY POLICY**

Thank you for visiting TomGreen.com. Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

The Information We Collect

At TomGreen.com, you can create your own artist site, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these pages include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services. You may also be asked to submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card or e-mail reminder. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number. When you visit many of our Web pages, we also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows 95 or Mac OS), and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).

How We Use the Information

IP Address:

We use your IP address to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin.

Cookies:

Cookies are text files placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences when you surf the Web. Cookies, by themselves, do not give your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information by, for example, registering to the site. Once you register, you don't have to reenter your information each time you enter our site.

Cookies may also be used by our ad servers for the purpose of: calculating the number of unique users (a key advertising metric), performing frequency caps (preventing a user from seeing the same ad more than a specified number of times), and for the geographic targeting of ads. The cookies that come from these ad servers do not track any identifying personal information. When a user scrolls over an ad on TomGreen.com, the name of the ad server appears in the "mouse-over." This does not necessarily indicate that such company is collecting data on the user, merely that the company's computers served the ad.

Personal Information:

Through surveys and newsletter registration, our site may request users to give us contact, demographic, and/or financial information (such as name, locale, gender, age, income level and e-mail address). We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services we believe may be of interest to you. We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services. This demographic information is also used for advertising and marketing purposes. We use the information gathered during newsletter registration to notify users of updates made to the content of their choosing.

We hold contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (such as their name and e-mail address) and demographic information (such as their ZIP code and age). The user's contact information is sometimes used to contact the user when necessary, such as to notify them if they win a contest or to notify users of upcoming contests. There are three primary types of contests: (1) We host solely and all information that is collected stays in-house. (2) We may share address information with third party for shipping purposes. (3) In some rare instances, a third party may host the contest and all information is then shared. By virtue of their sponsorship, this third party may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion. TomGreen.com has no control over the third-party sponsors' use of this information. TomGreen.com will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if third-party sponsors will obtain such information.

The information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, or services.

We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request.

Agents and contractors of TomGreen.com who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for TomGreen.com.

Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosure of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking the site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data.

If TomGreen.com discloses personally identifiable information to companies not owned by TomGreen.com who want to market products or services to you, we will provide you with an opportunity to opt out or block such uses.

TomGreen.com may on occasion combine information we receive online with outside records to enhance our ability to market to you those products or services that may be of interest to you.

Finally, TomGreen.com sites will not use or transfer personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated to those described above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt out of these unrelated uses.

Third-Party Sites and Sponsors

The Service may contain links, through advertising or otherwise, to other Web sites ("Linked Sites"). The Linked Sites are not under the control of TomGreen.com and TomGreen.com is not responsible or liable for the communications or materials of any Linked Sites. TomGreen.com is providing these links to you as a convenience and to advertisers to promote their own sites or products, and the inclusion of any link does not imply TomGreen.com's endorsement of the site or any association with its operators. You are responsible for adhering to the applicable Terms of Use for any other Web site. You are strongly encouraged to evaluate any third party sites, as you are solely responsible and liable for any interactions you may have with such sites, their sponsors and other third-parties. We also take no responsibility for how a third-party sponsor utilizes the user information it collects.

Bulletin Boards and/or User Reviews

This site contains message boards and/or user-posted reviews available to its users. We request users to give us contact information, such as name, e-mail, address, occupation, and interest to become a registered user. This information may be used by the administrator to send the user e-mail notices. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information, and users should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information.

Our Commitment to Security

We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.
