## The details

## 1\. Introduction

**1.1** TotallyMoney is a credit broker, not a lender. We offer a range of free services that aim to help you better understand your credit situation. You can use our services to get your free credit report and score, and to see what that information means in practical terms for you, and for your borrowing power. We will show you whether you are likely to be accepted for specific products, including credit cards and loans. In order to provide this level of personalised information, it is necessary for us to disclose and receive data about you. If you want to apply for a product you find using our services, we will pass you through to the relevant lender.

**1.2** You need to register with us to access the full range of services.

**1.3** The details of how we will use your data are set out below in this privacy notice. You should also read our [Terms and Conditions](http://www.totallymoney.com/info/terms/) and [Cookies Policy](http://www.totallymoney.com/info/cookie-policy/) carefully before you decide to use our services.

## 2\. About TotallyMoney

**2.1** The website www.totallymoney.com (“ **Site** ”) and the TotallyMoney App (“ **App** ”) are owned and operated by TotallyMoney Limited trading as TotallyMoney (“ **we** ”, “ **us** ” or “ **our** ”).

**2.2** We are an appointed representative of MI Money Limited which is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority in respect of consumer credit related activities including credit broking and the provision of credit information services (FCA FRN 511936).

**2.3** Data protection law applies to our collection and use of personal information and TotallyMoney Limited is the controller for that personal information (ICO Registration Number Z1096594) of Churchill House, 142-146 Old Street, London, EC1V 9BW — details of our registration can be found online at [the ICO website](https://ico.org.uk/).

## 3\. Where we collect personal information from

In order to provide our Services to you, we collect information about you from five main sources, as more fully described below:

(a) from you when you register;

(b) from the credit reference agencies (" **CRAs** ") we use (for example to provide credit report and score data);

(c) from our third party service providers and the Lenders we work with to receive eligibility data and limited data about the outcome of Product applications you make as a result of using our Services;

(d) information about your visit, such as our analysis of how you behave on our Site; and

(e) from our sister company, MI Money Limited, when you agree to receive marketing from us when you apply for a Product that MI Money Limited promotes (including the Fluid and Granite credit cards).

## 4\. About our services

**For customers of the Intelligent Alerts Service: Please note that we have now closed the Intelligent Alerts Service to new customers, and the service to existing customers will end in November 2018. Existing customers should refer to Paragraph 5.3 of these terms and conditions for further details.**

**4.1** We have two sets of services available through our Site: those you need to register for, and those you do not. If you register with us, you will create an account with TotallyMoney (“ **TotallyMoney Account** ”) that will give you access to our “ **Account Services** ” — that is, access to a free credit report and credit score service (“ **Credit Report Service** ”), plus tailored information about your borrowing power and eligibility for Products (“ **Borrowing Power Service** ”). If you do not wish to register with us, you can still access our “ **Eligibility Check Service** ”, which allows you to check your eligibility for and compare Products on a one-off basis.

**4.2** In this privacy notice when we refer to “ **Services** ” we are referring to the Account Services, the Intelligent Alerts, Eligibility Check Service. When we refer to “ **Product(s)** ” we are referring to credit cards, loans, mortgages and such other financial products provided by third parties for consumers that we feature on our Site / App or may introduce in the future.

**4.3** Personalisation is an important part of our Services. We will analyse and profile your personal information in order to tailor the information that we present to you, to improve our Services, and to determine the offers and communications that might be of interest to you (where applicable). To do this, we use automated technology that assesses your personal information to create a profile of you (including your credit eligibility) and search for and recommend suitable Products for you. This is a type of automated decision making and, depending on how you use the information provided, may have a significant effect on you as it relates to your credit, including your eligibility for credit and credit applications. Whilst we do not make credit decisions about you, we do this automated decision making because it is necessary for us to provide the Services to you and our legal basis for processing is contractual necessity. If you wish to object to this automated decision making and profiling, we will not be able to provide the Services to you and will close your account. 

**4.4** Across our Services, you will have the opportunity to apply for Products directly from Lenders. In you elect to apply, we may provide your information to the Lender as set out in the Service sections below. Note that if you go on to apply for a Product as a result of using our Service, the Lender will perform credit reference and fraud prevention agency checks as part of the application process.

## 5\. How we store and use your personal information

### 5.1 Legal bases

We consider that the legal bases for using your personal information as set out in this privacy notice are as follows:

(a) **Contract performance:** if we agree directly with you to provide you with our Services, we will use your personal information to the extent necessary in order to provide those Services; or

(b) **Legal and regulatory obligations:** our use of your personal information is necessary for complying with our legal or regulatory obligations (for example, complying with our regulatory obligations to the Financial Conduct Authority, or addressing enquiries or complaints from you or a regulator); or

(c) **Legitimate interests:** where neither (a) nor (b) apply, use of your personal information is necessary for our legitimate interests (including our commercial interests) or the legitimate interests of others (for example,: to ensure and monitor the security of our Site; , occasionally we may use personal information when to developing or testing new features of our Site; to promote our free Services to you and other people or, if you have not opted out, to provide you with details of products and services that may interest you).

If we rely on our (or another person's) legitimate interests for using your personal information, we will undertake a balancing test to ensure that our (or the other person's) legitimate interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of the personal information; or

(d) **Consent:** in certain cases, we will rely on consent to process your personal information for marketing purposes (for instance, where you give opt-in consent to a third party such as our sister company, MI Money Limited, to receive email marketing from us).

If we rely on consent to use your personal information in a particular way, but you later change your mind, you may withdraw your consent by contacting us at help@totallymoney and we will stop doing so.

Further details about the legal bases for processing in relation to each of our Services and other activities is set out below.

### 5.2 Eligibility Check Service

We make the Eligibility Check Service available to let you run a one-time comparison of Products and check your eligibility to apply for them. This will give you an understanding of the likelihood of your application for a Product being accepted at the time you use the Eligibility Check. We use your personal information to provide the Eligibility Check Service as further described below.

(a) We design our registration forms to collect only the information we need in order to provide the Services to you, and so we may update the required fields from time to time accordingly. Our current registration process requires that you provide us with the following personal information:

(ii) date of birth;

(iii) email address;

(iv) employment status;

(v) annual income;

(vi) monthly expenses;

(vii) loan purpose (loans only);

(viii) phone number (loans only);

(ix) whether immediate cash advance required (credit cards only);

(x) address;

(xi) time at address; and

(xii) residential status,

in order to check your eligibility for Products. We need this information to be able to provide the Eligibility Check Service to you including sending you the results of your eligibility check. If you do not provide this information you will not be able to benefit from the Eligibility Check Service.

(b) We use the personal information you provide to do a “soft search” or a “quotation search” on your credit file and compare your personal information with the acceptance criteria for the relevant Products. This involves us sharing your personal information with:

(i) Experian (our provider of eligibility checking services) in order to access your credit file, verify and validate the information you provide against Lender scorecards, publicly available databases (including credit reference agencies) and for fraud prevention purposes (please read Experian’s terms by a [clicking here](https://termsandconditions.hdd2.co.uk/TotallyMoney/)); and

(ii) in some cases, the specific third party credit issuers that provide the Products (“Lenders”) to check your eligibility for their Products (including whether or not you are an existing customer), to pre-populate any application form you elect to complete and for fraud prevention purposes.

Click [here](http://www.totallymoney.com/intelligent-alerts/) for more information about soft searches.

(c) Experian and the relevant Lenders send us the outcome of the Product eligibility checks, which is usually in the form of a score or percentage chance of acceptance. We use this information to provide you with your eligibility check results on the Site and we send the results to the email address provided to us by you.

(d) The purpose of this processing is to provide the Eligibility Check Service to you. Our legal basis for processing is contractual necessity (to perform the Eligibility Check Service requested by you).

(e) Lenders may provide us with limited data about the outcome of Product applications you make as a result of using our Services. This does not allow us to build a picture of all your applications or whether you were successful in every instance. In these cases, we may use such information to inform our future marketing strategies and to verify the commission payments due to us.

### 5.3 Intelligent Alerts Service (closed to new customers)

** Please note that we have now closed the Intelligent Alerts Service to new customers, and the service to existing customers will end 30 November 2018. Until then, if you are an existing Intelligent Alerts customer, you will continue to receive the service described in Paragraph 4A of the Terms and Conditions, and as set out below.**

### 5.5 Borrowing Power Service

Once you have registered for a TotallyMoney Account, we will start to provide the Borrowing Power Service to you to help give you an understanding of how much you might be able to borrow based on your credit rating and the Products that you might be eligible for. We work with Experian and Lenders to provide the Borrowing Power Service to you.

(a) We use the personal information you provide as part of your TotallyMoney Account registration to do a “soft search” or a “quotation search” on your credit file and compare your personal information with the acceptance criteria for Products. This involves us sharing your personal information with:

(i) Experian (our provider of pre-screening searches and eligibility checking services) in order to access your credit file, verify and validate the information you provide against publicly available databases for the purposes of providing the Borrowing Power Service and for fraud prevention purposes (please read Experian’s terms by [clicking here](https://termsandconditions.hdd2.co.uk/TotallyMoney/)); and

Click [here](http://www.totallymoney.com/intelligent-alerts/) for more information about soft searches.

(b) Experian provides us with information about key elements of your credit file and the Lenders send us the outcome of the Product eligibility checks. We use this information to provide you with an indication of what you might be able to borrow and make this information available to you when you log in to your TotallyMoney Account and also via the email address provided to us by you. We also use this information to build a more accurate picture of you and to improve and further personalise the Service.

(f) As explained in clause 5.3 of our [Terms and Conditions](http://www.totallymoney.com/info/terms/), we refresh the information every month to provide a better service to you.

### 5.6 Credit Report Services

(a) Callcredit Consumer Limited (“ **Callcredit** ”), who we work with to provide the Credit Report Service asks you for certain personal information to verify your identity and authenticate you for the Credit Report Service (these are knowledge based questions only you should know the answers to, based on your credit history). We do not see the information you provide (even though it is provided to Callcredit through a TotallyMoney branded interface as part of your TotallyMoney account registration) – we only see the outcome of this authentication (e.g. authentication pass/failure).

(b) Once you have registered for a TotallyMoney Account, provided that you complete Callcredit’s authentication process successfully and that your credit report can be found, we will start to provide the Credit Report Service to you to help give you an understanding of your credit report and score.

(c) We use Callcredit to provide the credit report and score services to you. Callcredit (i.e. Callcredit Consumer Limited) uses its group company Callcredit Limited, which is a credit reference agency, to provide some elements of the services, and the way in which your information is used by both companies is set out in the Callcredit Privacy Notice, which can be found [here](http://www.totallymoney.com/info/callcreditprivacy/). Callcredit’s company number is 07891157 and its registered office is One Park Lane, Leeds LS3 1EP. Callcredit Limited’s company number is 03961870 and the registered office is One Park Lane, Leeds LS3 1EP. Both Callcredit and Callcredit Limited are authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority under registration number 737740 (Callcredit Limited) and 737743 (Callcredit). Authorisation can be checked on the [Consumer Credit Register](https://register.fca.org.uk/).

(d) We share the personal information you provide as part of your TotallyMoney Account registration with Callcredit in order to be able to provide the Credit Report Services.

(e) If you are authenticated for the Credit Report Services by Callcredit, Callcredit provides us with a unique ID that we use to request your credit report and score data every month as long as you are active on the Site. Your credit score data will also be requested from Callcredit when you log into your TotallyMoney Account, so that we can provide you with a live score.

(f) We will store certain credit report and score data to the extent necessary to provide the Credit Report Services to you (for example, in order to present personalised information that loads quickly and is easy for you to use, we have to save the underlying information).

(g) We may use information contained in your credit report to personalise the Service we provide to you. We will do this to the extent necessary in order to provide the Service to you as described on our Site.

(h) We will request your credit report and score data from Callcredit and notify you that we have done so by email every month for as long as you have a live TotallyMoney Account.

### 5.7 Service messages

(a) We will send you emails as part of the Borrowing Power and Credit Report Services and we may also send you service messages in relation to your TotallyMoney Account or our Services from time to time (for example, to contact you about forgotten passwords or to notify you about changes to our Services).

(b) The retrieval of your credit report and score from Callcredit, and the calculation of your Borrowing Power using Experian data are core elements of the Account Service, and we want to make sure that you remember that we are obtaining this data about you each month, even when you may not need to log into your Account very often. Therefore, please be aware that you cannot unsubscribe from these messages and we will continue to send you your monthly Credit Report Service and Borrowing Power Service email as part of the Credit Report Service, to record that we have accessed your data for the purposes of providing you with our Account Services. If you do not wish to receive these messages, you will need to close your TotallyMoney Account by emailing help@totallymoney.com.

(c) In the absence of misuse or your account being suspended / terminated by us, we will only stop refreshing your borrowing power, credit report and score (and sending you notifications about these) if you close your TotallyMoney Account.

### 5.8 Marketing

(a) We will use your personal information to send you information about promotions, and to tailor what we send to you, about Products and services that may be of interest where we are legally permitted to do so or where you have consented to receiving direct marketing from us (for example, when you apply for a Fluid card). We may occasionally have arrangements in place with third parties that have a direct relationship with you and they may send information to you about us and our services where they are legally permitted to do so. You may be contacted by post, email, App push notification, via social media, telephone or such other means as we regard as appropriate and legally permitted.

(b) You may unsubscribe from receiving marketing communications at any time by updating your preferences from within your TotallyMoney Account, [contacting us](http://www.totallymoney.com/info/contact/), by emailing us at [help@totallymoney.com](mailto:help@totallymoney.com) or by clicking the unsubscribe link in any marketing email from us.

(c) We partner with third-party advertising companies who collect, store and use data by integrating cookies and other tracking software on our Services. Please see our Cookies Policy [here](http://www.totallymoney.com/info/cookie-policy/) for further information. In some cases these third parties will also use the data that they collect for their own purposes, for example they may aggregate your data with other data they hold and use this to inform advertising related services provided to other clients.

We might also share your data with social media or other similar platforms, so that you and other people can see relevant content on that platform. For example, we may use the Facebook Custom Audiences service and share your email address in a protected format with Facebook so that we can: include you in a custom audience that we will serve relevant advertising content to on Facebook; or create an audience of other Facebook users based on the information in your Facebook profile.

### 5.9 Correspondence with you

(a) If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.

(b) For research purposes, from time to time, we may ask you to complete a survey, although you do not have to respond. The purpose of such surveys are to help us improve, develop and update our Services and business. We believe we have a legitimate interest in handling your data for this purpose as it allows us to provide you with a better experience of our Services and the benefits of this outweigh any potential impact on you in storing and using your personal information in this way.

### 5.10 Website and app analytics

We capture details of your visits to the Site including the actual pages you visit, IP address (from which we may derive your location) and other communication data and details of the resources that you access. We also capture information about your computer or device including, where available, your operating system and browser type. This is used for system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers and to enable us to analyse behaviour and trends on the Site. This is statistical data about our users’ browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.

We believe we have a legitimate interest in handling your data for this purpose as it allows us to provide you with customer and technical support and a better experience of our Services and the benefits of this outweigh any potential impact on you in storing and using your personal information in this way.

### 5.11 To meet legal or regulatory requirements

We and our third party service providers are required to comply with certain legal and regulatory requirements and we may process your personal information in order to comply with those requirements. Occasionally, we may be asked to provide certain information to regulators or law enforcement agencies and we will comply with these requests where legally required or permitted.

This processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we or the regulator/law enforcement agency are subject.

This will be marked as a “quotation” search and will not affect your ability to gain credit. The CRA may use the information you provide when setting up your TotallyMoney Account and in the course of using the Services for the purposes of operating as a credit reference agency. This will include using such data for statistical purposes, to assist with identity verification, prevention of fraud / money laundering, tracing and collection of debt, service delivery and process implementation.

**6.2** For the purposes of compliance monitoring by The Financial Conduct Authority, Information Commissioner and/or other regulatory/governing bodies it is our legal obligation to disclose or share your personal data. This is also the case when we want to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; to protect the rights, property or safety of our staff, customers – or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of ID verification and validation, fraud protection and credit risk reduction. The legal basis of this processing is that it is necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations or for our legitimate interests.

**6.4** From time to time, we may consider corporate transactions such as a merger, acquisition, reorganisation, asset sale, or similar. In these instances, we may transfer or allow access to information to enable the assessment and undertaking of that transaction. If we are acquired in whole or part, either through a sale of shares or assets, customer personal data may be one of the assets transferred. The legal basis for this processing will be that it is for our legitimate interests.

## 7\. How and where we store your personal information and security

**7.1** All of the information that you give us is stored on secure servers. We will periodically review this information to ensure that we do not keep it for any longer than is necessary.

**7.2** The internet is not a secure medium. However, we have put in place various security procedures to protect your information. Firewalls are used to block unauthorised traffic to the servers – and the actual servers are located in a secure location which can only be accessed by authorised personnel. We use industry-standard encryption technology to ensure that all your personal and transactional information is encrypted before transmission to certain Lenders or third party service providers. Our security policies are in place to safeguard your privacy from unauthorised access or improper use – and we will continue to enhance our security as and when new technology becomes available.

**7.3** Where possible, you should not provide us with any personal information that we have not requested. If you are unsure whether we need a certain piece of information, please ask us first before sending it to us.

**7.4** From time to time, we or our service providers may communicate with you by email. You should keep your email account secure.

**7.5** Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access your online account, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

## 8\. Transfers of personal information

**8.1** The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") (including to the United States) in connection with the above purposes.

**8.2** If we transfer any of your personal information outside of the EEA, we will take steps necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely – and in accordance with this privacy notice and all relevant statutory requirements. These measures include:

(a) in the case of US based entities, entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with them, or ensuring they have signed up to the EU-US Privacy Shield (see further <https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome>); or

(b) in the case of entities based in other countries outside the EEA (including Japan), entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with them.

**8.3** Further details on the steps we take to protect your personal information, in these cases is available from us on request by contacting us by email at [dpo@totallymoney.com](mailto:dpo@totallymoney.com) at any time.

## 9\. Data retention

**9.1 TotallyMoney Account:** Upon closure of your TotallyMoney Account for any reason, we will remove our live records of you, and archive limited personal information for the purposes of responding to legal and regulatory enquiries and for our own required record keeping. We will keep the archived data for no longer than six years following your TotallyMoney Account closure.

**9.2 General:** We keep your personal information for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which the personal information is processed. The length of time we retain personal information for depends on the purposes for which we collect and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws and to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights.
