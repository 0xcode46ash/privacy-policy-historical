# Privacy Statements

## Privacy Policy

### Payments

All payments are processed through third party payment systems, which have their own privacy policies outside of our control. However, any information provided to us by them is dealt with as if we had collected it directly. 

### Data retention

Any information we may have about people or organisations, we retain purely to help identify licensees and subscribers should they lose their details, or to provide subscription reminders, or where we are legally obliged to for tax and accounting. 

### Disclosures

Total Validator does not sell, trade, or rent to third parties any information collected by us. We will not explicitly share any such information with third parties except where it may be necessary to comply with the law, apply the terms of our user agreements, or protect the rights of Total Validator. 

### Unsolicited contact

We hate spam as much as anyone else, so no form of unsolicited contact will ever be made by us. We do send email reminders when a subscription is about to expire, but you can opt-out of this using our [subscriptions form](https://web.archive.org/web/20170923184434id_/https%3A//www.totalvalidator.com/purchases/renewals.html), or by [sending us an email](mailto:support@totalvalidator.com).
