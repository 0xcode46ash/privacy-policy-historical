# TOTO USA’s Privacy Policy

TOTO USA respects the privacy of users who visit this Site. The following policies are in effect for all of the Web pages operated as www.totousa.com. Please read our Privacy Policy from time to time, since we may modify it. If we make substantive changes, we will post a notice on our Site and invite you to review the new Policy. _**Keeping Your Information Secure.**_

Keeping your personal information secure is one of our most important responsibilities. We value your trust and handle your information with care. We will safeguard, according to established standards of security and confidentiality, any information our users share with us. Our employees access information about you when needed to maintain your accounts or otherwise meet your needs. We may also access information about you when considering a request from you for additional services or when exercising our rights under the law or any agreement with you. We continually access new technology for protecting information. Our employees are trained to understand and comply with these information principles.

We may also ask you to elect a user name and password or identification number to gain access to certain portions of our Site. We may also ask you to provide optional demographic information such as your zip code, your age range, or your product preferences. When a visitor requests pages on the TOTO USA site, our servers automatically recognize the browser's domain name and IP address. Our servers also record e-mail addresses that you submit for registration.

We may use "cookies" (small pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive) to track sessions and to personalize your experience on our Site. Such uses allow us to improve our site and better tailor it to meet our users' needs.

When you register for any TOTO USA services, your user name and password are recorded solely for the purpose of maintaining your own accounts within the Site. 

_**How TOTO USA Uses Your Information.**_

TOTO USA will not sell, rent or share personally identifiable information about you to any unaffiliated third party unless we have previously informed you in disclosures or agreements, have been authorized by you, or are required by law. If we receive a subpoena or similar legal process demanding release of any information about you, we will generally attempt to notify you (unless we believe we are prohibited from doing so). Except as required by law or as described above, we do not share information with other parties, including government agencies. By posting e-mails or voice mails through TOTO USA you understand that the information is not secure. 

We may use personally identifiable information about you to customize your experience on the TOTO USA Site, to analyze site usage, and to improve our content and product offerings. We use the e-mail address you submitted in the registration process to deliver information about our services to you through our newsletters and to invite you to participate in surveys about products or services. If you do not want to participate in our surveys or if you are not interested in receiving other contacts from us, you may "opt-out" on survey and registration forms by checking the box "No, I would not like to be added to TOTO's email list." 

We may share information with third parties which is based on our experiential or other data which does not personally identify any of our users. This may include such information as product or service preferences within certain sectors of our user base for instance. 

We may use your demographic or site use information to determine the advertisements that are displayed on our Site. However, our advertisers do not have access to your personal information. 

If you would like to e-mail a page or pages from our Site to a friend, we will collect the recipient’s e-mail address for purposes of that transmission. However, we do not maintain a permanent record of that address unless the recipient independently registers with TOTO USA.

_**TOTO USA and Children.**_

TOTO USA does not knowingly solicit data from children, and we do not knowingly market to children. Our terms and conditions of use require that any registration may only be made by those over the age of 18. If we have reason to believe that information is being provided by a child under the age of 18 TOTO USA will not collect the information without parental consent or parental notification, which will include the opportunity for the parent to prevent the use of the information or to prevent the child’s participation in the activity. Without parental consent, online information will only be used to respond to an unsolicited request and for no other purposes. We recognize that protecting children’s identities and privacy online is important and that the responsibility to do so rests with both the online industry and with parents.
