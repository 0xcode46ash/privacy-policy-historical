Total France is very concerned about privacy issues. Please read the following: 

**Cookies** We do not use cookies to obtain or transmit personal information about you. Our cookies simply record data such as your language preference, your login status, and other site-specific information to enhance your experience of using Total France. This cookie information is stored on **your** computer, not on ours. Cookies do not gather personal information. See more [cookie information here](https://web.archive.org/web/20061230183005id_/http%3A//www.totalfrance.com/france/help.php?pick=cookies). 

**IP address** We collect, keep, and publish your IP address on your posted adverts. We do this to help protect all users from fraudulent postings and spam. 

**Personal Details** Any personal details you submit, either when registering or when placing an ad, will not be disclosed by us to third party mailing lists or sellers. Total France has a rigid anti-spam policy, principally because we are sick of receiving so much of it ourselves. This means we will not tolerate a user attempting to spam other users, nor will we be spamming you. If you receive spam from any other user please notify us immediately. 

**Email addresses** Your email address will be used by us to communicate messages to you such as ad responses, your user details, ad expiry notices, etc. Occasionally the webmaster may mail you directly, or as part of a newsletter mailing, if there is anything important to tell you. 

**Login Details** We will never disclose your Login information. We will never email you to ask for your Login information. If you ever receive such an email it could be a malicious hoax; please report it to us. Our system is set up to email your login information to you automatically if you have forgotten it (just click on the 

_Lost Password_ link). 

**Other sites** Certain ads and forum postings may contain links to other websites ... our Links page certainly will. Total France cannot be held responsible either for the content or for the privacy practices of any other web sites.
