# Total Telecom - Privacy

## Privacy: Protecting your data

Total Telecom and its group companies (together, "Terrapinn") are committed to safeguarding the privacy of the users of the Total Telecom website, while providing a service which is tailored to suit their needs. Please take a moment to read our Privacy Policy as it describes what happens to the personal information which you supply to Total Telecom. Total Telecom reserves the right to change the terms of this Privacy Policy from time to time.

1\. What information does Total Telecom hold about you and how is it collected?

If you register on the Total Telecom site, your personal information (including your name, job title, company's name, telephone, fax and mobile numbers, postal and email address) is collected by Total Telecom. We also collect personal information from you when you contact us (by email or otherwise).

In common with many other websites and online services, we may use "cookies" to store and sometimes track information about you, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, but only on an anonymous basis. None of the information we store via cookies is linked to personally identifiable information (PPI). A cookie is a small amount of data sent from the server which is stored on your PC's hard drive. You can set your browser to refuse cookies or ask your browser to show you where cookies have been set up. Certain services are only activated by the presence of a cookie and, if you choose to reject the cookie, a particular on-line feature may not be available to you.

2\. What does Total Telecom do with your personal information?

All of the personal information described above will be stored on Total Telecom’s user database (unless you notify us that you no longer wish us to retain such information, in which case it will be deleted). Total Telecom will only use your personal information in order to contact you (for example by email, mail or telephone) for those purposes to which you have previously consented on the site. For example, if you register on the site, Total Telecom will email to you Total Telecom’s newsletter and, if you wish, contact you about relevant products and services offered by Total Telecom or by reputable third parties. If you do not wish to receive information about Total Telecom’s and/or third parties' products and services, please tick the relevant box on the registration form when you register or, subsequently, via the "edit my profile" button at the bottom of the home page. You may cancel your subscription to Total Telecom’s newsletter at any time by clicking on the link at the foot of any edition of the newsletter.

Total Telecom will also use the information which you provide in aggregate form (i.e. so that no individual users are identifiable) to determine demographic profiles and browsing patterns in order to: develop marketing profiles and assist strategic development; manage Total Telecom’s relationship with its sponsors and advertisers; enable site audits to be performed; and enable Total Telecom to review, develop and improve the services which it offers.

Total Telecom may use Google Analytics for the following purposes:

• Remarketing (serving ads on 3rd party websites). Total Telecom and 3rd-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve and target ads based on past visits and interactions with our website.

• Google Display Network Impression Reporting. Total Telecom and 3rd-party vendors use cookies to understand and report on how ad impressions, interactions with ads and other ad services are related to visits to our website.

• Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. Total Telecom use information from Google's Interest-based advertising or 3rd-party audience data (such as gender, age and interests) with Google Analytics to influence our marketing strategy. Personal information is not captured unless expressly provided by the user.

You may opt out of the Google Analytics Display Advertiser Features through [Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads?hl=en-GB) in your Google Account. You may also opt out of Google Analytics using this [browser ad-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

3\. To whom is your personal information disclosed?

Total Telecom will share your personal information with the other members of its group and (provided that you have not ticked the opt-out box on the registration form) will make your name and postal address available to reputable third parties so that they can send you details of their products and services. In supplying Total Telecom with your personal information, you agree that Total Telecom may transfer that information (to the extent that it is still held on our database at the relevant time) to a third party who acquires all or substantially all or Total Telecom’s assets or stock or our website services whether by merger, acquisition, reorganisation or otherwise. Total Telecom will not otherwise disclose your personal information to any third parties.

4\. Transfers of personal information overseas

As the internet is a global environment, using the internet to collect and process personal information necessarily involves the transmission of that information worldwide. Total Telecom will also share your personal information with members of its group which are located overseas. By registering on the Total Telecom site and communicating with us, you acknowledge and agree to our processing of your personal information in this way.

5\. When does this Privacy Policy not apply?

This Privacy Policy only applies to the collection and use of data by Total Telecom. It does not cover third party sites to which we provide links. Those sites may have their own privacy policies. If you send to us contributions containing personal information to be posted on the Total Telecom site, this information will be publicly accessible and is not covered by this Privacy Policy.

6\. How do we protect your information?

Total Telecom is committed to data security. If you subscribe to access our premium content (and, accordingly, enter payment details), Total Telecom offers the use of a secure server. The secure server software encrypts all information which you input before it is sent to Total Telecom. Total Telecom takes steps to guard against unauthorised access to the personal information of the users of its site. Although it makes every effort to create a secure environment for your personal information, Total Telecom cannot guarantee the safety of any personal information which is transmitted to us on-line.
