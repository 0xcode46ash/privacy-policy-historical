This Privacy Policy covers the privacy practices that Totango LLC.

It explains what data we collect, including Personally our Identifiable Information (defined below), about (i) Customers; and (ii) the customers and clients of our Customers (“End Users”), and how we collect, use and retain such data.  The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which our clients have engaged Totango.

1\.          Introduction. We are committed to respecting privacy and recognize the need for appropriate protection and management of any Personally Identifiable Information that is shared with us as part of the Service. As used in this Privacy Policy, “Personally Identifiable Information” means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, personal profile, a home or other physical address, an email address or other contact information.

2\.          Totango Service Description. We provide the Service in order to enable our Customers to collect information about their End Users’ activities on their web service and/or other software services offering (“Customer Service”) and to provide our Customers with a global view of those activities.

3\.          What Information We Collect and How We Collect It.  As the provider of the Service, we receive and/or collect data, which may contain Personally Identifiable Information, in the following ways:

3.1. Customer Account Information. As part of the Service, we may collect or obtain information (including Personally Identifiable Information) that a Customer provides about itself, such as the Customer’s account name, and email address, company information and related information about its personnel (“Customer Data”).

3.2. End User Data. As part of the Service, a Customer may provide us with data, including Personally Identifiable Information, such as a user’s email address to store on the Customer’s behalf about an End User in connection with the End User’s use of the Customer Service (“End User Data”).
