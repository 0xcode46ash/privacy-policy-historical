Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy covers the privacy practices that Totango Ltd. (“Totango”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) employs in providing the Totango Service (the “Service”) to our customers, including their personnel (collectively, “Customer(s)”). It explains what data we collect, including Personally Identifiable Information (defined below), about (i) our Customers; and (ii) the customers and clients of our Customers (“End Users”), and how we collect, use and retain such data.

1\.          Introduction. We are committed to respecting privacy and recognize the need for appropriate protection and management of any Personally Identifiable Information that is shared with us as part of the Service. As used in this Privacy Policy, “Personally Identifiable Information” means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, personal profile, a home or other physical address, an email address or other contact information.

2\.          Totango Service Description. We provide the Service in order to enable our Customers to collect information about their End Users’ activities on their web service and/or other software services offering (“Customer Service”) and to provide our Customers with a global view of those activities.

3\.          What Information We Collect and How We Collect It.  As the provider of the Service, we receive and/or collect data, which may contain Personally Identifiable Information, in the following ways:

3.1. Customer Account Information. As part of the Service, we may collect or obtain information (including Personally Identifiable Information) that a Customer provides about itself, such as the Customer’s account name and email address and related information about its personnel (“Customer Data”).

3.2. End User Data. As part of the Service, a Customer may provide us with data, including Personally Identifiable Information, to store on the Customer’s behalf about an End User in connection with the End User’s use of the Customer Service (“End User Data”).

3.3. Transactions. We may collect or obtain information, including Personally Identifiable Information, from each Customer in order to complete the Customer’s subscription to the Service. Such information could include a credit card number, related account and billing information, and other data required to process the order. We may update such data should a Customer grant us permission to bill a credit card for recurring charges, such as monthly or other types of periodic payments. We may use the tools, software or services of third party service providers to process transactions on our behalf, in which case the terms of use and/or privacy policy of said third party service provider shall also apply to the transaction.

3.4. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies. Each Customer may configure the Service so that it utilizes “cookies” and other tracking technologies. A “cookie” is a small text file that we may use to collect and send information about (i) a Customer’s Service activity; and (ii) an End User’s use of a Customer Service. For example, such information may include the IP address from which End Users access a Customer Service, the date and time of access, the pages visited, and other statistics. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personally Identifiable Information previously obtained from a Customer or an End User. Our cookies cannot be used to access any other data on a Customer’s or an End User’s hard drive or (except with respect to an IP address) to personally identify a Customer or an End User.  In any event, each Customer and End User may block incoming cookies or delete existing cookies by adjusting the appropriate setting on its own browser.

4\.          The Way We Use Information.

4.1. We will use the Customer Data of a Customer to provide and improve our Service to the Customer, to contact the Customer, and to identify and authenticate the Customer’s access to our services that the Customer is authorized to access.

4.2. We will store End User Data on behalf of the related Customer in order to provide the Service to that Customer.

4.3. We may engage third party hosting providers to store information, including Personally Identifiable Information, on our behalf. Such information may be stored on servers located in different countries around the world. We only engage third party hosting providers that post a privacy policy governing their processing of Personally Identifiable Information.

4.4. We may transfer Personally Identifiable Information to our affiliated companies located in other countries around the world in order for them to perform business functions or services for us or on our behalf.  We require that these affiliated companies agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy.

4.5. We reserve the right to retain any Personally Identifiable Information and other Service-related data for such time as we are providing the Service to the Customer to which the information relates and for a reasonable time thereafter.  In any event, we will delete or amend any Customer’s or End User’s Personally Identifiable Information that we are storing if we receive a written request to do so.  Any such request should be addressed to privacy@totango.com and include sufficient information for Totango to identify the Customer or End User and the information to delete or amend.

4.6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may disclose Personally Identifiable Information or any information that we receive in connection with the Service if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to (i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; or (ii) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Totango, our Customers, End Users, or the public.

5\.          Anonymous Information. We may use Anonymous Information (defined below), or disclose it to third party service providers, to provide, improve and/or develop the Service. From time to time, we may disclose Anonymous Information as part of our participation in an industry wide benchmark for the benefit of the online software community.  Each Customer may opt-out from such benchmarks at any time by emailing us at privacy@totango.com. “Anonymous Information” means information which does not enable identification of an individual user, such as aggregated information, about the use of the Service.

6\.          Children’s Privacy. The Service is not structured to attract children under the age of 18. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personally Identifiable Information from anyone we know to be under 18 years.

7\.          In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Change of Control.

7.1. We may transfer or assign this Privacy Policy and any Personally Identifiable Information to a third party entity that acquires or is merged with Totango as part of a merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control (“Change of Control”). Should such a Change of Control occur, Totango will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use the Personally Identifiable Information in a manner that is consistent with Totango’s privacy policies.

8\.          Security. The security of Personally Identifiable Information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personally Identifiable Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We use SSL technology to encrypt data during transmission, and we also employ application-layer security features to further anonymize sensitive data. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Personally Identifiable Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

9\.          Modification. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change the terms of this Privacy Policy at any time. Such change will become effective thirty (30) days following notification to our Customers by email or by posting an updated version on our website[ www.totango.com](http://www.totango.com/) and shall not affect Personally Identifiable Information collected prior to the date when the change becomes effective.

10\.    Contacting Us. Any comments, concerns, complaints, or questions regarding our Privacy Policy may be addressed to: privacy@totango.com.
