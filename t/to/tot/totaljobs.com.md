At totaljobs we make every effort to comply with our obligations under the 1998 Data Protection Act. Additionally, we understand the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of your CV and other information you may give us while using the site. 

Except for the information about your computer described below under 'cookies', all the information we hold about you is provided by you.

Registration details   
Contact and other details you supply as part of the registration process are stored by us and used to provide you with the information you have requested. 

Profile and CV information   
When you complete your totaljobs profile, including your CV, it can be made available for viewing and downloading by our customers, by way of a search over the Internet. These may be direct recruiters, employment consultants or other organisations, who pay us for such access.   
You can choose to prevent our customers from accessing your personal details, CV and profile.   
You can also choose to make your Personal details and your CV anonymous, while having your profile available to be searched on by recruiters. In this instance, totaljobs.com identifies you to recruiters with an ID number. You can then choose to reveal your self when you reply. 

IMPORTANT: Your current employer may be a customer of totaljobs, or a client of one of our customers. Totaljobs cannot restrict the customers who access profiles on our database and cannot be held responsible for any eventuality. As part of the registration process totaljobs offers you the option of remaining anonymous.   
Some of our customers may be located in countries outside the European Economic Area.   
When you create your profile, and store your CV on 'my totaljobs', we store the information for you but it is protected by your password and may only be accessed by you. It does not form part of our totaljobs CV database and cannot be searched or accessed by totaljobs customers. You can delete it at any time. Your CV can only be viewed by a totaljobs customer if you have consented to this within the profile section.   
We rely on you to ensure that your CV and contact details are kept up to date. You should update your CV at least every six months, particularly if your contact details have changed. Once your profile and CV are on our database we will contact you every six months using your most recent contact details to ask whether you want it to remain there. If we do not hear from you, your profile and CV will be removed from our database. 

Graduate Match Information   
When you complete a Graduate Career Match with totaljobs, your name and contact details, together with your academic details and your report will be stored on the Selby Millsmith database. They will then be made available to be viewed and downloaded, by way of an online search over the Internet, by totaljobs customers. These customers may be direct recruiters, employment consultants or other organisations, who pay us for such access. 

IMPORTANT: Your current employer may be either a customer of totaljobs or a client of one of our customers.
