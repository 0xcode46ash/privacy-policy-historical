### I. General

TollFreeForwarding.com respects the privacy of every individual who visits our website and responds to our interactive advertisements or sends us email.

### II. Security

All online order forms from TollFreeForwarding.com utilize a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol to provide "secure sessions" for our visitors. Through the "secure session," information that you input into a TollFreeForwarding.com online order form will be sent and will arrive privately and unaltered at a TollFreeForwarding.com server. This security prohibits other companies and web users from being able to access your information.

Examples of this type of information include the type of Internet browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using and the domain name of the website and/or Internet Service Provider from which you linked to our site or advertisement.
