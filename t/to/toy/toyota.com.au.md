# Toyota Australia: Privacy Policy

## Privacy policy december 09

Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Limited (‘Toyota’) aims to provide its customers with the best possible products and service. To achieve this, we aim to make efficient use of the personal information we collect from our customers.

We also want our customers to have confidence that in handling personal information, we afford that information an appropriate level of privacy, consistent with the National Privacy Principles.

This statement sets out our policy for dealing with your personal information

### What is Personal Information?

Personal Information is any information about you that identifies you, or by which your identity can reasonably be ascertained.

Why personal information is collected by Toyota  
Toyota (including its related bodies corporate) collects personal information from its customers and suppliers, or employees or officers of its customers and suppliers, for purposes relating to the products and services it offers. Those purposes include:

  * responding to enquiries regarding vehicles and vehicle sales, products and accessories and services we offer
  * receiving feedback and dealing with complaints
  * processing orders and administering accounts
  * providing customer and dealer support
  * applications for employment
  * vehicle warranties and product recalls
  * marketing and promotional activities
  * product development and market research
  * meeting our regulatory and legal obligations.



If we are unable to collect personal information we require, we may not be able to do business with you or the organisation with which you are connected.

### How does Toyota collect personal information?

Where possible, Toyota will collect your personal information directly from you. This may take place in a number of ways, such as when you give us a written order or ask us to provide a product or service over the telephone or internet.

Our Web site may also offer interactive facilities, such as customer enquiry or comment forms and competition entry forms, where personal information may be collected. In addition, we may obtain personal information from third parties such as our dealers and distributors, contractors and regulatory authorities.

Regardless of who provides personal information to us, it will always be handled by Toyota in accordance with this privacy policy and the National Privacy Principles.

### Do we disclose personal information to anyone else? 

In providing you with a product or service, we may sometimes need to disclose your personal information to others. It is generally our policy not to disclose information to external organisations, however, examples of the types of organisations we may need to disclose information to in the course of providing a product or service are:

  * related bodies corporate
  * Toyota dealers
  * parts suppliers
  * insurers and financiers
  * a person outside Toyota who is contracted to us to provide a particular service on our behalf.



Some examples of the kinds of organisations with which we contract are

  * mailing houses for bulk mailing of letters and notices;
  * printers for marketing material;
  * information technology service providers; and
  * accountants, lawyers and other service providers.



Those contracted parties are not authorised by us to use personal information for anything other than the purpose for which we supplied that information to them. Some of our information technology service providers are located overseas and, as a result, personal information collected and held by Toyota may be transferred overseas.

Sometimes, the law requires us to disclose personal information. For example, information may be disclosed to a court in response to a subpoena or to a Government agency such as a vehicle licensing authority or the Australian Taxation Office.

We may also disclose personal information where the individual consents to us doing so. That consent may be written, verbal or implied from your conduct.

### Direct marketing

From time to time, we may use personal information to inform our customers about our products and services, or about special offers and promotions that we think may be of interest to you. We will generally give you the opportunity to express a wish not to receive direct marketing communications. You can let us know at any time if you no longer wish to receive marketing material (by contacting us by any of the means set out below) and we will remove your details from our direct marketing database.

Toyota does not disclose personal information to organisations outside Toyota and its related companies for the purposes of allowing them to direct market their products. However, we may join motor vehicle dealers and other business associates of Toyota in joint marketing of our respective products and services to customers.

If the law requires us to provide you with information about our products or services, we will provide that information even if you have elected not to receive information about our products and services generally.

### Ensuring personal information is up-to-date

We rely on the personal information we hold in conducting our business. Therefore, it is very important that the information we hold is accurate, complete and up-to-date.

We do everything we can to ensure that the personal information we hold is accurate complete and up-to-date whenever we collect or use it. This means that from time to time, we will ask you to tell us if there are any changes to your personal information. If you find that information we hold about you is incorrect, please contact us immediately and we will correct it.

### Security of personal information

Security of personal information is important to us and we take all reasonable precautions to protect personal information from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.  
Some of the ways we protect personal information include:

  * external and internal premises security;
  * restricting access to personal information only to staff who need it to perform their day to day functions;
  * maintaining technology products to prevent unauthorised computer access or damage to electronically stored information, such as requiring identifiers and passwords, firewalls and anti-virus software; and
  * maintaining physical security over paper records.



### Access to personal information by individuals

You can access most of the personal information we hold about you by contacting us by any of the means set out below.

We may charge an access fee to cover the reasonable cost of retrieving the information and supplying it to you.

Access to personal information may be refused in a number of circumstances, such as where the information relates to anticipated legal proceedings or the request for access is frivolous or vexatious. If we deny or restrict your access, we will explain why.

### Privacy and our website at http://www.toyota.com.au

The type of personal information we collect on our website depends on how you make use of the site.

When you visit the site, our host, records your server address, domain name, the date and time of the visit and the pages viewed.

If you disable the use of cookies, your use of our site may be affected. Information collected about your visit to our site is retained for statistical and website development reasons and is not in a form which would enable us to identify you.

The information provided may also be retained for product planning purposes, and unless you tell us that you don’t want it used for direct marketing purposes, may be used for those purposes.

### If you send us an email

If you send us an email containing personal information, we will take reasonable steps to ensure the confidentiality of that information. The content of emails is sometimes monitored by our Internet Host for maintenance and fault detection purposes. We may also monitor email for legal compliance purposes. E-mails may also be sent to our dealers or contractors when they relate to product or service enquiries or complaints. They also treat the information confidentially, but do record it in our in-house database.

Although we take steps to protect information sent by e-mail, e-mail is not a secure method of communication and if you are concerned about sending your personal information to us in this manner you may prefer to contact us by any of the other means set out below.

### What is Personal Information?

Personal Information is any information about an individual that identifies them or by which their identity can reasonably be ascertained.

### Why personal information is collected by TFS?

TFS collects the personal information it needs to provide the products and services it offers. Those products and services include various types of motor vehicle finance, warranties, insurance products and other financial services within Australia.

TFS also collects personal information about its customers and suppliers (including dealers), or employees or officers of its customers and suppliers, so that it can complete business transactions, purchase products and services, administer accounts, provide customer support, respond to customer inquiries and requests for product information and meet regulatory requirements. 

If TFS is unable to collect personal information from or about an individual, it may not be able to do business with that individual or the organisation with which the individual is connected.

Where relevant, we will handle personal information about our current and former employees relying on the exemption in the Privacy Act relating to employee records. 

### How does TFS collect personal information?

Where possible, TFS will collect personal information directly from the individual it relates to. This may take place in a number of ways, such as when an application for a product or service is completed or a product or service is requested over the telephone or internet. 

We will also collect personal information during the course of our relationship with customers, for example where a loan is refinanced or the terms of an arrangement with us are varied.

Sometimes, personal information may be collected from a source other than the individual to which it relates. Some examples are: 

  * where we obtain a credit report about an individual from a credit reporting agency in the course of assessing a loan application;
  * from an accountant where we approach the accountant in assessing a loan application;
  * where an individual is an officer of a company that has applied for finance with us, we may obtain information about the officer from public records or from other officers of the company who arrange the company's finance application; and 
  * from the motor vehicle dealership where a vehicle is purchased or finance with TFS is arranged.



Regardless of who provides personal information to us, it will always be handled by TFS in accordance with this privacy policy.

### Do we disclose personal information to anyone else?

In providing our customers with their chosen product or service, TFS may sometimes need to disclose personal information to others. Examples of the types of organisations we may need to disclose information to in the course of providing a product or service are:

  * the vehicle manufacturer (including TMCA) or supplier of the vehicle or any extended warranty taken out in connection with the vehicle that is the subject of the finance;
  * insurers under insurance policies applied for or taken out in connection with the vehicle that is the subject of the finance, or in connection with the finance itself (for example consumer credit insurance);
  * a guarantor if a finance arrangement is guaranteed; and
  * parties outside TFS where that party is contracted to us to provide a particular service on our behalf and is bound by the same privacy rules we follow.



Some examples of the kinds of organisations contracted by TFS are:

  * mailing houses for bulk mailing of letters and notices;
  * printers for direct marketing material;
  * debt collection agencies; and
  * lawyers.



Those contracted parties are not authorised by TFS to use personal information for anything other than the purpose for which TFS supplies that information to them.

Sometimes, the law requires us to disclose personal information. For example, information may be disclosed to a court in response to a subpoena or to a Government agency such as the Australian Taxation Office on receipt of a direction issued under taxation laws. 

We may disclose personal information to our related companies both in and outside Australia.

We may also disclose an individual's personal information where the individual consents to us doing so. That consent may be written, verbal or implied from the individual's conduct. 

### Direct marketing

From time to time, we may use personal information to inform our customers about our products and services including special offers. We may also send our customers material relating to joint promotions with motor vehicle dealers and other business associates of TFS of our respective products and services. 

If an individual does not wish to receive this information, they just need to let us know by contacting the TFS Customer Service Centre on 137 200.

Once an individual lets us know that they no longer wish to receive this information, we will stop sending it. The individual can change their mind about receiving information about our products and services at any time. They just need to let us know by phoning the above number. 

If the law requires us to provide our customers with information about our products or services, we will provide that information even if an individual has elected not to receive information about our products and services generally.

### The dealer network

We would like to be able to make certain personal information about our customers available to our accredited motor vehicle dealers to assist those dealers to better serve customer needs (for example, to save customers time when they contact one of our accredited dealers about vehicle servicing, roadside assistance, advice on a vehicle's features and performance or purchase of a new vehicle).

The information shared with accredited dealers will not include any credit or financial information. It will be limited to identity details (such as name, address, driver's licence number and date of birth) and contact details (home and work/business). 

If an individual does not wish us to share their information with our accredited dealer network in this way, they just need to let us know by contacting the TFS Customer Service Centre on 137 200.

### Ensuring personal information is up-to-date

We rely on the personal information we hold in conducting our business. Therefore, it is very important that the information we hold is accurate, complete and up-to-date.

We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we hold is accurate complete and up-to-date whenever we collect or use it. This means that from time to time, we will ask individuals to tell us if there are any changes to their personal information. If an individual finds that information we hold about them is incorrect, they should contact us immediately and we will correct it. 

### Security of personal information

The security of information is important to TFS and we take all reasonable precautions to protect personal information from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. 

Some of the ways we protect personal information include:

  * external and internal premises security;
  * restricted access to personal information to staff who need it to perform their day to day functions;
  * maintaining technology products to prevent unauthorised computer access including identifiers and passwords; and
  * maintaining physical security over paper records.



### Access to personal information by individuals

An individual can access most of the personal information TFS holds about them by contacting the TFS Customer Service Centre on 137 200. 

Depending on the amount of information requested, TFS may charge an access fee to cover the cost of retrieving the information and supplying it to the person who has requested access.

Access to personal information may be refused in a number of circumstances, such as where the information relates to anticipated legal proceedings or the request for access is frivolous or vexatious. If we deny or restrict an individual's access, we will explain why.

If an individual disables the use of cookies, the use of our site by that individual may be affected. Information collected about an individual's visit to the TFS site is retained for statistical and website development reasons and is not in a form, which would enable us to identify the individual to which the information relates.

An individual who visits the site will not be required to provide TFS with any personal information unless that individual requests information about a TFS product or service. In that case, we will ask the individual to provide contact details along with other information required to respond to the individual's request. The information provided may also be retained for product planning purposes, and unless the relevant individual asks us not to do so, for marketing purposes.

Although TFS takes steps to protect information sent by e-mail, e-mail is not a secure method of communication and individuals who are concerned about sending their personal information to us in this manner may prefer to call the TFS Customer Service Centre on 137 200.

Whenever possible, we collect your personal information from you. However, we may collect personal information about you from someone else. For example, if you apply for, receive or acquire a Toyota Insurance product or service via our intermediaries, (our distributors or other appointed representatives), our intermediaries may, (but only with your consent) obtain a credit report about you from a credit agency for the purposes of loan application assessment, or obtain financial details from your accountant.

### Why do we collect your personal information and how is it used?

We collect this information for purposes which include communicating with customers, setting premiums appropriately, assessing and paying claims, compiling statistics, providing products and services and, subject to your consent, for marketing purposes. 

We will only provide your personal information to government authorities if required by law. 

If necessary, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party (for example, Toyota Financial Services) when processing a claim, validating and confirming information, administering policies and where customer research is conducted by us or on our behalf. 

Examples of third parties include other insurance companies, (to confirm your insurance profile), claims assessors, (when a claim requires assessment or investigation), the insurance reference bureau, consumer research organisations, a guarantor noted on a finance contract and finance companies (only if noted on your policy documents).

Personal information that we store on our systems is protected by the use of secure passwords and identifiers. We maintain up to date technology to prevent unauthorised computer access.

Access to personal information is limited to those who specifically require it in order to discharge their business or professional responsibilities. 

We also maintain physical security procedures to manage and protect the use and storage of personal information contained on paper.

There is no charge for making a request.

### When may a request for access to documents be denied?

We may deny access to some or all of the documents requested by our customers. A request will be denied, for example, if a document contains: 

  1. Confidential information provided by people or organisations other than our customers;
  2. Information that may lead to the identification of the person/s or organisation/s who provided the confidential information; or
  3. Commercially sensitive information, for example, which discloses our claims investigation procedures.

### If you have a complaint relating to Privacy
