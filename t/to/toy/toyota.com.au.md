# Toyota Privacy Policy

## Toyota website privacy policy

Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Limited ('Toyota') aims to provide its customers with the best possible products and service. To achieve this, we aim to make efficient use of the personal information we collect from our customers.

We also want our customers to have confidence that in handling personal information, we afford that information an appropriate level of privacy, consistent with the National Privacy Principles.

This statement sets out our policy for dealing with your personal information

### What is Personal Information?

Personal Information is any information about you that identifies you, or by which your identity can reasonably be ascertained.

### Why personal information is collected by Toyota

Toyota (including its related bodies corporate) collects personal information from its customers and suppliers, or employees or officers of its customers and suppliers, for purposes relating to the products and services it offers. Those purposes include:

  * responding to enquiries regarding vehicles and vehicle sales, products and accessories and services we offer
  * receiving feedback and dealing with complaints
  * processing orders and administering accounts
  * providing customer and dealer support
  * applications for employment
  * vehicle warranties and product recalls
  * marketing and promotional activities
  * product development and market research
  * meeting our regulatory and legal obligations.



If we are unable to collect personal information we require, we may not be able to do business with you or the organisation with which you are connected.

### How does Toyota collect personal information?

Where possible, Toyota will collect your personal information directly from you. This may take place in a number of ways, such as when you give us a written order or ask us to provide a product or service over the telephone or internet.

Our Web site may also offer interactive facilities, such as customer enquiry or comment forms and competition entry forms, where personal information may be collected. In addition, we may obtain personal information from third parties such as our dealers and distributors, contractors and regulatory authorities.

Regardless of who provides personal information to us, it will always be handled by Toyota in accordance with this privacy policy and the National Privacy Principles.

Back to the top

### Do we disclose personal information to anyone else?

In providing you with a product or service, we may sometimes need to disclose your personal information to others. It is generally our policy not to disclose information to external organisations, however, examples of the types of organisations we may need to disclose information to in the course of providing a product or service are:

  * related bodies corporate
  * Toyota dealers
  * parts suppliers
  * insurers and financiers
  * a person outside Toyota who is contracted to us to provide a particular service on our behalf.



Some examples of the kinds of organisations with which we contract are

  * mailing houses for bulk mailing of letters and notices;
  * printers for marketing material;
  * information technology service providers; and
  * accountants, lawyers and other service providers.



Those contracted parties are not authorised by us to use personal information for anything other than the purpose for which we supplied that information to them. Some of our information technology service providers are located overseas and, as a result, personal information collected and held by Toyota may be transferred overseas.

Sometimes, the law requires us to disclose personal information. For example, information may be disclosed to a court in response to a subpoena or to a Government agency such as a vehicle licensing authority or the Australian Taxation Office.

We may also disclose personal information where the individual consents to us doing so. That consent may be written, verbal or implied from your conduct.

Back to the top

### Direct marketing

From time to time, we may use personal information to inform our customers about our products and services, or about special offers and promotions that we think may be of interest to you. We will generally give you the opportunity to express a wish not to receive direct marketing communications. You can let us know at any time if you no longer wish to receive marketing material (by contacting us by any of the means set out below) and we will remove your details from our direct marketing database.

Toyota does not disclose personal information to organisations outside Toyota and its related companies for the purposes of allowing them to direct market their products. However, we may join motor vehicle dealers and other business associates of Toyota in joint marketing of our respective products and services to customers.

If the law requires us to provide you with information about our products or services, we will provide that information even if you have elected not to receive information about our products and services generally.

Back to the top

### Ensuring personal information is up-to-date

We rely on the personal information we hold in conducting our business. Therefore, it is very important that the information we hold is accurate, complete and up-to-date.

We do everything we can to ensure that the personal information we hold is accurate complete and up-to-date whenever we collect or use it. This means that from time to time, we will ask you to tell us if there are any changes to your personal information. If you find that information we hold about you is incorrect, please contact us immediately and we will correct it.

Back to the top

### Security of personal information

Security of personal information is important to us and we take all reasonable precautions to protect personal information from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

Some of the ways we protect personal information include:

  * external and internal premises security;
  * restricting access to personal information only to staff who need it to perform their day to day functions;
  * maintaining technology products to prevent unauthorised computer access or damage to electronically stored information, such as requiring identifiers and passwords, firewalls and anti-virus software; and
  * maintaining physical security over paper records.



Back to the top

### Access to personal information by individuals

You can access most of the personal information we hold about you by contacting us by any of the means set out below.

We may charge an access fee to cover the reasonable cost of retrieving the information and supplying it to you.

Access to personal information may be refused in a number of circumstances, such as where the information relates to anticipated legal proceedings or the request for access is frivolous or vexatious. If we deny or restrict your access, we will explain why.

Toyota Finance collects the personal information it needs to provide the products and services it offers. Those products and services include various types of motor vehicle finance, warranties, insurance products and other financial services within Australia.

Toyota Finance also collects personal information about its customers and suppliers (including dealers), or employees or officers of its customers and suppliers, so that it can complete business transactions, purchase products and services, administer accounts, provide customer support, respond to customer inquiries and requests for product information and meet regulatory requirements.

If Toyota Finance is unable to collect personal information from or about an individual, it may not be able to do business with that individual or the organisation with which the individual is connected.

Where relevant, we will handle personal information about our current and former employees relying on the exemption in the Privacy Act relating to employee records.

### How does Toyota Finance collect personal information?

Where possible, Toyota Finance will collect personal information directly from the individual it relates to. This may take place in a number of ways, such as when an application for a product or service is completed or a product or service is requested over the telephone or internet.

We will also collect personal information during the course of our relationship with customers, for example where a loan is refinanced or the terms of an arrangement with us are varied.

Sometimes, personal information may be collected from a source other than the individual to which it relates. Some examples are:

  * where we obtain a credit report about an individual from a credit reporting agency in the course of assessing a loan application;
  * from an accountant where we approach the accountant in assessing a loan application;

  * a guarantor if a finance arrangement is guaranteed; and
  * parties outside Toyota Finance where that party is contracted to us to provide a particular service on our behalf and is bound by the same privacy rules we follow.



Some examples of the kinds of organisations contracted by Toyota Finance are:

  * mailing houses for bulk mailing of letters and notices;
  * printers for direct marketing material;
  * debt collection agencies; and

We will, with your help, keep your personal information accurate, complete and up-to-date. You have the right to access the personal information we hold about you, and to request amendments. If we're unable to meet your request for access, we will explain our reasons to you.

### How do we collect your personal information?

We collect your personal information in various ways, for example, over the phone, in one of our distributor's premises, in one of our offices or over the internet if you transact with us online.

Whenever possible, we collect your personal information from you. However, we may collect personal information about you from someone else. For example, if you apply for, receive or acquire a Toyota Insurance product or service via our intermediaries, (our distributors or other appointed representatives), our intermediaries may, (but only with your consent) obtain a credit report about you from a credit agency for the purposes of loan application assessment, or obtain financial details from your accountant.

Irrespective of the source, we'll respect, value and protect the privacy of your personal information.

Back to the top

### Why do we collect your personal information and how is it used?

We collect this information for purposes which include communicating with customers, setting premiums appropriately, assessing and paying claims, compiling statistics, providing products and services and, subject to your consent, for marketing purposes.

We will only provide your personal information to government authorities if required by law.

If necessary, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party (for example, Toyota Finance) when processing a claim, validating and confirming information, administering policies and where customer research is conducted by us or on our behalf.

Examples of third parties include other insurance companies, (to confirm your insurance profile), claims assessors, (when a claim requires assessment or investigation), the insurance reference bureau, consumer research organisations, a guarantor noted on a finance contract and finance companies (only if noted on your policy documents).

In order to keep you informed of special offers, including new products and services, we may share your personal information on a confidential basis with the Toyota Group of companies. If you do not wish to receive such information, you may contact us by calling **137 200**. You can elect to receive or cease receiving information at any time by simply calling that number.

There is no charge for making a request.

### When may a request for access to documents be denied?

  1. Confidential information provided by people or organisations other than you;
  2. Information that may lead to the identification of the person/s or organisation/s who provided the confidential information; or
  3. Commercially-sensitive information, which discloses our claims investigation procedures.
