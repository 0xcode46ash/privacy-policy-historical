Personal information identifies you and includes your name, mailing address, e-mail address, and phone number. We collect your personal information to provide you with services or information, as well as to give you a customized interactive experience and to help us develop new products and services to meet your needs.

We collect and use your personal information to provide you with services or information, as well as to give you a customized interactive experience and to help us develop new products and services to meet your needs. In addition, we collect and use your personal information to measure the effectiveness of our online advertising initiatives and determine the correlation between Toyota purchasers and the sites they visit.

_Promotional Programs:_ We may ask you to provide personal information to participate in promotional activities, such as sweepstakes, contests, games, special events, blogs and chats ("Programs"). Sometimes Programs are made available through the joint efforts of Toyota and an unaffiliated business partner. If you choose to participate, we may use the information you provide in connection with the Program. For example, we may send you e-mail messages related to the Program or your account activity, or for selection and notification of sweepstakes or contest winners.

Your personal information may also be shared with our business partner and may also be used by our business partner if you indicate your interest in receiving communications directly from that company. If you elect to receive communications from our business partner, your information will be used by that company in accordance with its policies, and this privacy statement will not apply to that company's use of your information. Sometimes the rules, terms and conditions or disclaimers that apply to a particular Program include information on how we may use the personal information that you provide to us through your participation in the Program. If there is a conflict between the rules, terms and conditions that apply to a particular Program and this Statement, those applying to the particular Program will govern. Please review all of the information about a Program before you provide us with any personal information.

Information About Phishing Scams

There have been noticeable increases in the number of suspicious e-mails claiming that the e-mail recipient has won a Toyota lottery or other promotion. Sometimes the e-mail claims that the recipient has won a new Toyota Prius. In order to claim the prize, the e-mail asks that personal information (i.e., Full Name, Address, Nationality, Age, Gender, Occupation, Phone/Fax, and/or Country of Residence) be sent to a Hotmail or Yahoo e-mail address. Samples of these hoax e-mails can be found at [this Web site](http://www.hoax-slayer.com/toyota-car-promotions-scam.shtml).

This type of e-mail solicitation is known commonly as a “phishing” scam, with the primary objective being to obtain one's personal information. This information can then be utilized to steal a person's identity. For example, a “Toyota Lottery” phishing scam is often sent from Chinese (.cn), German (.de) or British (.co.uk) addresses but can originate from anywhere and look very official even to the most savvy of Internet users. Toyota will never ask you to send passwords, login names, Social Security numbers, or other personal information through e-mail. If you receive an email from Toyota asking you to update your credit card information, do not respond: this phishing scam. Recipients of suspicious e-mail like this should delete the message from their in-box and, if possible, update their e-mail filter settings to block e-mails from the e-mail address being used. The [Federal Trade Commission](http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2008/04/vids.shtm) and the [Antiphishing Workgroup](http://www.antiphishing.org/) are also good sources of information about these types of security threats and how they may be reported to the authorities.
