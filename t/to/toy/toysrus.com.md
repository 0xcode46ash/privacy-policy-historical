The "R" Us Family may also use this information to analyze and manage its businesses. Aggregate data (which does not allow an individual to be identified, contacted or located) is collected from online and offline facilities and may be used to enhance the ability of the "R" Us Family members to communicate with you and for internal analysis and management purposes. 

From time to time you may receive periodic mailings, telephone calls or emails from "R" Us Family members with information on new products or services, discounts, special promotions, upcoming events or other offers from an "R" Us Family member or its marketing partners. You may opt out of receiving such communications from an Online Store by setting your communications preferences in the "Your Account" section of the Online Store or by calling 1-800-TOYSRUS and asking for an operator who will instruct you on how you may opt out of receiving online communications . You may also opt out of receiving such communications from an "R" Us Family member by calling 1-800-TOYSRUS (1-888-BABYRUS and/or 1-800-KIDSRUS) and asking for an operator. If at any time you want to update or change your information on the www.toysrusinc.com site, you can call 1-800-TOYSRUS and ask for an operator. If at any time you want to update or change your personal information on the other "R" Us Site (Giftsrus.com) you can adjust your communication preferences in the "Your Account" section of Giftsrus.com or you may call 1-877-GIFTSRUS and ask for an operator who will instruct you on how you may opt out of receiving online communications.

In addition, your personal information may be retained in the database for record keeping purposes and for internal research and analysis. 

_Sharing Your Personal Information_

"R" Us Family members will not license, sell or provide your personal information to any unaffiliated third party except as permitted by this policy or with your consent. The "R" Us Family shares your personal information as set forth below: 

**_With "R" Us Family Members._** Personal information collected by one member of the "R" Us Family will be used by that member in accordance with this policy and may be shared with other "R" Us Family members for use only in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

**_With Amazon.com at The Online Stores._** The Online Stores (www.toysrus.com, www.babiesrus.com, and www.imaginarium.com) all operate on the Amazon.com platform. When you provide information to an Online Store, Amazon.com initially collects this information. Amazon.com then provides the information to the appropriate "R" Us Family member. For example, Amazon.com collects information provided on the [www.toysrus.com](http://www.toysrus.com/) site and shares that information with Toysrus.com, an "R" Us Family member. Each "R" Us Family Member uses the information provided to it by Amazon.com in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. However, Amazon.com uses all information provided at an Online Store in accordance with its own privacy policy, and may engage in information gathering practices that are different from those conducted by members of the "R" Us Family and discussed in this policy. To learn more about how Amazon.com collects and uses your personal information and about your ability to access, update or direct how Amazon.com uses that information, visit the [Amazon.com Privacy Notice](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/misc/policy/privacy.html) or go to [www.amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/). 

**_With Our Service Providers._** "R" Us Family members may share your personal information with service providers who provide services for or administer activities on behalf of the "R" Us Family (such as, but not limited to, authorization of credit card and check transactions, order fulfillment, sweepstakes and contests, and co-branded or joint product and service promotions). The "R" Us Family may share your information with service providers who develop, host and maintain the website on behalf of a member or members of the "R" Us Family. The "R" Us Family may also share your information with service providers who warehouse product, personalize product and perform order fulfillment on behalf of a member or members of the "R" Us Family. These service providers are granted access to some or all of your personal information as necessary and may use cookies (as defined in Section 5 below) on our behalf, but are contractually restricted from using your personal information in any manner other than as may be necessary to perform their services. We may also utilize service providers to assist us in aggregating customer information. We may then share such aggregated information with prospective marketing partners and advertisers. 

**_In Connection with Business Transfers._** In the event that a store, division or part or all of an "R" Us Family member (or the assets of one of those entities) is bought or sold, customer information will likely be included among the transferred business assets. 

**_To Comply with Laws._ ** An "R" Us Family member may also disclose specific information when it determines that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law or to protect the interests or safety of its visitors and guests, the "R" Us Family or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organization for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 

**_On Registries and Wish Lists._** Registries and Wish Lists are made available for viewing by others. If you create your Registry or Wish List in a Retail Store, and elect to make it available Online, your information will be accessible at the Online Stores and shared with Amazon.com who may use such information in accordance with its own privacy policy. If you create your Registry or Wish List at the Online Stores, your registry information may also be accessible at the Retail Stores.

11.Special Notice Regarding Coremetrics 

  


****Special Notice**** (Effective Date of Privacy Policy: May 1, 2002)

**Coremetrics**. For a short period of time, a prior version of the Toysrus.com site ("TRU.com") had a trial arrangement with a service called Coremetrics to assist it in evaluating information about how visitors used the site. This trial arrangement is no longer in effect. As part of this service, cookies may have been placed on the computer systems of certain visitors to TRU.com by Coremetrics. Because neither the Online Stores nor the "R" Us Sites are currently using Coremetrics'services, visitors to these sites will not have Coremetrics cookies or cookies of any other third parties placed on their systems. However, even though Coremetrics' services are no longer being used, visitors to TRU.com during the period from approximately April 24, 2000 through August 2, 2000, may have Coremetrics cookies on their systems. If you have a Coremetrics cookie on your system (or would like to determine if you have a Coremetrics cookie on your system) and wish to remove the cookie from your system or opt out of the Coremetrics service, please go to: 

www.coremetrics.com/collected_eluminate.html. To find out more about Coremetrics' Privacy Policy, please go to: www.coremetrics.com/privacy.html.
