### Information about Phishing Scams

There have been noticeable increases in the number of suspicious e-mails claiming that the e-mail recipient has won a Toyota lottery or other promotion. Sometimes the e-mail claims that the recipient has won a new Toyota Prius. In order to claim the prize, the e-mail asks that personal information (i.e. Full Name, Address, Nationality, Age, Gender, Occupation, Phone/Fax, and/or Country of Residence) be sent to a Hotmail or Yahoo e-mail address. Samples of these hoax e-mails can be found at the following web site: http://www.hoax-slayer.com/toyota-car-promotions-scam.shtml. Note that these examples of the "phishing" hoax e-mails were not prepared by Toyota, all information and names contained in the hoax e-mails are fictitious, and any similarity to the names of actual people, including Toyota personnel, is entirely coincidental. This type of e-mail solicitation is known commonly as a "phishing" scam, with the primary objective being to obtain one's personal information. This information can then be utilized to steal a person's identity. For example, a "Toyota Lottery" phishing scam is often sent from Chinese (.cn), German (.de) or British (.co.uk) addresses but can originate from anywhere and look very official even to the most savvy of Internet users. Neither Toyota nor any other reputable business will ever ask you for personal information through an unsolicited e-mail. Recipients of suspicious e-mail like this should delete the message from their in-box and, if possible, update their e-mail filter settings to block e-mails from the e-mail address being used.
