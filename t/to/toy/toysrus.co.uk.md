# Privacy Policy and Cookies - Toys R Us - Britain's greatest toy store

[](http://www.toysrus.co.uk/info/legal/privacy.jsf#1)

At Toys R Us we are committed to protecting your privacy and we comply with the data protection laws applicable to the UK. This Privacy Policy outlines how your personal information is treated and forms part of our Terms and Conditions. (We may occasionally modify our Privacy Policy; when this happens we will notify you via our terms and conditions page).

## What information do we collect?

When you order we need to know your name, e-mail address, delivery address, credit/debit card number and expiry date. This allows us to process and fulfil your order and notify you of your order status. We also ask you for your telephone number(s) so that we can contact you easily if required. Additionally, we request that you confirm your date of birth, enabling us to control the sale of age restricted items, such as video games, through our website.

## How do we use your information?

Any personal data relating to you will be used and recorded by us in accordance with current data protection legislation and this Privacy Policy. We use the information collected from you to process orders and to provide a more personalised shopping experience. We may use your personal information to communicate with you, for record keeping purposes, and in aggregate (and therefore anonymously) for market research purposes, to track activity on our site, to publish trends and/or to improve usefulness and content.

We may use other companies to provide services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customers questions' about products or services, sending postal mail and e-mails, analysing data and processing credit card payments. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others unless you have consented to us making your name and address available to carefully vetted companies.

## In Addition

We would also like to send you offers for goods or services from our company or others from time to time which we think you may find of interest. If you do not wish to receive this information, do not tick the opt-in box on our checkout page before submitting your order.
