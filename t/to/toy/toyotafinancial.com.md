Toyota Motor Credit Corporation, Toyota Motor Insurance Services, Inc., and their subsidiaries (collectively, Toyota Financial Services, TFS, or we) respect your privacy and the confidential nature of the information that we gather during the course of our relationship with you. This Privacy Policy describes Toyota Financial Services' policy regarding information received about you during visits to our website. By using this website, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. We may change this Privacy Policy at any time without notice to you. 

Normal Website Usage

You can visit Toyota Financial Services' website to read product, investment, and company information, or use some of our online tools (e.g., What's Right for Me? and Payment Calculator) without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. During these types of visits, we collect and store statistical information on an anonymous basis, such as the information about the time and length of your visit, the website you last visited, the pages you request, and the date and time of those requests. We may also collect and store the name of your Internet Service Provider. 

We use cookies when you enter our website to help us gather this type of statistical information. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record keeping purposes so that we can track website and user activity. The use of cookies is an industry standard and you will find them at most websites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, if you do so, some parts of our website may not work properly for you.

We also use cookies to trigger certain online customer service surveys which could be hosted on a site other than this site. These surveys are completely anonymous and optional. The information TFS and any outside survey company obtains from you if you choose to fill out these surveys is used only to improve your experience in visiting the TFS website. 

Collection of Personally Identifiable Information

There are instances where we request personally identifiable information to provide our website visitors a service or correspondence (e.g., promotions and mailed brochures). This information, such as name, mailing address, e-mail address, or type of request, is collected and stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of the data and used to fulfill your request. The information may also be used by us and shared with other companies in the Toyota family and with our business partners (including Toyota dealers) in order to improve the services we provide you. We do not sell customer data, nor do we provide customer data to any non-dealer business partner for that company's independent use. 

If you choose to complete and submit our Online Credit Application, or to access My TFS Account, your personal information will be protected during transmission by an encryption process. Information gathered from the credit application process will not be shared except with the dealer you choose. We also may use this information to investigate your credit, employment, and income. 

If You Are a Customer of Toyota Financial Services

If you have a finance or lease account with us and access My TFS Account, you will need to enter certain identifying information such as account number, e-mail address, vehicle identification number, social security number, and zip code. We use this data to authenticate your Toyota Financial Services account. Information gathered on My TFS Account, or during the course of our relationship with you, may also be used as detailed in the Financial Privacy Notice mailed to you. If you are a TFS insurance customer, information gathered during the course of our relationship with you may be used as detailed in the Insurance Privacy Notice mailed to you. You may request a copy of your Financial Privacy Notice (if applicable) by calling us at 1-800-874-8822. You may request a copy of your Insurance Privacy Notice (if applicable) by calling us at 1-800-228-8559.
