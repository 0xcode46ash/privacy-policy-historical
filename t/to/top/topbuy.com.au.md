This may occur in circumstances where:

TopBuy Australia must be satisfied of the legitimacy of any request for personal information of an individual or by another person who is authorised to make the request on the individual’s behalf such as a legal guardian or authorised agent. Anonymous requests for personal information may make it difficult to establish the legitimacy of the request. It may be practicable to use a pseudonym in the request if you have transacted with us previously under the same pseudonym. In such cases the minimum amount of information to establish you identity will be sought.

**  
Refusal to Give Access**
