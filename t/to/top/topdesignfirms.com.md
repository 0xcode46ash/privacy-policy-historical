**Security**

This Web site takes every precaution to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the Web site, your information is protected both online and off-line.

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information off line. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desks. When they return, they must re-enter their password to regain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up to date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.

If you have any questions about the security at our Web site, please send an e-mail through our [ contact page](https://web.archive.org/web/20031203232837id_/http%3A//topdesignfirms.com/site-contactus.php).

**Legal Disclaimer**

Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to a court order or comply with a legal process served on our Web site. We will provide prior notification of such request(s) either by e-mail or written notice.

**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our homepage so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you by e-mail. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. You can choose not to have your information used.
