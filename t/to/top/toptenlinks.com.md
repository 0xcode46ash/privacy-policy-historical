Aggregate

Cookies

Cookies are pieces of information that we store in your computer. Temporary cookies only last as long as your browser is running. Persistent cookies are stored on your hard disk (they take up very little space). We use cookies exclusively for advertising purposes.

IP Address

When you are connected to the Internet, your computer has a unique Internet ID called an IP Address. Most people that connect through a dial-up service, such as America Online, get a different IP Address each time they login. Others might have a permanently assigned IP Address, called a static IP Address. It is difficult or impossible for a web site to collect personal information about you  
(i.e., your name, email address, etc.) from your IP Address alone.

Browser Types

By tracking what browser types are accessing are site, we can make sure that our pages are displayed properly to our visitors. Browser Version

Browser version is a number the browser developers assign to their software programs in order to keep track of different versions of their browsers. For example Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 or Netscape Navigator 4.5.
