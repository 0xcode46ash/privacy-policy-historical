TopTenREVIEWS™ and its network of related review sites take your privacy seriously. Our privacy policy is designed to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of the information we collect. We encourage you to read our full privacy policy, below: 

**Information Collected** TopTenREVIEWS does not collect any _personally identifiable information_ about individuals, except when such information is voluntarily submitted by the user.

In common with many websites, TopTenREVIEWS automatically logs certain _non-personally identifiable information_ about visits to our websites. This information is used for system administration and for producing usage statistics.

We do collect email addresses from individuals that wish to take advantage of special promotional offers, but ** _we do not sell, rent or disclose collected email addresses to third parties._**

**Electronic Newsletters and Site Notification** As a service, we offer free, electronic newsletters and new site (or site update) notifications to our users. TopTenREVIEWS gathers the email addresses from users who voluntarily subscribe for these services. eMail addresses collected are used for newsletter and site notification purposes only.

Newsletters and website notifications can be subscribed to at any time by accessing our _Review Notification Signup,_ located on the TopTenREVIEWS homepage and any of our review sites.

Consumers may remove themselves from any mailing list by following the instructions contained at the end of every newsletter or website notification email.

**Cookies** As you browse TopTenREVIEWS sites, we place “cookies” on your hard drive to show which source (search engine and keywords, newsletter or site notification, pay-per-click ad and so on) you used to find our site. We also use cookies when you press the buy button to collect aggregate data for analysis. We do not use cookies to track single-user data.

**Opt-Out Policy** TopTenREVIEWS gives users options to opt out wherever practical; such choices include:

• Opting not to receive our electronic newsletters when registering for a site  
• Opting not to receive review site notifications

**Unsubscribe Policy** Users may unsubscribe from any of our electronic newsletters or site notifications at any time by following the instructions contained at the end of each newsletter or notification.

USE OF COLLECTED INFORMATION

All personally identifiable information provided to TopTenREVIEWS is maintained by and accessible only to TopTenREVIEWS, unless stated otherwise in this privacy policy.

**Third Party Partners** TopTenREVIEWS has teamed up with reputable third party vendors in order to provide certain services to its online users. When leaving our website to view one of our partner websites, we encourage users to review the privacy statements of those websites as we cannot guarantee the privacy of users while visiting affiliate sites.
