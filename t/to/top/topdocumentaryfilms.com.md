# Privacy Policy - Top Documentary Films

This page discloses the information about how we and our partners gather and disseminate your data when you visit [https://topdocumentaryfilms.com](https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/).

When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form (name and email address), the visitor's IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection. An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/) service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available [here](https://automattic.com/privacy/). After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue. If you have left comments, you can [request](https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/contact/) to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also [request](https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/contact/) that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

Additionally, when submitting your comment, you may opt-in to saving your name and email address in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for 72 hours after which they will automatically expire, meaning after 72 hours you'll need to manually fill your details again if you want to leave further comments.

2\. Ratings:

Documentaries on this site can be rated. When you rate a documentary this site will record an anonymized string (also called a hash) created from your IP address and your Host/Internet Service Provider (ISP). Also, this site will place a recognizable cookie on your computer. We record this particular data so you're unable to rate the same documentary multiple times. This data is not tied to any personally identifiable information of yours.

We purge these logs every two years, meaning their retention on this site could be up to maximum of two years, depending on when you've performed a rating relative to our purge date. The next rating data purge will be performed on 12/30/2020.

9\. Affiliate links:

We are a participant in the [Amazon Associates Program](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/), an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.
