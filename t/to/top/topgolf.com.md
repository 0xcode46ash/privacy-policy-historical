# TopGolf offer a fun leisure experience for all the family, for people of all ages and abilities who enjoy a game of golf.

TopGolf are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors; this policy sets out how we will treat your personal information.

**(1) What information do we collect?**

We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal data:

  * information about your computer and about your visits to and use of this website, such as your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit and number of page views;
  * information that you provide to us for the purpose of registering with us (including Executive Members Online Booking);
  * information that you provide to us for the purpose of subscribing to our website services, email notifications and/or newsletters (including subscription to our e-newsletter);
  * any other information that you choose to send to us.



( **2) Cookies**

We use cookies on this website. A cookie is a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The text file is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser. 

We may send a cookie, which may be stored on by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. We may use the information we obtain from the cookie in the administration of this website, to improve the website’s usability and for marketing purposes.

Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. (For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector.) This will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites. 

**(3) Using your personal data**

Personal data submitted on this website will be used for the purposes specified in this privacy policy or in relevant parts of the website.

We may use your personal information to:

  * administer the website;
  * improve your browsing experience by personalising the website;
  * enable your use of the services available on the website;[ click here for our feedback form](https://web.archive.org/web/20081219170316id_/http%3A//www.topgolf.co.uk/enquiry_form.php)
  * send you email notifications which you have specifically requested;
  * send to you our newsletter and other TopGolf marketing communications which we think may be of interest to you by post or, where you have specifically agreed to this, by email or similar technology (you can inform us at any time if you no longer require marketing communications to be sent by emailing us at [EMAIL])
  * provide third parties with statistical information about our users – but this information will not be used to identify any individual user;
  * deal with enquiries and complaints made by or about you relating to the website.



We will not without your express consent provide your personal information to any third parties for the purpose of direct marketing. 

**(4) Other disclosures**

In addition to the disclosures reasonably necessary for the purposes identified elsewhere in this privacy policy, we may disclose information about you: 

  * to the extent that we are required to do so by law;
  * in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings;
  * in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (including providing information to others for the purposes of fraud prevention and reducing credit risk); 



Except as provided in this privacy policy, we will not provide your information to third parties. 

**(6) Security of your personal data**

We will take reasonable technical and organisational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information. 

Of course, data transmission over the internet is inherently insecure, and we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the internet.

**(7) Policy amendments**

We may update this privacy policy from time-to-time by posting a new version on our website. You should check this page occasionally to ensure you are happy with any changes. 

**(8) Your rights**

You may instruct us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes by email (to [EMAIL]) at any time. (In practice, you will usually either expressly agree in advance to our use of your personal data for marketing purposes, or we will provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of the use of your personal data for marketing purposes.)
