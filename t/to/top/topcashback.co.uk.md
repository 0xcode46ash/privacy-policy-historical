We only hold information in order to allow users to log into and run their accounts. We will also keep accounts updated with commission levels. Registered users may update their account details online by following the relevant links from within their account page.

Member nicknames & basic related statistics may occassionally be exposed. A members balance where the member was referred to TopCashBack and is under the referral threshold amount (currently £5) may be visible to the referring member. If you were referred to TopCashBack, this fact will be made clear in your account details page,  from which you may opt out of them being able to see your account balance. Where selected (default), account balances are only displayed until you reach the referral threshold (currently £5). Once this is reached your account balance will no longer be visible.
