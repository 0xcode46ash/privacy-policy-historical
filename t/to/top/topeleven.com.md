### 6\. PROTECTION OF MINORS

6.1. The Services provided by Nordeus (including the game Top Eleven) may only be played by a person over the age of 16 or a person between the age of 13 and 16 where that person’s parent or guardian has reviewed and consents to the Terms and this Policy on their behalf. Any person who provides Information to Nordeus through any part of the Services represents to Nordeus that they are 16 years of age or older or that they are between 13 years of age and 16 years of age and their parent or guardian has reviewed the Terms and this Policy and has consented on their behalf. 

### 7\. SAFETY MEASURES TO PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION

7.1. Data encryption: To protect Your Information during communication with Your web browser, We encrypt transmissions of that Information using secure socket layer technology.

7.2. Further technical security measures: In order to prevent illegal manipulation by third parties and to identify and prevent any form of misuse, We record the IP addresses of all computers used to access the line-up on the Services. In addition, all Your Information are protected from unauthorised access by a firewall (a computer that is fitted with complex security technology specifically designed to shield Our network from the internet). Additionally, We use reliable internal data protection mechanisms combined with a restrictive security system. However, no website or internet transmission is completely secure, and We cannot guarantee that unauthorised access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We thus urge You to take steps to keep Your Information safe, and to log out of your platform account after use. If your platform account is hacked, this may lead to unauthorised use of the Services, so be careful to keep your account information secure.

7.3. Although We strive to protect Your Information, We cannot guarantee the security of Your Information while it is being transmitted to Us; any transmission is at Your own risk. Once We have received Your Information, We have procedures and security features in place to try to prevent unauthorised access.

### 8\. DISCLAIMER

8.1. You expressly agree that the Services are provided on an “as is” basis without warranties of any kind. We are not responsible for events beyond Our direct control. Because of the complex and constantly changing nature of Our technology and business, We cannot guarantee, nor do We represent, that there will be an error-free performance regarding the privacy of Your Information, and We will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to the use or release of Your Information.

8.2. We cannot ensure the protection of any Information that You provide to a third party websites that links to or from the Services, since these third party websites are owned and operated independently of Us. Any Information collected by these third parties is not governed by this Privacy Policy but by the privacy policy, if any, of such third party.

Nevertheless, We take steps to ensure that Our agents, affiliates and suppliers comply with Our standards of privacy regardless of their location.

### 10\. MERGERS AND OTHER EVENTS REQUIRING TRANSFER

10.1. If We should ever file for bankruptcy, or become insolvent, or be acquired by a third party, merge with a third party, sell all or part of Our assets, or transfer substantially all or part of Our relevant assets to a third party, We are entitled to share Your Information You have provided through the Services to potential and subsequent business and merger partners.
