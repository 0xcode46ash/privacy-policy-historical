Privacy is important to TopResume. If you have any questions or if you believe that TopResume has not adhered to this privacy policy, please send us a note at [contact@topresume.com](mailto:contact@topresume.com).

## Privacy Policy

**1\. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS**

Talent Worldwide Inc., d/b/a TopResume ("TopResume") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy sets forth our current privacy practices with regard to the information we collect when you or your computer interact with our website. By accessing www.TopResume.com, you acknowledge and fully understand TopResume’s Privacy Policy and freely consent to the information collection and use practices described in this Website Privacy Policy.

**2\. PARTICIPATING MERCHANT POLICIES**

Related services and offerings with links from this website, including vendor sites, have their own privacy policies that can be viewed by clicking on the corresponding links within each respective website. Online merchants and others who participate in TopResume services are encouraged to participate in industry privacy initiatives and to take a responsible attitude towards consumer privacy. However, since we do not have direct control over the policies or practices of participating merchants and other third parties, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or contents of those sites. We recommend and encourage that you always review the privacy policies of merchants and other third parties before you provide any personal information or complete any transaction with such parties.

**3\. INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT**

TopResume collects certain information from and about its users three ways: directly from our Web Server logs, from any browsing information, including Cookies, and from the user, including in response to surveys and questionnaires and content voluntarily shared in resumes and in forums.

**a. Web Server Logs**

When you visit our Website, we may track information to administer the site and analyze its usage. Examples of information we may track include:

  * Your Internet protocol address.
  * The kind of browser or computer you use.
  * Number of links you click within the site.
  * State or country from which you accessed the site.
  * Date and time of your visit.
  * Name of your Internet service provider.
  * Web page you linked to our site from.
  * Pages you viewed on the site.



**b. Use of Cookies**

TopResume may use cookies to personalize or enhance your user experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web Server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases site navigation by providing and saving your preferences and login information as well as providing personalized functionality.

TopResume reserves the right to share aggregated site statistics with partner companies, but does not allow other companies to place cookies on our website unless there is a temporary, overriding customer value (such as merging into www.TopResume.com a site that relies on third-party cookies).

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you reject cookies by changing your browser settings then be aware that this may disable some of the functionality on our Website.

**c. Personal Information of Users**

Visitors to our website may be permitted to register to purchase services. When you register, we will request some personal information such as name, address, email, telephone number or facsimile number, account number and other relevant information. If you are purchasing a service, we may request financial information. Any financial information we collect is used only to bill you for the services you purchased. If you purchase by credit card, this information may be forwarded to your credit card provider. We do not store any credit card information. For other types of registrations, we will ask for the relevant information. You may also be asked to disclose personal information to us so that we can provide assistance and information to you. For example, such data may be warranted in order to provide online technical support and troubleshooting. We will also collect such additional personal information as you choose to share with us, such as, content included on your resume or provided to us for use in writing or editing your resume, photos or other content you may post, including, as you may elect to post, social media handles, links to Facebook groups or Google Groups, and other social platforms ("Posted Content"). We may also collect any information provided to us by partners, such as expected salary or industry. We may also match information provided to us by third parties with personally identifiable information in order to validate certain aspects of that information.

We will not disclose personally identifiable information (other than Posted Content, which you agree to make public by posting) we collect from you to third parties without your permission except to the extent necessary including:

  * To fulfill your service requests for products or services, such as providing writers with access to resumes and personal information provided by you. 
  * To protect ourselves, our customer or our vendors from liability or to defend our rights, including investigations of fraud or misconduct.
  * To third parties who have agreed in writing to maintain such information in confidence and use such information solely in performance of services to us. 
  * To respond to legal process or comply with law, including subpoenas.
  * To entities under common ownership or control with us or to our owners. 
  * To third parties for purposes of research or analysis or to market goods or services to you (unless you have opted-out under Section 11).
  * In connection with a merger, acquisition, or liquidation of the company. 
  * If you purchase a product or service that is sponsored for a group of users, including, for example, your employer, we may share the fact of your participation with the group sponsor.
  * If you purchase or view a critique, we may share your name and email with the partner.



We may provide either resumes submitted to us or revised by us to partners. We may also share information with third parties in order to develop and provide services that may be useful to you.

**4\. USE OF WEB BEACONS OR GIF FILES**

TopResume Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons – sometimes also called single-pixel gifs – that allow TopResume to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. TopResume may include Web beacons in promotional email messages or newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.

Some of these Web beacons may be placed by third party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or email communications. These Web beacons may be used by these service providers to place a persistent cookie on your computer. This allows the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or emails and compile anonymous information in relation to those page views, which in turn enables us and our service providers to learn which advertisements and emails bring you to our website and how you use the site. TopResume prohibits Web beacons from being used to collect or access your personal information.

**5\. ACCESSING WEB ACCOUNT INFORMATION**

We will provide you with the means to ensure that personally identifiable information in your web account file is correct and current. You may review this information by contacting us by sending an email to our support attendant – [contact@topresume.com](mailto:contact@topresume.com).

**6\. DO NOT TRACK**

We have not implemented any technology that would effectively recognize do not track signals and note that some content available on our Site is made available through relationships with third party providers who we do not control and who may collect and/or disclose personally identifiable information.

**8\. HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION**

We use commercially reasonable procedures that are designed to protect the personal information in our custody and control that we collect from you against loss, theft and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. We have developed and implemented and continue to maintain and monitor a written information security program applicable to all records containing personal information. This security program is appropriate to the size, scope and type of our business, the resources available to us, the amount of stored data and the need for security and confidentiality of the personal information we store. No security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases or the security during transmission to us of the information you supply over the Internet. You can help us by taking precautions to protect your personal information when you are on the Internet and only disclose information that you want made public. Change your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers and make sure to use a secure web browser.

For the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, personal information may be transferred to, processed, stored and accessed by us, our affiliates and third parties in the United States and in other jurisdictions where we or they operate. Courts and other authorities in these jurisdictions may, in certain circumstances, be entitled to access your personal information. By using the Website, you consent to this transfer, processing, storage and access of your personal information in and/or outside of the jurisdiction in which you reside.

**9\. AGGREGATE DATA**

We may share and publicize aggregate and/or de-identified information shared with third parties and the public.

**10\. CHILDREN UNDER 13**

We do not specifically market to or knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 for marketing purposes. Because some information is collected online, it may not appear to be the personal information of a child under 13. If a child under 13 submits personal information to us and we learn that the personal information is the information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible. If you are under 13, please do not register for any of our services or provide us any information about yourself (such as your name, email address or phone number).

**11\. OPTING OUT OF MARKETING**

TopResume will provide the right to request and receive, once a year and free of charge, information about third parties to whom we have disclosed certain types of personal information (if any) about you for our direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, and a description of the categories of personal information shared. To make such a request, please send an email to [contact@topresume.com](mailto:contact@topresume.com) and please include the phrase "Personal Information Privacy Request" in the subject line, the domain name of the website you are inquiring about, along with your name, address and email address. At our option, we may respond to such requests by providing instructions about how our users can exercise their options to prevent our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

This Privacy Policy identifies the categories of "Personally Identifiable Information" (as defined below) that we collect through our website about individual consumers who use or visit our website and the categories of third-party persons or entities with whom such personally identifiable information may be shared.

Depending on the visitor’s activity at our website, certain Personally Identifiable Information may be collected, in addition to information set forth in other sections of this document.
