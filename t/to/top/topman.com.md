For your convenience, customers in the UK and Republic of Ireland can go to their nearest store to return an item, excluding those in department stores. Please ensure that you take your despatch note with you as your proof of purchase. You will also require the card that was used to purchase the order online. If you are not the cardholder for the order, they will need to be present at the time of return to store to accept the refund back onto their credit/debit card.

Republic of Ireland customers - Please note: refunds in-store for items bought on-line will be paid in Euros by applying Arcadia's current commercial exchange rate to the sterling price for the item on your despatch note.

International customers - Please note: unfortunately we currently do not offer refunds or exchanges on items bought on our website to stores outside of the UK and Republic of Ireland. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause you

You can return an item by post within 14 days of receipt. Customers in the UK will receive a freepost returns label with their order. International customers and customers from EIRE will not receive a freepost returns label and are required to return unwanted orders at their own cost.

Please see **How do I return an item by post?** in the [Returns section](http://help.topman.com/system/templates/selfservice/topman/#!portal/1005/topic/1537/Returns-Online) of our FAQs for information on how to make a return by post.

Returns by post cannot be accepted without a valid Returns Authorisation Number. You will be unable to get a Returns Authorisation code online if more than 14 days has passed since you received the items. See 'How do I return an item by post?' in the Returns section of our FAQs for further information on how to obtain a Returns Authorisation Number.

Please allow 28 days from the day the parcel is posted for your refund to be processed. The refund will be processed once your goods are received into our warehouse. We will email you to let you know once your parcel has been received and your refund has been processed.

  
Please note that it may take 2-3 working days for the refund to show in your account. Each item returned is refunded separately, and will show on your statement as a refund / credit from Topman. If a debit/credit card that was used to purchase the items expires before we process your refund please contact our **[Customer Services Team](http://help.topman.com/system/templates/selfservice/topman/#!portal/1005/topic/1543/Contact) **with your order number, postcode and new card details.

**RETURNING GOODS BOUGHT AS SPECIAL OFFERS**  
If you return a single item bought as part of a multi-buy discount offer (for example 'buy 2 for £20.00') you will be refunded the full price of that item less the total discount given in the offer. If you return all items purchased with the multi-buy discount you will be refunded with the full multi-buy value.

For combination purchases ("buy one, get one free" or "get the lowest priced item free"), you must return any free items or vouchers back for us to process a refund.

**RETURNING GOODS WHICH ARE OF UNSATISFACTORY QUALITY OR UNFIT FOR PURPOSE**

Customers in the UK and EIRE can return these items to us using the freepost returns label enclosed with their order or download a freepost returns label here.

Topman is committed to reducing the impacts of its packaging on the environment. Our aim is to reduce our production of packaging waste, maximise recycling and reduce disposal to landfill as far as reasonably possible. We take our environmental responsibilities very seriously and aim to continually reduce the impacts of our waste on the environment. We are a registered business under the UK’s Packaging Regulations and contribute toward the recycling of packaging waste arising in the UK. Where possible, we will encourage our customers to recycle their own waste. For further information on how you can help to recycle more and where you can recycle your waste, please visit www.recyclenow.com. 

**WEEE COMPLIANCE**

So that you can get your old electrical products recycled, Arcadia have contributed toward the development of recycling collection points (known as ‘Designated Collection Facilities) throughout the UK through our membership of the Distributor Take Back Scheme (DTS).

To remind you to recycle, all new electrical products are marked with a crossed out wheeled bin symbol.

UK households dispose of over 1.2 million tonnes of electrical and electronic waste every year. This is the equivalent of 150,000 double decker buses and would be enough to fill the new Wembley Stadium 6 times over. Much of the UK's electronic waste ends up in landfill sites, where toxins put communities at risk.

To remind you to recycle, all new electrical products are marked with a crossed out wheeled bin symbol.

Not all council sites are suitable to collect all types of waste electrical goods. To find out your nearest participating site and for advice on all aspects of recycling at home, please visit [www.recycle-more.co.uk](http://www.recycle-more.co.uk/)

Please remember to have your postcode to hand.
