UK Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Regulations (SI 2006 No. 3289)

So that you can get your old electrical products recycled, Arcadia have contributed toward the development of recycling collection points (known as ‘Designated Collection Facilities) throughout the UK through our membership of the Distributor Take Back Scheme (DTS).

UK households dispose of over 1.2 million tonnes of electrical and electronic waste every year. This is the equivalent of 150,000 double decker buses and would be enough to fill the new Wembley Stadium 6 times over. Much of the UK's electronic waste ends up in landfill sites, where toxins put communities at risk.

To remind you to recycle, all new electrical products are marked with a crossed out wheeled bin symbol.

Not all council sites are suitable to collect all types of waste electrical goods. To find out your nearest participating site and for advice on all aspects of recycling at home, please visit [www.recycle-more.co.uk](http://www.recycle-more.co.uk/)

Please remember to have your postcode to hand.
