**NEXT DAY DELIVERY**

If you have placed an order for nominated day delivery this will be delivered by our partner courier company Yodel.

We aim to deliver all mainland UK nominated day orders on the day you specify. Next working day delivery is available for orders placed before 7pm Monday - Friday, or before 2pm on Sunday (GMT/BST).

Deliveries to Northern Ireland, the Highlands and Islands and AB postcodes will take longer to arrive and will not arrive on your nominated day. Deliveries to these areas will arrive within seven working days after the date nominated at the checkout. If you decide to have your parcel delivered to an alternative address, we may be able to change it provided the new address is within the same local area as the original address, although this service is not guaranteed.

If you select a nominated day delivery and include your mobile telephone number at the checkout, you will be notified on the day of delivery via a text message that your parcel will be delivered that day. You will also receive an email.

If you are not in when the courier initially tries to deliver your parcel and they cannot find a safe location to leave the package, they will leave a card explaining that there was an unsuccessful attempt to deliver the parcel. The courier will leave a mobile phone number on the card so that you can arrange another delivery attempt, or arrange to collect your parcel from your local Yodel depot. To use this option, contact Yodel via its online tracking system or automated call system. Details of both can be found on Yodel’s website <http://www.myyodel.co.uk/>. You are required to give Yodel at least 24 hours advance warning if using this facility, so that your parcel can be readied for collection.  Opening times of your local Yodel service centre can be found on the delivery card that the courier will leave after an unsuccessful delivery attempt.

Please note that for security reasons, you will need to present two forms of identification when collecting your parcel, one of each of the following:

1\. Photographic (e.g. passport, driving licence)

2\. Utility bill or similar, including name and address.

**FREE DELIVERY** Get free delivery on your UK order if you've spent over £50 with code FREE50UK. Enter at checkout to redeem.

COLLECT FROM STORE

You can now order products on our website and collect them from a Topman or Outfit* store, along with other convenient Topshop pick-up locations, instead of having them sent to your home.

This service is available at mainland UK stores but excludes Channel Islands, Isle of Man, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland as well as some areas of the Highlands.

HOW IT WORKS

**1\. Choose your store**

Use the store finder within the checkout to find your nearest participating store.  
We offer two collect from store options: Standard Delivery (Free) and Express Delivery (£3).

Collect from Store Standard Delivery* - If you select this option, we will aim to deliver your order between 3 and 7 days from the date you placed it.   However, sometimes during sale periods or other busy periods deliveries might take longer.  Your estimated delivery date will be indicated on the storefinder page within the checkout.

**3\. Collect from store**

Come into store to collect your order, bringing your confirmation email and the card that you paid with. If you have paid by Paypal please bring the card that links to your Paypal account.

If the order is not collected within the 10 days, we will assume it is unwanted, cancel the order and issue a refund to your original payment method.

  * Credit Card Validation
  * Visa and Mastercard Securecode
  * PAYPAL



All credit/debit cardholders are subject to validation checks and authorisation by the card issuer. If the issuer of your payment card refuses to, or does not for any reason, authorise payment then you will be notified of this immediately at the check-out stage.  
In assessing your request for goods or services, we may use your information for the purposes of the prevention and detection of fraud. One of the purposes for which we may disclose your address and postcode details is to check against the IMRG Security Alert or any other Fraud Prevention Scheme. At all times where we disclose your information it will remain secure. If you believe your details are incorrect you may correct those details by following the procedure set out in our privacy policy. (View the **[privacy policy](http://www.topman.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CatalogNavigationSearchResultCmd?catalogId=33056&storeId=12555&langId=-1&viewAllFlag=false&categoryId=278567&interstitial=true#fragment-9)** ).

**Verified by Visa and Mastercard Securecode - Online Shopping Mage Safe**

Topman.com is working together with Visa and MasterCard to offer you a safer shopping experience when using your credit card online.

[Verified by Visa](http://www.visaeurope.com/en/visa_europe.aspx) and [MasterCard SecureCode](http://www.mastercard.com/uk/personal/en/cardholderservices/securecode/index.html) follow the same principles as Chip and Pin, by helping to protect your card against unauthorised use when you shop via the Internet.

If your bank or card issuer is already a part of this scheme, then you might have already noticed the Verified by Visa or MasterCard SecureCode page appear when you last made a purchase with a participating retailer on the Internet.

If your bank is yet to introduce this security measure then the following information will explain how it works and the added protection benefits of registering.

**Online Protection Benefits**

  * Shop online with added security and peace of mind.
  * Your personal password is linked to your card only, and not to your computer.
  * This security scheme will help to prevent unauthorised purchases.



**How it works**

When you reach the checkout process at Topman.com (or any participating retailer) you will have the opportunity to register for either Verified by Visa or MasterCard SecureCode. Simply sign-up for the service following the online instructions that are linked directly to your card issuer, set up your new personal password once your card issuer has confirmed your identity, and continue shopping.

This is a one-off registration process, so you will be able to use the same password for all future purchases you make with participating retailers.

Alternatively you can contact your bank directly to register, or visit [Verified by Visa](http://www.visaeurope.com/en/visa_europe.aspx) or [MasterCard SecureCode](http://www.mastercard.com/uk/personal/en/cardholderservices/securecode/index.html) for more information.

Please note: If you choose not to register during the checkout process, depending on your card issuer, we may not be able to process your order. A different method of payment will be required to complete your purchase.

You can now access your Paypal account with Topman.com for quick, easy and safe purchasing.

We have made every effort to display as accurately as possible the colours of our products that appear on the website. However, as the actual colours you see will depend on your monitor, we cannot guarantee that your monitor's display of any colour will accurately reflect the colour of the product on delivery.

All sizes and measurements are approximate, however we do make every effort to ensure they are as accurate as possible. Unless otherwise stated, sizes indicated are UK sizes. Please refer to the size guide for clarification.

We will take all reasonable care to ensure that all details, descriptions and prices of products appearing on the website are correct at the time when the relevant information was entered onto the system. We reserve the right to refuse orders where product information has been mis-published, including prices and promotions.

**WEEE COMPLIANCE**

So that you can get your old electrical products recycled, Arcadia have contributed toward the development of recycling collection points (known as ‘Designated Collection Facilities) throughout the UK through our membership of the Distributor Take Back Scheme (DTS).

UK households dispose of over 1.2 million tonnes of electrical and electronic waste every year. This is the equivalent of 150,000 double decker buses and would be enough to fill the new Wembley Stadium 6 times over. Much of the UK's electronic waste ends up in landfill sites, where toxins put communities at risk.

To remind you to recycle, all new electrical products are marked with a crossed out wheeled bin symbol.

Not all council sites are suitable to collect all types of waste electrical goods. To find out your nearest participating site and for advice on all aspects of recycling at home, please visit [www.recycle-more.co.uk](http://www.recycle-more.co.uk/)

Please remember to have your postcode to hand.

**PAYING WITH GIFT CARDS ONLINE**

It's easy to pay with a gift card online. Just click on 'add a gift card' in the payment section and enter your gift card PIN number and security code, which can be found on the back of your card.

Up to five gift cards can be used on one order. You can also split payment between a gift card and another payment source (eg. Visa Debit or Paypal) - we will calculate the remaining balance for you once you have entered your gift card PIN number and security code, so all you need to do is fill in your card or Paypal details as usual.

However, please note that if you have enough funds on your gift card to cover your total order cost including delivery, you will not be able to use split payment.

**RETURNS WHEN PAYING WITH GIFT CARDS ONLINE**

Always remember to hold on to your gift card when you order in case you need to make a return, as the money will automatically be refunded to the same card. If you have lost or discarded your card and wish to make a return, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ContactUs?catalogId=33056&storeId=12555&krypto=bw2BpuZQvDIRSMcapRzCKajkkhzzMsKHg%2Fzdb6gCzzE%3D) to contact our customer services.

Orders paid for using split payment (part gift card, part card or Paypal) will always refund the gift card first. Any remaining balance will be paid back to the card or Paypal account used. This excludes delivery costs, which are non-refundable.

**WHERE CAN I USED MY GIFT CARD?**

Your Gift Card can be used online or in any store (Burton, Dorothy Perkins, Evans, Miss Selfridge, Outfit, Topshop, Topman and Wallis in the UK) excluding those within department stores. For full details, please click here to review our terms and conditions.

**CAN I USE MORE THAN ONE GIFT CARD AS A METHOD OF PAYMENT**

Yes, you can use up to 5 Gift Cards in any one transaction. Please retain the original gift card(s) when completing an order online as this may be required at a later date if you return your purchases.

When using gift cards in conjunction with other payment methods, the full value of the Gift Card will be taken first, and any remaining balance will be charged to your additional payment method.

**HOW WILL I BE REFUNDED IF I'VE PAID WITH A GIFT CARD AND CREDIT/DEBIT CARD**

The Gift Card will be credited first, with the remaining balance being credited to the debit/credit card used at the time of purchase.
