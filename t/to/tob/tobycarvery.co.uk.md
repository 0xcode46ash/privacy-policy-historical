# Privacy

##  Personal information 

We only collect personal information on a voluntary basis. If you choose to join Toby Carvery's "Stay in Touch" service, all that we require are a few simple contact details. We promise to:

  * Only contact you by the method you have selected - by email or by email and mobile text.
  * To never pass on your details to any other company without your expressed permission and then it would only be to provide you with an added benefit.
  * To always allow you to opt-out and unsubscribe at any time. Each communication from us provides a simple and immediate opt-out option.



You must be aged 18 or over and it is for this reason that we ask for confirmation of date of birth at the point of registering.

Please note that you do not have to register or opt-in to this service to use our website.

If you have any questions about our privacy promise please use our [customer feedback form](http://www.guestfeedback.co.uk/nationalsearch/tobycarvery/) and one of our team will get back to you.
