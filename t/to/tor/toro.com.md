The Toro Company respects your privacy. We provide this Privacy Policy so you know about our online information practices and understand how we treat the information we receive about you from your use of this website (the "Site") and any mobile application of ours (each, an “App”) (collectively, the "Service"). This Policy applies, in general, to all Internet sites and mobile applications operated by or on behalf of The Toro Company and our affiliates and business units worldwide (collectively, "Toro"). 

Please read this Privacy Policy. By using or visiting the Service, or downloading, registering or using an App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions of Use (the “Terms”). Use of this Service is voluntary. If you do not agree to the Privacy Policy and the Terms, you must immediately cease such use. 

### The Personal Information Toro Collects

There are a few places where Toro gives you an opportunity to voluntarily provide Toro with your personal information. This refers to information that lets Toro know the specifics of who you are, and may include, without limitation, your first and last name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, credit card number, and other personally identifying information. When you engage in certain activities on the Service, such as ordering a product or service; filling out a form to request a demo, entering a contest or sweepstakes; participating in third-party social network service activities whether through the Service or third-party social network services; filling out a survey; sending feedback or product reviews; requesting owners and parts manuals; or registering your product online, Toro may ask you to provide personal information. You choose whether to engage in these activities. Depending upon the activity, some of the information Toro asks you to provide is identified as mandatory and some is voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity. 

In addition to the information you choose to provide, Toro may automatically collect other information about you. Such information may include, without limitation: the unique device identifier of your mobile device, mobile network information, the model and serial number and telephone number of your mobile device, your geographic location, information regarding your access to and use of an App, the Site pages you visit and the time of your visits, your operating system, browser type, the domain name of your internet service provider, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. We may combine any of the information we collect from or about you and use it in the manner described in this Privacy Policy. For example, Toro may use your IP address, together with other personal information that you may provide through the Site, such as your email address, to communicate with you directly about products and services that Toro believes may be of interest based on your activity on the Site.
