At toryburchoutletsale.com, we recognize and respect the importance of maintaining the privacy of our customers and have established this Privacy Policy as a result.

Information you enter is collected even if you cancel or do not complete an order. Also, if you register as a customer, we request your name, address, phone number, email address, and other information set forth on the My Account Page. 

 How we use the information we collect about you.

We do not make your email addresses available to third parties (except for subsidiaries, subcontractors or agencies acting on our behalf in compliance with this Privacy Policy). By no means will we ever SELL or SHARE your email address to any third parties. In the future, if we do, we will first amend this policy.

 Data Security 

The information you provide - including credit card information - is secured using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology.

The encrypted data goes to a secure site where your information is stored on restricted-access computers located at restricted-access sites. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information.

We encourage you to read the posted privacy statement and user terms and conditions whenever interacting with, and prior to providing any personal information to, any other web site.
