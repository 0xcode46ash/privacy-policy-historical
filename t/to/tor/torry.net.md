Does your program need word processing capability? If so, WPTools should be your first choice. With its own RTF engine, WPTools is a collection of components which offers numerous features that the Win32 Richedit2.dll can’t. This control lets you use tables, paragraph frames, headers and footers - including page numbers, bulleted and numbered lists, different types of paragraph alignment (justified, left, right, centered) and various types of tab stops (left, right and decimal), as well as special text attributes, such as hyperlinks or hidden text. Text is formatted with WYSIWYG, including page breaks and which are shown in the editor! Texts can be imported and exported in RTF, HTML and ANSI or you can implement your own formats.
