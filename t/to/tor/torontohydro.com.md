# Privacy Policy | Toronto Hydro Corporation

### Privacy Policy 

**Introduction**   
Toronto Hydro Corporation ["Toronto Hydro"] respects the privacy of every individual who visits the Toronto Hydro web site. Accordingly, this privacy statement has been developed to inform you about Toronto Hydro's information collection, usage and disclosure practices.

**Anonymous vs. Personally Identifiable Information**   
Anonymous Information refers to information that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that tells Toronto Hydro who you are, such as your name, phone number, mailing address or e-mail address.

**General Principles**   
Toronto Hydro will not collect, use or disclose to a third party your Personally Identifiable Information without your consent, except where (a) such information could contribute to a legal investigation, or (b) such information could aid in an emergency where people’s lives and safety may be at stake. There may be circumstances where Toronto Hydro infers that you have given the necessary consent, but in those circumstances Toronto Hydro will only collect, use and disclose your Personally Identifiable Information for the purposes for which such information was provided. For example, where you give Toronto Hydro your Personally Identifiable Information so an account may be opened in your name, Toronto Hydro will infer that you have consented to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personally Identifiable Information for the purpose of opening your account, but not for any other purposes or uses.

Part of your use of this web site will include the opportunity to electronically submit Personally Identifiable Information to Toronto Hydro. Although these opportunities are provided for you as part of Toronto Hydro’s efforts to serve you better, you are never obliged to give away your Personally Identifiable Information. If you do decide to provide Personally Identifiable Information, it will be encrypted using 128 bit technology so that it will arrive unread and unaltered at Toronto Hydro’s servers. Upon receipt of your Personally Identifiable Information, Toronto Hydro will take steps to ensure that it is appropriately safeguarded with password protection.

**Automatic Data Collection  
** When you access the Toronto Hydro web site, the site software automatically collects the internet protocol (IP) address of the computer through which you are connected to the internet. This web site also automatically collects information about your internet browser, operating system, the date and time of your visit, and the path which you followed immediately before accessing this site. All the information that is automatically submitted to Toronto Hydro is considered Anonymous Information. 

**Cookies**   
When you access the Toronto Hydro website, a cookie is automatically installed on your hard-drive. A cookie is a small text file that contains a unique identification number, which can be used to identify your browser, but not you. Cookies form an essential part of the internet today by allowing servers to recognize users’ browsers when the users return to previously visited websites. Since cookies are only text files, they cannot "run" on your computer and have no ability to search your computer for information or to transmit information to anyone. Although cookies may help enrich your internet experience, you are free to prevent the installation of cookies on your hard-drive, including the Toronto Hydro cookie, by simply disabling the feature in your browser's options.

**E-Mail Communications**   
Toronto Hydro adheres to a no "spam" policy. Therefore, you will not receive regular, unsolicited e-mail communications from Toronto Hydro unless you have explicitly agreed otherwise. In addition, you may easily change your decision to regularly receive e-mail communications from Toronto Hydro. To be removed from Toronto Hydro's e-mailing list, simply follow the "unsubscribe" option found at the bottom of any regular Toronto Hydro e-mail communication. Please note that in circumstances where you have voluntarily provided Toronto Hydro with your e-mail address, Toronto Hydro reserves the right to send you a one-time e-mail communication, regardless of your e-mail contact status. In addition, Toronto Hydro reserves the right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of Toronto Hydro's Terms of Use.

**Your Rights**   
You have the right to know precisely what Personally Identifiable Information Toronto Hydro has collected about you, as well as the use and disclosure of such information. In addition, you have the right to ensure that your Personally Identifiable Information is accurate, and where any errors may exist, to have such information corrected immediately. To make a request to review your Personally Identifiable Information, please contact [webmaster@torontohydro.com](mailto:webmaster@torontohydro.com "webmaster@torontohydro.com").

**Effective Date**   
The effective date of this privacy policy is October 23, 2000. Toronto Hydro reserves the right to update this policy from time to time, and it is your responsibility to check for any such updates
