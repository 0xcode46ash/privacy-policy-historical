Torrid Privacy Policy

**Introduction**  
Thank you for visiting [torrid.com](http://www.torrid.com/) (the “site”). References in this privacy policy to “Torrid,” “we,” “us” or “our” mean Hot Topic, Inc. Torrid is a business of Hot Topic, Inc.  
Respecting and protecting the privacy of our customers (including users of the site) is of great importance to us at Torrid. This notice describes our policies of information collection and our use practices, and highlights choices you may have about the way we use and share such information. Please read this policy so that you can understand how we use your personal information.    
Collection of Information   
On the site, you may be able to purchase merchandise, participate in our community features like chat rooms or bulletin boards, become a registered user, maintain a wish list or store other information on the site, enter sweepstakes and contests, participate in surveys and polls, e-mail or instant message, subscribe to a service, or enroll to receive certain entertainment or information. We may need or request certain types of personally identifiable information (i.e., information that can directly identify you or indicate where you may be contacted, such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, or credit card information) and collect it in connection with these various activities and offerings. We may also collect age, date of birth, sex, and grade level. We do not consider demographic information about you; indications of your interests, likes, and dislikes; or general characteristics such as clothing size or hair color to be personally identifiable information unless it is somehow grouped with other information so as to permit identification of you specifically.    
As you use the site, certain information may also be collected passively, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system. We also use cookies and navigational data like uniform resource locators (URLs) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the information for which you searched and viewed. This type of information is collected to better understand how you use our community and make the community and the services we provide more useful to you.

When you sign up to become a divastyle® member, we collect the following information about you: name, address, phone number, birth date, e-mail address, and sex. If you are a divastyle member, when you purchase products in our stores or through the site, we collect information about the products you purchase, and we associate this information with your personally identifiable information. When you apply for a Torrid credit card, we collect information relevant to your credit application.    
Sometimes you can submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card or, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to a friend, you might submit the friend's name and address, should we be offering that service. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages may include: the recipient's name, address, age, date of birth, grade level, e-mail address, sex, or telephone number. 

**Use and Disclosure of Information**  
We use personally identifiable information for various purposes. For example, we may use information you provide to process your purchases of merchandise or to provide for merchandise delivery to your home. As a registered user, you provide us with information that we maintain and reference as part of our attempts to provide better and more personalized service to you. We may also use online registries or other databases to permit you to use and participate in certain portions or features of our site. We also use information that users provide to conduct sweepstakes and contests, notify you if you win, and fulfill prizes or awards. In addition, unless you tell us not to, we like to provide you with certain information about our merchandise, sales or other offerings, and other marketing materials designed to help you use our site and visit our stores with more information. We also use such information to make our online marketing and other communications with you more efficient. Similarly, we may use personally identifiable information in connection with certain activities with our partners, such as marketing efforts, cosponsorships, and other initiatives. We also collect this information as may be reasonably necessary for tracking/verifying compliance with federal, state, and local laws or for editorial and feedback solicitation purposes.  
We may create anonymous records from personally identifiable information by excluding information (such as your name) that makes you personally identifiable. We reserve the right to use and disclose anonymous information to third parties at our discretion.

We may, from time to time, augment the information you give us with information from other sources, such as information validating your address. Thus, information we obtain may be intermingled and used in conjunction with information obtained through other sources, including both offline and online sources.   
We may share personal information with third parties. For instance, there may be third-party service providers for our operations or business activities with whom we have an agreement for services. These service providers may transmit, store, analyze, or otherwise use such information in connection with their services to us. We also occasionally share information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. In most cases, we limit the information shared with third parties to anonymous information or aggregate information. In some cases, we share your personally identifiable information (including divastyle membership information) with third parties for their marketing purposes. For example, when you sign up to become a divastyle member, we share your personal information with a third-party credit card issuer for the sole purpose of prescreening you for an offer of a Torrid credit card.    
We may share some or all of your information with any parent company, subsidiary, joint venture, or other company under our common control (collectively known as “affiliates”). We require our affiliates to comply with this privacy policy. If our company or our assets are acquired by another company, that company will possess the information collected by us.  
We may offer e-mail services, contests, sweepstakes, or promotions that are sponsored or cosponsored by nonaffiliated companies. Based on our agreement with them, these third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that site visitors voluntarily submit to participate in contests, sweepstakes, or promotions. We have no control over the use of this information by these companies. 

**Opting Out**  
We strive to make sure your preferences are respected. Therefore, except with respect to our sharing your personal information with a third-party credit card issuer (World Financial Network National Bank) for prescreening purposes, you can tell us if you don’t want us to share your personal information with third parties for the third parties’ marketing purposes by contacting us either at the address below or by calling Torrid Customer Service at 866-867-7431. We will endeavor to implement this request within a reasonable period of time of receiving it.

In the e-mails we send you, we include the ability to “opt out” of receiving any further such communications, and we encourage you to exercise those rights as you see fit.    
Cookies   
You should also know that, like many Web sites, our Web sites use "cookies," which are small amounts of data sent to your browser from a Web server that is stored on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to help us “remember” who you are, to ease navigation of the site, and to help target merchandise and other offerings to suit your personal interests, as well as for more general reasons, such as gauging audience size and analyzing visitor patterns. We also may contract with third parties who may use cookies and collect such information on our behalf. You can usually set your browser to not accept cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. But be aware that if you disable cookies, we may not be able to provide you with optimally tailored and targeted service on our site.

**Security**  
We are committed to handling your personal information with the highest standards of information security. We work hard to maintain the security and accuracy of the personally identifiable information we collect. Security measures include limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers, employing electronic security systems, and password protections that guard against unauthorized access. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your credit card information as it is transmitted to us. Please click on the Verisign Logo to learn more. Also, our customer service center and stores implement industry-standard security measures. Please note that e-mail is not encrypted and is not considered to be a secure means of transmitting credit card information.  
Persons Under 13 

We do not intentionally collect information from persons under the age of 13.

**International Users**  
If you use the site from outside the United States, your connection will be through and to servers located in the United States, your orders placed through the site will be fully processed in and shipped from the United States, and all information you provide will be processed and maintained in our Web servers and internal systems located within the United States. By using the site, you authorize the export of personal information to the United States and its storage and use as specified above when you provide such information to us. This policy and our legal obligations are subject to the laws of the State of California and the United States, regardless of the location of any user. Any claims or complaints must be filed in the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles County, California. 

**Links to Other Sites and Public Areas**  
You should be aware that when you are on the Site you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from pages on the site that take you outside our service. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, or a link, the "click" takes you off the site.  We are not responsible for the content or privacy policy of those sites.  These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information. Always be aware where you end up! 

Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online -- for example, via message boards -- that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While we strive to protect personal information provided to us and our users’ privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit online and you do so at your own risk.   
Our policy does not extend to anything inherent in the operation of the Internet, and such inherent traits are therefore beyond our control.

**Changes in this Privacy Policy**  
This Privacy Policy is a living document. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, in which case we will post the changes to this Privacy Policy page, the Site, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what Personal Information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

**Contact Us**  
If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our Privacy Policy please contact us.
