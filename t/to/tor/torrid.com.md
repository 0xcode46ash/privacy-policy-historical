**The Internet, Privacy and Torrid Online** |  |   
---|---|---  
  
The Internet contains a massive amount of information. Unfortunately, it may also contain personal details about you that you don't want everyone to know. For example, your real name (lots of people on the Internet use aliases, alter egos or nicknames), street address, phone number, or e-mail address. Also, when you go online, sites you visit may be gathering information about you - without your knowledge.   
  
**Torrid Online's Policy**  
  
  
Torrid Online's policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. Torrid Online will never willfully disclose individually identifiable information about its customers to any third party without first receiving that customer's permission. This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it. Using the Internet should be a fun experience and we want to help you make it so. 

Torrid Online occasionally shares information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. However, in most cases, we talk about our users in aggregate, not as individuals. For example, we will say Torrid Online's audience is x percent females, and x percent males. This data is used to customize Torrid Online content for our users. 

There are cases where Torrid Online may ask you for personal information such as your name or address. We do this when you register for membership or contests/promotions or services that require registration or subscription or when you place an order. 

Torrid Online needs to collect this information for fulfilling prizes, tracking/verifying compliance with federal, state and local laws and/or for editorial and feedback solicitation purposes. When we intend to use personal information, we will tell you up front. 

This way you can decide whether you want to give us the information or not. For example, we may want to post the names of contest winner's on our site or send you materials via e-mail or regular mail at your request. In case any personal information changes, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you gave us.   
  
  
**Security**  
  
At torrid.com we protect the integrity of our customers' credit card information. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your credit card information as it is transmitted to us. Please click on the Verisign Logo to learn more.

**Links to other sites**  
Users should be aware that when you are on Torrid Online, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from Torrid Online pages that take you outside our service. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, or a link, the "click" takes you off the Torrid Online site. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information. Always be aware where you end up! 

Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online-for example, via message boards - that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While Torrid Online strives to protect its user's personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk. 

Torrid Online's policy does not extend to anything inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Torrid's control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. 

We reserve the right at our discretion to make changes to this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes.
