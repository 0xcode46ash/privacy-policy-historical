#### Prom Hair Styles

A great prom hair style is so important for your prom look! To make sure you look your absolute best on your big night be sure to plan ahead. It's a good idea to practice your prom hair updo several weeks before your prom to see how long it will take, what items you will need, and if it's really the style for you and your dress. If you're having your hair done at a salon, make an appointment well in advance and take along a picture to show your stylist exactly what you want. Your prom pics will be great and you'll have more fun as you dance the night away.

#### Dressing Your Maids

The first step to choosing a bridesmaid gown is to determine the formality, style and fabric of the wedding gown so that the maids gowns do not overpower the bride. Choose the color first to narrow choices. You might want to begin choosing a gown style with the larger maids in mind. In recent years, prices have declined making the average maid's dress only $140. With careful selection, your bridesmaids will be happy with the final results and spend the wedding day celebrating with the bride and her groom.

#### How to Shop for Your Dress

Start shopping early. Try on lots of different styles to narrow your choices. Formal dresses run about one size smaller than your regular clothes. Take the salesperson's suggestions about what styles and colors look good on you. Let them help you try on the dresses to save you time. Alterations are important for a perfect fit. Allow plenty of time for alterations and fittings. Bring the shoes you will be wearing to your appt. Buy your jewelry, shoes and other accessories at the time of the dress purchase. Have a great time at your formal event!
