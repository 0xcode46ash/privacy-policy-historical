#### Prom Hair Styles

The perfect hairstyle completes your perfect look for prom. Look at our website, or through magazines to find styles that would work with your hair and your dress. Practice your hairstyle several times before the special event to see how long it will take and to ensure you have all the right supplies and equipment to make it work. Make sure you feel comfortable and beautiful in your selected hairstyle. If you are having it done for you, be sure to take along the photo so the stylist knows what your vision is of your total look. On your special night, you’ll look terrific, so don’t forget to smile pretty for all those photos!

#### Dressing Your Maids

The first step to choosing a bridesmaid gown is to determine the formality, style and fabric of the wedding gown so that the maids gowns do not overpower the bride. Choose the color first to narrow choices. You might want to begin choosing a gown style with the larger maids in mind. In recent years, prices have declined making the average maid's dress only $140. With careful selection, your bridesmaids will be happy with the final results and spend the wedding day celebrating with the bride and her groom.

#### How to Shop for Your Dress

Many dresses sell out during prom season so for best selection – shop early! Try on different styles to discover your favorite look. Or if you are ordering online, take accurate measurements to get the best fit as formal dresses usually run small. Alterations are important for a perfect fit so don’t be discouraged if your dress doesn’t fit you perfectly but purchase your dress as early as possible to allow time for alterations and fittings. Buy your jewelry, shoes and other accessories at the same time to make things easier. After you are all done with shopping you can relax and dream of your big night! Have a great time!
