**Changes to This Policy and Questions About Privacy.**

T3Leads reserves the right to make changes to this policy. Those changes will become effective 30 days after notice of them is posted here. 

**Why your transaction with T3Leads is secure**

T3Leads **** uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL for short) to combat security risks in sending data over the Internet. SSL has been standard equipment on browsers several years. If your computer has version 4 or higher of Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer or AOL you have SSL.   
SSL server authentication allows your browser to confirm a server's identity. Using standard techniques of public-key cryptography, it checks that the server's certificate and public ID are valid and have been issued by a certificate authority (CA) listed in the browser's list of trusted CAs.   
An SSL connection encrypts all information sent between your browser and our server. This provides an extremely high degree of confidentiality. In addition, all data sent over an encrypted SSL connection is protected with a mechanism for detecting tampering--that is, for automatically determining whether the data has been altered in transit.   
T3Leads uses SSL whenever sensitive information is sent or received from your computer. When you see the Key (Netscape) or Lock (Internet Explorer or AOL) you can be sure that it really is T3Leads, and not an imposter. You can also be sure that nobody else can see or alter your information in transit.
