# Privacy Policy | WJLA.com

Last Updated: 10/04/2013

## PRIVACY PRACTICES

This statement discloses the privacy practices for the WJLA.com website, mobile websites and applications associated therewith (together, the "Website") a service provided by WJLA-TV/NewsChannel 8, a division of Allbritton Communications Company ("WJLA"). Questions regarding this statement should be directed to WJLA at privacy@wjla.com or 1100 Wilson Blvd., 6th Floor, Arlington, Virginia 22209. This privacy policy does not apply to data collected offline including, but not limited to, data collected via the mail, telephone or at live events.

## CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION

The information gathered by WJLA falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by users to the Website through optional registration and (2) tracking information gathered as users navigate through the Website.

## Registration

To make use of certain features on the Website users may need to register and to provide certain information as part of the registration process. (WJLA may ask, for example, for a user's name, email address, gender, age, and zip code.) The information supplied will help WJLA to offer more personalized features, to tailor the Website, and to make it more useful to users. Supplying such information is entirely voluntary. However, if a user chooses not to supply information requested, WJLA may be unable to provide the user with services made available to other users of the Website. Even if a user wishes to remain completely anonymous, the user may still to take advantage of the content available on the Website without registration.

## Uses of Information

WJLA may present information collected from users of the Website to third parties. Such information is generally in the form of aggregated statistics on traffic within the Website, although from time to time, WJLA may share personal information on users of the Website with those marketing products and services that we believe may be of interest to users.

## Cookies

To help make the Website more responsive to the needs of users, the Website employs a standard feature of browser software, called a "cookie," to assign each user a unique, random number that resides on a user's computer. The cookie does not personally identify the user; it merely identifies the computer with which the user accesses the Website. Unless a user voluntarily identifies himself or herself (through registration, for example), the Website will not be able to identify the identity of the user, even if a cookie is assigned to a user's computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information supplied by a user. The advertisers on the Website may also assign their own cookies to a user's browser, a process that WJLA does not control. The Website uses cookies to help tailor the Website and deliver a more personalized service. Of course, users are free to instruct their web browsers not to accept cookies and/or opt-out of third party cookies via the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) or other websites; however, doing so may render a computer unable to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users of the Website.

## IP Addresses & Device Information

The Website's servers automatically collect limited information about a user's computer's connection to the Internet, including a user's IP address. (The IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send data - such as the web pages users view.) An IP address does not personally identify a user. We may also track device identification statistics and other non-identifying information for the purpose of analytics, push notifications, and error reporting. The Website uses this information to deliver its content to users upon request, to tailor the Website to a user's interests, and to measure traffic within the Website.

## Third Party Sites

The Website includes links to third party websites whose privacy policies WJLA does not control. Once a user leaves the Website, use of any information a user provides is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site the user is visiting. The privacy policies of third party websites may differ from that of WJLA.

## Children's Privacy

This children's privacy statement explains WJLA's practices with respect to the online collection and use of personal information from children under the age of 13, and provides important information on user's rights under federal law with respect to such information. WJLA does NOT knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. WJLA screens users who wish to provide personal information in order to prevent users under the age of 13 from providing such information. If WJLA becomes aware that it has inadvertently received personally-identifiable information from a user under the age of 13, WJLA will delete such information from its records. Because WJLA does not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, it also does NOT knowingly distribute such information to third parties. WJLA does NOT knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information.

## Miscellaneous

All information gathered on the Website is stored within a WJLA-controlled database accessible only to WJLA. However, as effective as the reasonable security measures implemented by WJLA may be, no security system is impenetrable. WJLA cannot guarantee the security of its database, nor can it guarantee that information supplied will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet. Users should understand that the Web is an evolving medium. If WJLA needs to change its privacy policy at some point in the future, WJLA will post the changes before they take effect.
