# Privacy Policy - TeeBeeDee

Last Updated: January 15, 2008

[](http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.tbd.com&sealid=101)

Your privacy is our most cherished principle. Our Director of Community, [Kat Brennan](https://web.archive.org/profile/KatBrennan) appears on your profile page. This way you can immediately ask any questions, any time.

We work hard to earn and keep your trust, so we adhere to the following principles to protect your privacy:

  * We will only ask members for personal information if we need it to provide the service  
they request or if the information will help us better serve their overall interests.
  * We will never provide members' personally identifiable information to third parties for marketing purposes.
  * We will never share a member's contact information with another member, without their express consent.
  * We will always give members the option to edit the information that they provided to us or to have their personal information removed from our records.

## Information Collection.

_Registration_

In order to become a TeeBeeDee member, you must first create an account on the TeeBeeDee web site. To create an account you are required to provide the following contact information: user name, email address, country, ZIP/postal code), and choose a password. Please keep in mind that your user name will be publicly available on the site.

_Profile Information_

Once a member, you may provide additional information in the Profile section. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables you to better find relevant content from TeeBeeDee and our other members. Examples include hobbies, favorite books and music reviews. Profile information is publicly available on the site.

_Cookies & Log Files_

Like most web sites, TeeBeeDee uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows TeeBeeDee to recognize you as a member when you return to our site using the same computer and web browser. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use our website. Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on the web site.

One type of cookie, known as a "persistent" cookie, is set once you've logged in to your TeeBeeDee account. The next time you visit the TeeBeeDee web site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing member so you will not need to log in before using the service. In order to access or change any of your private information, however, you must log in securely again with your password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie. Additionally, if you log out of the TeeBeeDee site you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. Another type of cookie, called a "session" cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the TeeBeeDee site. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.

Web pages may contain an electronic file called a web beacon that allows a web site to count users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies. We may use web beacons in a similar manner to cookies to customize your experience and to track aggregate user activity. Web beacons, like cookies, don't tell us anything about you personally.

Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the TeeBeeDee web site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave TeeBeeDee. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the name of your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the TeeBeeDee Service. The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is never shared with third-parties without your permission or except when required by law.

Some companies that present advertising on our site place a cookie on your computer when you view their advertisements on our site. We do not give any personally identifiable information to them as part of this relationship. Unless you visit the web site of these companies and provide them with personally identifiable information about yourself, these tracking technologies tell those advertisers nothing about who you are. Our advertisers' use of tracking technology is subject to their own privacy policies.

_Information from Other Sources_

TeeBeeDee does not supplement the information we collect about you from other sources.

_Information for Contests and Sweepstakes_

If TeeBeeDee offers a contest or sweepstakes on the TeeBeeDee Site, we may ask for additional information such as name, address, and phone number in order to provide the winner with their prize. We would not use that information for any other purpose unless we receive consent at the time you provide the information.

_Information about your Friends_

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about TeeBeeDee, send them an article or other item from the site, or invite them to join a group, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. We may include your name or email address in the email we send to your friend. TeeBeeDee stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. We will not release this person's email address to any third party for any reason.

_Friend Finder_

Our site includes a "Friend Finder" feature. If you choose, you can provide us with your web email address and your password and we will search your email account to see if there is a match between any of the emails in your account and our registered users. If there is a match, you will be offered the opportunity to send a message inviting your friend to be linked to you on TeeBeeDee. If your friend accepts, he or she will be provided your user name and you will be linked as friends on the site.

Similarly, we will use the email address you provide to us as part of your user account to match you with your friends who are registered TeeBeeDee users. If you deny your friends' invitation, you will not be linked as friends on the site. If you do not want your email address to be searchable by friends who are looking for you on TeeBeeDee, you may opt out of this feature in your [profile](https://web.archive.org/editProfile.html).

We also offer the "Invite a Friend" feature. This gives you an opportunity to send an invitation to join TeeBeeDee to friends listed in your web email account who do not appear to be registered TeeBeeDee users. If you accept, we will send those friends an email inviting them to join TeeBeeDee. The invitation email will include your email address.

We will not use any of the information that you provide to us in this process, including your email account log-in information and the emails in your account, for any other purpose.

_Children_

Children are not eligible to use TeeBeeDee and we ask that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us or use the service.

## Information Use.

TeeBeeDee is an online service dedicated to helping us learn from experts and each other. The personally identifiable information you choose to provide on this site is used to help you describe yourself to other members. We also use the information you provide us about yourself to better understand our users and their preferences so that we can make our products and services more useful and relevant. Other information, that does not personally identify you as an individual, is collected by TeeBeeDee Inc. from the site (such as, by way of example, patterns of utilization) and is exclusively owned by TeeBeeDee Inc. This information can be utilized by TeeBeeDee in such manner as TeeBeeDee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.

_TeeBeeDee Communications_

TeeBeeDee will communicate with you through email and alerts posted on this website. Please be aware that you will always receive certain emails from TeeBeeDee related to the proper functioning of your account and other administrative matters such as changes to our services, updates to our privacy policy or terms of use, security announcements and other similar messages.

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe by following the link provided in every newsletter.

Once you have registered with TeeBeeDee, we may send you promotional information about TeeBeeDee products and services, unless you have opted out of receiving such information. If you wish to opt-out of receiving promotional emails about TeeBeeDee products and services, please send a request to [memberservices@TeeBeeDee.com](mailto:memberservices@TeeBeeDee.com).

_Customized Content_

Information you provide at registration or in your Profile section is also used to customize your experience on the web site. For example, when you login to your account we may show you a new discussion about gardening if that is something you indicated interests you.

## Information Sharing.

_Marketing and Advertising_

TeeBeeDee takes the privacy of our members very seriously. We will never sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to any third parties for marketing purposes.

_Our Service Providers_

We hire third-parties to help us provide our services to you. These services may include technical services, customer support, email message deployment, data processing and other services. We also may hire third-parties to provide other specialized products or services that you have requested, such as career evaluations. It may be necessary for us to provide these third parties with some of your personal information in order for them to fulfill their services. For example, we use Constant Contact to send our e-mail newsletters, so if you sign up for a newsletter, we will provide them your email address and your first and last name as necessary to provide you with the newsletter. These third parties do not retain, share or store any personally identifiable information except to provide these services and are bound by strict confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information.

_Links to Other Sites_

This web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by TeeBeeDee Inc., including links contained in the advertisements of our marketing partners. Please be aware that we, TeeBeeDee Inc., are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.

We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.

This privacy statement applies only to information collected by TeeBeeDee.

_Aggregated or Anonymous Data_

We may provide third parties with aggregated or anonymous data about our users and their usage of our services that do not contain any individual's personally identifiable information. We may provide or use this data for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate.

If you enter into a discussion on TeeBeeDee, you should be aware that your posts are public and any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other members, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.

We may remove the posting and/or terminate the account of any visitor who submits inappropriate content to our discussions.  
_  
Communications between Members_

If you want to contact another TeeBeeDee member, you may send a message through TeeBeeDee. We will not disclose your email address to that member, or theirs to you.  
_  
Legal Proceedings_

It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information when required by law. We will disclose such information where we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to comply with a court order, ongoing judicial proceeding, or other governmental or legal process, subpoena or warrant served on our company, to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, or when we believe that your actions violate applicable laws, our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/view/page.basic/company_terms_of_use), or threaten the rights, property, or safety of our company, our users, or others.

_Business Transfer_

If we sell all or a portion of our business, we may transfer some or all of your information as a part of the sale in order that the service being provided to you may continue or for other business purposes.

You can also close your account through the TeeBeeDee website. If you close your TeeBeeDee account, we will remove your profile and other personally identifiable information from our publicly viewable data, but your posts (with user name) will remain. We may retain certain data contributed by you if it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally-identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law. All retained data will continue to be subject to the terms of the TeeBeeDee Privacy Policy that you have previously agreed to.
