Our stores may ask for proof of age if an item with an age restriction is purchased and it is unclear to the associate that you are over the applicable age.

## What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?

The sort of information we collect depends on what you need us to do for you, or how much information we need to identify who you are and resolve your query. 

  * Your name and address so we can make sure an online order reaches you
  * Your email address so we can set up an online account for you, send you important information relating to your order and send you marketing emails if you ask us to (click here to see how you can request marketing emails or ask us not to send them).

In addition we might use the personal information you provide for our internal purposes, for example, website administration, analysis, reporting and compliance purposes or to improve merchandise selections, enhance customer service or invite you to get involved in customer research.

## How do we protect your personal information?

We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical security safeguards to protect against loss, misuse or unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the personal information you provide on our website, in our stores and through other means.

See our [payment page](https://web.archive.org/page/faqs/#makingapayment) for how we protect your financial information online.

Obviously no collection or transmission of information over the internet is 100% secure and although we take every possible measure, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any such transmission.

You can assist with protection by ensuring that if you create a password to access any section of our website, you make sure it is hard to guess, contains a combination of letters and figures and you keep it safe by not disclosing it to anyone. If someone logs in as you using your email and password we will not be able to detect that it is not you and cannot be responsible for any action we take in response to someone using your user name and password.

## How can you get access to any information we have about you?

You may request a copy of the personal information held about you, and you have the right to have any inaccuracies on record about you corrected. TJX charges £10 for UK requests and will require you to prove your identity before providing any data. Send any requests for access, or queries regarding access, to the Data Protection Officer, TJX Europe, 50 Clarendon Road, Watford, WD17 1TX or email [data_protection@tjxeurope.com](mailto:data_protection@tjxeurope.com).

## Our mailing list - getting on and getting off!

When you use our website, receive an email from us, place an order or enter a competition you will get the opportunity to subscribe to our mailing list for our email newsletters – hot@rrivals and Friends of HomeSense which keep you up to date with new and exciting products arriving in our stores and online.

In the event that we run a promotion in conjunction with another sponsor, your personal information may be shared with such sponsors, but this will be specified at the time of collection. We do not control the use, disclosure or security of your personal information by other sponsors, so we recommend you carefully review their Privacy Notice.

## What are cookies and web beacons and how do we use them?

Cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer's hard drive when you visit certain websites. We use cookies to tell us whether you have visited us before or if you are a new visitor, and they help us identify features of our site which may interest you the most. When you save preferences on a particular site you activate a cookie from that site and that's what causes the site to recognise your preferences every time you access the site from the same computer.

We sometimes use a third party to help us analyse the information we get from cookies and we use this information to improve the appearance of our website and make it easier for customers to use.

If you are not happy about receiving cookies, most Internet browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to request alerts when you receive a new cookie and how to disable existing cookies. Some useful information about cookies can be found at www.aboutcookies.org. We should point out, however, that cookies in general help you to benefit from the features of a website and without them you may not be able to take full advantage of what the website has to offer.

Web beacons (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs) allow permitted third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer, the details of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was used, the type of browser used to view it and the information in the cookies which the third party has set. We use beacons to measure how effective our advertising has been, and any third parties we use are contractually restricted from using any personal data collected for their own or others' purposes.

## How do we protect your information when you apply for a job?

When applying for a job online with TJX you can submit your CV and other relevant personal information on our website. We will ask you to register your details by providing an email address and password. Any information you provide is maintained in a database which is managed on our behalf by a service provider in the US. They are authorised to use the information only in connection with hosting, managing and maintaining our CV database and they can process your data only in accordance with our instructions. We use the information you submit to process your application.

If you apply for a job by submitting an application form to our stores or by post, we will retain it securely for a limited period relevant to the vacancies available.

We will share your information only as requested by you or in accordance with the statements in this Privacy Policy. Information for unsuccessful candidates will be destroyed within a reasonable period once the vacancy and other suitable vacancies have been filled or the search otherwise concluded.
