# TTG ASIA - Privacy Policy

  
TTG Asia Media is committed to protecting any personal information that you, as a visitor to our websites, may provide to us. In particular, we believe it is important for you to know how we treat information about you that we may receive from our websites.

Collection of Information  
For each visitor to our websites, our web server may automatically recognize and store information, such as the visitor's IP address/domain name combination. When you visit our websites or advertisements appearing thereon, or use one or more of our website services, we may use an industry-wide technology called "cookies" which stores certain information on your computer and which will allow us to customize your experience to better match your interests and preferences, or to simply facilitate your signing in to use the services. Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. However, if you block or erase cookies, we may not be able to restore any preferences or customization settings you previously specified, and our ability to personalize your online experience would be limited. Please refer to your browser instructions or "help" screen to learn more about these functions.

Additionally, we may ask you to provide "personal information," meaning individually identifiable information that you provide on our websites such as your e-mail address, name, mailing address, telephone number, national ID number, credit card number, personal and business demographic details, or unique identifier (such as a customer number held in a cookie) which is associated with individually identifiable information, to enable you to participate in activities, to fill out a registration, or to order products and services using TTG Asia Media's websites. If you provide us with personal information, you shall have the right, on reasonable prior notice, to inspect, change, amend, or delete such information. Instructions on how to update personal information will be given at the point of data collection. 

As external auditors audit our audience data, we will require you to update your personal information with us at least once a year to comply with our auditor's disclosure requirements.

Use of Collected Information  
Domain name information that we collect is not used to personally identify you and instead is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. We use this information to measure the use of our web site and to improve the content of our web site.

Likewise, your personal demographic data will be aggregated to indicate the profile of the audience of TTG Asia Media services and media properties.

Our media auditors may contact you to determine the veracity of your data in our system.

We use the personal information you provide to respond to your inquiry or to process your request (such as to receive eDaily news, invitation to TTG's sponsored contests and surveys, facilitate buyer/seller matching requests). This information may also be shared with other TTG Asia Media media properties and partners, unless you otherwise indicate.

We may share the personal information you provide with other companies we have hired to provide services for us. These companies - our vendors - are contractually bound to use personal information we share with them only to perform the services we have hired them to provide. We will release information about you if you direct us to do so, if we are required by law to do so, or in other legally limited circumstances (for example, to protect your account from fraud).

If you register with one of TTG Asia Media's business units online, they may use this information to provide you with custom information about TTG Asia Media's offerings in support of your business needs.

Links to Other Sites  
TTG Asia Media's websites may contain links to other sites. While we try to link only to websites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other websites.

Security of Collected Information  
We maintain strict physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect your personal information from unauthorized or inappropriate access. We restrict access to information about you to those TTG Asia Media employees who need to know the information to respond to your inquiry or request. Employees who misuse personal information are subject to disciplinary action.

Questions  
If you have any questions, comments or suggestions about our personal information practices or about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to send us an e-mail at [contact@ttgasia.com](mailto:contact@ttgasia.com)

Changes to this Policy  
The terms of this Privacy Policy will govern the use and any information collected while it is in place. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time, so please re-visit this page as often as you wish. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective at the time they are posted to this website.
