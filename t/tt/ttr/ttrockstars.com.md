This information is required in order to fulfil our contractual obligations to you as it is necessary to correctly identify each registrant as a site User, manage their account and for other purposes identified below. It is impractical in most circumstances for Users to remain anonymous, and we may not be able to interact with you, provide access to the Site, or answer your enquiry if we are not able to identify Users or collect your personal information.

Please note that by registering with the Site and providing the requested personal information, whether on a trial or ongoing basis, the School User’s consent to provide us with information for and on behalf of all Users (to include teachers and pupils) for that school is deemed to be given. It is the school's responsibility to seek and confirm all necessary parental consent for all pupils. Users who do not wish to give this consent must not use the Site.

Please note that by registering with the Site and providing the requested personal information, whether on a trial or ongoing basis, the Home User’s or Tutors’ consent to provide us with information for and on behalf of all Users (to include parents, tutors and children) is deemed to be given.

For the benefit of impact reporting, you may also opt to provide further pupil details, to include; pupil’s date of birth, pupil’s gender, pupil’s Special Education Needs (SEN) status, pupil’s gifted and talented status, pupil’s ethnicity, pupil’s Free School Meal (FSM) status, pupil’s premium status, whether or not children are Looked After Children, and details of any languages spoken at the pupil’s home, however this information is all entirely optional and not required in order to use the Site.

We do not however collect any unnecessary personal information from Users (for instance, information about religious beliefs, medical history etc). 

**_Children and Consent_**

Please note that children (under the age of 18 years) cannot register to use the Site themselves. A teacher, parent or guardian must register for them (either as part of a school subscription or home subscription) and in doing so is consenting on behalf of the child (including on a trial basis) to provide us with their personal information (as identified above). In the case of School Users, it is the school's responsibility to obtain and confirm all necessary parental consent for all pupils. Users who do not give this consent (or who do not have this consent provided on their behalf) cannot provide us with their personal information and must not use the Site.

**How does Maths Circle Ltd keep my personal information secure?**

We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. The data that we collect from you is stored on secure servers in Germany. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. All traffic and passwords are encrypted. As part of our privacy compliance processes we review these security procedures to consider appropriate new technology and methods. 

We use a third party payment processor, Stripe, to process credit card payments made to us. Transactions are encrypted using SSL technology. We do not retain any credit card numbers ourselves. Stripe's use of your personal information is governed by their [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/us/privacy). 

For invoice payments, we use a third party accounting service, FreeAgent, to create and send the invoices. Transactions are encrypted using SSL technology. The information sent to FreeAgent is limited to the billing person's name and email address, the organisation's name and postal address and what you've ordered.

Users should be aware that unfortunately the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. 

We also expect all our employees and contractors to comply with this Privacy Notice, and we will take appropriate actions to address breaches by employees and contractors of the obligations imposed by this Privacy Notice. 

**International Data Transfers**

Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country. Specifically, our Site servers are located in Germany. However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice. 

**Data Retention**

We retain personal information we collect from Users where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements). 

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process User’s personal information, or where you ask us to delete Users’ information, we take reasonable steps to either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store Users’ personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. We may have to retain and use personal information as necessary to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our terms and conditions. 

**Your Data Protection Rights**

Users have the following data protection rights: 

  * If a User wishes to **access, correct, update or request deletion** of their personal information, or that of their school (in the case of teachers), they can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the How to contact us heading below. 
  * In addition, Users can **object to processing** of their personal information, ask us to **restrict processing** of their personal information or **request portability** of their personal information. Again, Users can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the How to contact us heading below. 
  * Users have the right to **opt-out of marketing communications** we send at any time. Users can exercise this right by either clicking on the "unsubscribe" or "opt-out" link in any marketing e-mails we send, or by updating their details on the [My Details] page of our Site. Alternatively, Users can contact us using the contact details provided under the How to contact us heading below. 
  * Similarly, if we have collected and process Users’ personal information with their consent, then Users can **withdraw their consent** at any time. Withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. 
  * Users have the **right to complain to a data protection authority** about our collection and use of their personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. (Contact details for data protection authorities in the European Economic Area, Switzerland and certain non-European countries (including the US and Canada) are available here.) 



We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. 

**Updates to this Privacy Notice**

We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business developments. When we update our Privacy Notice, we will take appropriate measures to inform you, consistent with the significance of the changes we make. We will obtain your consent to any material Privacy Notice changes if and where this is required by applicable data protection laws.
