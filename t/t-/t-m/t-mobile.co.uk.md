# T-Mobile (UK)

Protecting your information  
You are right to be concerned about privacy. 

T-Mobile

makes online security a priority because we want you to feel completely confident about using our website. The following explains how we use and protect the information you might give us.

Security  
Account details  
You will need both a username and password to access your account. For extra security, the password must be at least eight characters long, include one number and use letters or numbers but no spaces. We also recommend changing this regularly.

We protect your password from interception and store it safely. Credit card numbers and other important data are encoded (using 128-bit SSL encryption software) so that when transmitted they can't be viewed fraudulently. Your account details and other such information are also stored on secure servers. We adhere strictly to all relevant UK legislation to make sure information is held securely.

Your handset

  * If you misplace your device, or if it is stolen, call us on 08454 125 000 and we will temporarily suspend your account



Monitor your account activity

  * Review your bills regularly  
If you notice anything suspicious, call us on 150 (charges may apply dependent on your Price plan) from your phone, or 08454 125 000 from any landline, so that we can investigate.



Phishing  
 _What is Phishing?_  
'Phishing' involves emails being sent in an attempt to obtain information about you fraudulently. Both the email and any related links are designed to look genuine to encourage you to release private/account related details.

 _How do they get my email address?_  
Lists of live email addresses are frequently bought or swapped between third parties. We only share information with other members of the Deutsche Telekom group (our parent company) or companies with which we have a business relationship.

_How do they know I am a T-Mobile customer?_  
They don't - but if they send enough emails they are bound to reach some customers.

 _The email says it's from T-Mobile - is it?_  
Very unlikely. Although we do use email, any links will only ever take you back to [www.t-mobile.co.uk](https://web.archive.org/Dispatcher?menuid=menu_item_00)

Some Phishing emails have links to sites that look identical to the original, the browser can also be manipulated to show that the URL address is [www.t-mobile.co.uk](https://web.archive.org/Dispatcher?menuid=menu_item_00) when it is really not. Therefore the best way is for customers to avoid emails that ask for personal details.

 _What should I do if I get a suspicious looking email?_  
If in doubt, delete it. This applies to all emails with links or attachments that you are unsure of.

 _What should I do if I believe I've been a victim of a 'phishing' fraud?_  
You should call us on 150 (charges may apply dependent on your Price plan) from your phone, or 08454 125 000 from any landline, so that we can investigate and change your security details if necessary.

Passwords  
If you're a 

T-Mobile

customer we'll ask you for a password before we show any of your account details. This prevents anyone else seeing them. We use passwords in some other areas of the site to verify your identity. If you don't already have a password, it's simple to set one up. [Click here](https://www.t-mobile.co.uk/Dispatcher?menuid=help_cu_ap "Click here").

Data protection  
We share information with other members of the Deutsche Telekom group (our parent company) and other companies with which we have a business relationship. If we have to send your details to countries without proper data protection laws, we remain responsible for keeping this information secure.

Contacting you  
Until you object, we will use information you give us to provide you with information about goods and services offered by us and other organisations with which we have a business relationship. We or they may contact you by email, telephone, or other online or interactive media. If you would prefer not to receive such information, simply let us know at any time and we will stop sending it to you.

Your details  
As you use your 

T-Mobile

service we hold your account information. Some records are kept for statistical purposes. This helps us understand and serve our customers better and improve our network. Data relating to the routing, timing or duration of a communication may be kept for up to a year. To ensure security for you and our staff and help to maintain service quality, some calls to our Customer Service centres are monitored. Your personal details are not held indefinitely, but are destroyed after a period of time. Some information will be held after you have closed your account with us.

The information we collect  
In various areas of this website we ask you for information.

  * When you place a sales order with us we need to know your name, email address, delivery address, credit or debit card number and expiry date. This lets us process your order.
  * We may offer to send you newsletters or information updates by email. Or we might ask you if you want to enter a competition or promotion. For this we'll ask for an email address.
  * We may ask you for information about yourself and your phone use to help you decide which of our products and services would suit you best.
  * You may want to check that your home or office is covered by the T-Mobile network. To do this we ask you for your postcode.
  * Our 'Ask and find' application, might ask you for information. This is to help us give you the most relevant information.



Cookies  
Cookies are small pieces of information that can be stored on your computer when you use a website. As you go through this website, the cookie 'reminds' us of where you've been. This helps us to save you time and direct you to the most relevant parts of the website.

Credit and fraud checks  
If you apply for credit, we will register and check your details with credit reference agencies to help us make credit decisions about you. We may also check your details with a fraud protection agency. We and other organisations may use and search these records to:

  * make decisions about credit, and credit-related services, for you and members of your household;
  * make decisions on motor, household, credit, life and other insurance proposals and claims, for you and members of your household;
  * trace debtors, recover debt, prevent fraud and to manage your accounts or insurance policies;
  * check your identity to prevent money laundering, in the event that you do not provide other satisfactory identification.



These agencies will also use the records for statistical analysis about credit, insurance and fraud.

Changes to our privacy policy  
If we change our privacy policy we'll publish the changes on this web page so you are always aware of the way we collect, use and disclose information.

Access to your information  
If you want, you can always access your personal information. Just make a written request clearly identifying yourself and the information you require. We'll charge you Â£10 to cover the administrative cost of supplying it. If we hold any inaccurate information about you, we will correct it.
