Tuzara takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. We use the information we collect about you to process orders and to personalize your experience at our website. This privacy statement explains how we gather information and how we protect your privacy. The Tuzara Interactive Social Exchange is a private adult (18 and over) interactive entertainment community that enables its members to interact via integrated media and live events. Tuzara was founded to create an interactive network of interesting and active young professionals who enjoy socializing at live events and for whom the Internet is their primary entertainment, media and information resource. Tuzara, LLC ("TUZARA") believes that communities can only truly be built through interaction and participation among members based on trust, privacy and freedom of expression. In order to do this, we must ask for certain personal information. 

We make every effort to ensure that your information is secure on our system. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.   
This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Tuzara does not own or control, or to people that Tuzara does not employ or manage. 

**Except where you are expressly informed otherwise or as described immediately below, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information except to the financial institution that processes your credit card or check transaction unless required by law or for the protection of your membership.
