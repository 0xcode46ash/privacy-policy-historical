**Collecting Information About You  
**  
You can visit most of our web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We may track the Internet domain address from which people visit us and analyze this data for trends and statistics, but individual users will remain anonymous unless you voluntarily tell us who you are when you make a purchase.

There may be times, such as when you subscribe to a service or participate in a survey, at which we ask you to provide certain information about yourself. This may include your name, email, address, mailing address, phone number, birth date, gender, personal interests, etc. Whether or not to provide such information is your own personal choice. If you choose not to provide information that we request, you may be unable to access certain services, offers or content on our website.

**How does Tuesday Morning use my information?**

When you sign up for email at Tuesday Morning.com, we use your information to contact you regarding our monthly mailer, special sales, weekly ads, and store changes in your area.

From time to time, we may also send you email surveys to help us learn about your shopping preferences so that we can make your Tuesday Morning shopping experience more enjoyable.

We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. If you prefer not to receive information from us about our products and services via email or postal mail, you may unsubscribe at any time by visiting our [Preference Center](http://etreasures.tuesdaymorning.com/).

In addition, if you ask us to remove your name and address from our email or postal mailing list, we maintain your name in a "do not mail" file for a period of time to ensure that we honor your request and can refer to the timeframe in which you directed this action.
