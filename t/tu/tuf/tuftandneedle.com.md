“Service” refers to the services that we provide through our Site, including but not limited to our online store;

## 3\. Information Collected

**Identifying Information Collected by Us**

Have you ever been to a taxidermy store? Generally, taxidermists collect dead animals just to be creepy and weird. At Tuft & Needle we also collect things. However, these things aren’t dead animals and aren’t creepy and weird. Instead we merely collect certain personal information from you when you purchase our Services that can be used to identify you, such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card information, and telephone number. This information is disclosed only in accordance with our Terms of Service and/or this Privacy Policy.

Some of this information—particularly credit card payment information—may be transmitted to the third party payment processor that we use, www.stripe.com, to enable us to process your payments, or you may be required to submit your information to www.stripe.com directly. Stripe has its own Privacy Policy and other conditions of use, and we recommend that you read their documents carefully in order to understand your rights on that website.

**Non-Identifying Information**

Whenever you visit our Site, we may collect non-identifying information from you, such as your IP address, referring URL, browser, operating system, cookie (snickerdoodle is always the best) information, and Internet Service Provider. Without a subpoena, voluntary compliance on the part of your Internet Service Provider, or additional records from a third party, this information alone cannot usually be used to identify you.

We may also proactively report you and release your information without receiving any request to third parties where we believe that it is proper to do so for legal reasons, such as instances where we believe your publications violate any law of the United States or any other country having jurisdiction over us, our Site, Services, or our Terms of Service. You release us from any damages that may arise from or relate to the release of your information to a request from law enforcement agencies or private litigants.
