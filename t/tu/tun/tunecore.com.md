# TuneCore : Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us. None of us at TuneCore would want our own personal information used in ways we didn't agree to or know about. So here are the rules we live by:

  * TuneCore will not sell your information to anyone.
  * TuneCore will not share your information with our partners unless they also agree not to sell or give it away.
  * TuneCore will always use secure methods when handling your sensitive information.



Take a moment to read our privacy policy below to make sure you understand and agree with it.

### Why does TuneCore collect private information?

We need your information in order to provide you our services, pay you, get your music out to our partners, answer questions you may have, keep track of all the things happening with your account, provide customer support, collect fees, provide new opportunities, contact you in case of incomplete information, deliver new products and updates and deliver a high quality experience.

### What information does TuneCore collect?

Depending what services or products you would like, we'll need basic information that might consist of all or part of the following: your name, address, email address, contact phone numbers, credit card information, names of your song(s), name(s) of your Album(s), year that your recordings were made, name of the person, group or entity that owns and controls the rights to each song, Album or artwork delivered to TuneCore, credit/charge card information to collect from you various fees and charges for services and bank account or PayPal account information for deposits of money owed to you from the sale of your music.

From time to time we might also present you with a voluntary survey or questionnaire about our current or possible future services or products. In addition, we might ask for information that will help remind you of your personal user name or password in the event you request retrieval or your user name and/or password.

TuneCore may also set up a system that allows you to purchase and/or send gift certificates or links to Album(s), songs or other TuneCore products or other information to any TuneCore member or to family members, friends or colleagues. To fulfill your request, TuneCore may require personal information about the person to whom you are sending the product or service, such as their name, physical address, email address, etc. The personal information you provide about that person is used only for the purpose for which it is collected. **Neither TuneCore nor its partners with whom we share that data will use the information collected to market directly to that person.**

TuneCore might also keep track of how certain Album(s) and/or songs are selling at different digital stores, like iTunes, for TuneCore ranking charts and inclusion in our newsletter or other areas of our website.

If you use a bulletin board or chat room within TuneCore, you should be aware that any information you share is visible to other users. **Personally identifiable information you submit to one of these forums can be read, collected, or used by other individuals to send you unsolicited messages. TuneCore is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.** In addition, TuneCore may choose to monitor postings on these forums to assure users are complying with TuneCore terms of service.

### Does TuneCore disclose your information to anyone?

We take your privacy very, very seriously. **TuneCore will NOT sell, rent, lend or share your contact information or other personal information with other marketers.** It's possible that key people working for TuneCore might view your information to make sure we are providing you with the best service possible, but they will be required to treat your information according to the policies consistent with the TuneCore privacy policy.

It is also possible that with improvements on existing services or with the addition of new services it may be to your advantage for TuneCore to make specific personal information about you available to companies that TuneCore has a strategic relationship with or that perform work for TuneCore, so they can provide products and services to you on our behalf. These companies may help us process information, extend credit, fulfill customer orders, deliver products to you, manage and enhance customer data, provide customer service, assess your interest in our products and services or conduct customer research or satisfaction surveys. **These companies must also protect your personal information in accordance with TuneCore's policies.** Without such information being made available, it would be difficult for you to sell your music, upload your songs, upload your Album art, purchase products, have products delivered to you, receive customer service, provide us feedback to improve our products and services, or access certain services, offers and content on the TuneCore website.

Your personal information might also be released to specific entities, if TuneCore is required by law or litigation to disclose it. In the very unlikely event we determine it's necessary for national security, law enforcement or other issues of public importance, TuneCore may disclosure your personal information as necessary. In the event that TuneCore receives notification that any content that you have uploaded using the TuneCore services infringes on the rights of a third party claimant, TuneCore reserves the right to disclose your contact information to such third-party claimant, in TuneCore's sole discretion.

### How does TuneCore protect your personal informaiton?

TuneCore will take administrative, technical, physical measures and more to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft or misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

Although there will always be people attempting to steal information, we follow the industry accepted security standards designed to safeguard and prevent unauthorized access, disclosure and use of your personal information. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption for credit card, ACH and other bank transactions. Due to this level of security, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Safari, Netscape Navigator 3.0 or later, or Internet Explorer. Doing so protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while in transit over the Internet. TuneCore has used and will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the protection of your personally identifiable information.

In addition, TuneCore will restrict employee access to databases containing personal information and impose confidentiality requirements upon employees who do need to know it. Any employee that does require partial or total access to personal information, by their need or job description, they must abide by the TuneCore privacy policy.

Finally, you will be given complete discretion to create a user name and password that only you know. **To further protect your information, you should consider changing your password often and only using a browser that supports SSL encryption**.
