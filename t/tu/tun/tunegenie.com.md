**Last updated: August 18, 2008**

**PRIVACY POLICY**

This Privacy Policy applies to all of your use of any MusicToGo, LLC ('M2G') services including music download and information sites and services (collectively, the 'Site'). This Privacy Policy is for you to understand how your personal information will be treated as you use our Site and services. **PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY.**

We use the information we collect about you to process orders and we may, from time to time, collect anonymous demographic information that is not unique to you, to help market our Site to advertisers or potential business partners. We may disclose your name, e-mail address, and other information (including demographic information and information about the music you purchase) to the business partner linking to this M2G store or service. Please read on for more details about our privacy policy. 

When you register, or make a purchase with M2G we ask for your name, password, e-mail address, and postal code. At checkout we also ask for your state of residence for tax calculation and credit card information. This allows us to process and fill your order and to notify you of your purchase status. 

When and if you subscribe for services like newsletters, alerts, special invitations or promotions or download certain software or plug-ins that may be made available by us through our Site, we will use your e-mail address to send the information that you requested. 

When you participate in a promotional feature, we may ask for your name, home or work address, telephone number and e-mail address so we can administer the promotion. 

When you click on a banner advertisement, you pass through our web server before arriving at your destination website. We track click-throughs to help us determine your interest in particular topics, measure the effectiveness of our customer communications, and to help market our Site to advertisers or potential business partners. 

We may personalize your shopping experience by using your purchases and site behavior to shape any recommendations we may make about music files, CDs and other merchandise that might be of interest to you. We also monitor customer traffic patterns and Site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the Site. 

We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to our Site, new services we provide, and special offers we think will be of interest to you. If you would rather not receive this information, please contact us and request that we discontinue providing you with such information. 

We may collect anonymous demographic information that is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, domicile, age, gender, preferences and interests. We may disclose information to affiliates or unaffiliated third parties for the purpose of performing business services for us. In addition, we may disclose such anonymous information to prospective advertisers or business partners. We will not sell or otherwise make available personal information about you to unaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes. We reserve the right to disclose personal information to regulatory authorities, law enforcement agencies or as required by applicable law. 

M2G uses appropriate measures to secure your personal information. Credit card transactions are handled by a third-party, which receives your credit card number and other personal identifying information process the transaction. 

A cookie is a small text file that a Site sends to your computer to record your identification and/or preferences.

When you visit our Site, you may be directed to other sites outside our service. For example, if you click on a banner advertisement, you will leave our site. These third-party sites may send their own cookies to users collect data or solicit personal information. M2G allows third-party advertisers to display advertisements on the M2G Site. These advertisers will place a persistent cookie on your computer, which will enable them to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement.

If you want to prevent one of these third-party companies from sending and reading cookies on your computer, you must contact each company's Web site individually and request that they cease such activity.
