# TUTs Adventurers Club: Explore the power of thought & creative visualization to manifest dreams!

Totally Unique ThoughtsÂ® has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: www.tut.com.

**Why did you receive a "Note from the Universe" email from us?**  
The only ways in which an individual's email address can receive our daily "Notes from the Universe" service is if the recipient opts-in (personally signs-up) to receive such emails, or, _although strongly discouraged at our sign up page_ , when a friend had signed them up. We do not acquire email addresses from 3rd parties.

At any time after registration, users may opt-out of receiving future mailings by simply clicking the "Safe Unsubscribe" button located at the bottom of every email, _instantly and permanently_ removing them from our list.

If you have received unwanted, unsolicited email sent via this system or purporting to be sent via this system, please forward a copy of that email with your comments to [adventure@tut.com](mailto:adventure@tut.com) for review.

**Sharing and Usage**  
We never, under any circumstances, share, rent, sell or otherwise divulge subscribers email addresses, or any other personal information. Information submitted to us is only available to employees managing this information for purposes of sending out our daily "Notes from the Universe."

**How do we protect your privacy?**  
We use a variety of security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of data used by our system, including secure practices by our email server, [Constant Contact](http://www.constantcontact.com/privacy_guarantee.jsp)

**How can you stop receiving email from us?**  
Each email sent contains an easy, "single click" way for you to _instantly and permanently_ cease receiving email from us, or to change your personal profile and mailing frequency.

**Credit Card Security**  
All credit card purchases are placed over our secure server connection. To ensure you are on our secure server make sure you see a padlock on the bottom of your browser window. Make sure you do not enter any credit card information unless you see this padlock. It should be present whenever you are in our shopping cart.

**Choice/Opt-Out**  
This site, as well as our daily emailings, offer users the option for _instantly_ removing their information from our database and to cease receiving all future communications. You may also email us at [adventure@tut.com](mailto:adventure@tut.com) with such requests or when assistance is needed.

**Third Party Websites**  
This site contains links to other sites. **www.tut.com** is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other sites, although we are not unaware of any potential privacy violations they may practice.

**Correct/Update**  
Members may update their database record and make necessary changes, deletions or adjustments, at any time by simply clicking "Update Profile" at the bottom of any email received.

**Contacting the Web Site**  
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with TUT, you can contact the Web Administrator at [TUT World Headquarters](https://web.archive.org/contact/), or by email at [adventure@tut.com](mailto:adventure@tut.com).
