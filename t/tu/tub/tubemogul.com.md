Cookies and Data Collection  
"Cookies" are small files placed on the hard drive of your computer. We use cookies to provide you better service by allowing you to enter your password less frequently during a session and to help us understand and analyze our web page flow.

Cookies are employed to track stream and viewership data and to improve user experience by providing information such as buffering events per user back to our video site partners . Flash Cookies are stored on your computer much the same as browser cookies are, however it is not possible to manage them at browser level in the same way. You can go to Adobe’s web site directly to access your Flash management tools. 

Email and Spam  
You may not use our communication tools to send spam. If you send an email to an email address that is not registered in our community (via Refer a Friend or other tool), we do not permanently store that email or use that email address for any marketing purposes. We do not rent or sell these email addresses. 

Marketing  
Again, we will never sell, rent or disclose your personally identifiable information (i.e., name, email and mailing address) to any third parties without your explicit consent. We may, but are not obliged to, occasionally send you strictly service or feature-related enhancement announcements.
