# Privacy Policy

**Last updated on November 4, 2016  **

TubeMogul (“TubeMogul” “we” or “our”) provides this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy” or “Policy”) to inform people who receive targeted ads (“you” or “Users”) from us or companies we work with about the information that we collect and use in order to provider our advertising services. We also provide information about how to opt out of certain types of targeted advertising, in Section 6 titled “Your Advertising Choices.” We also describe the information that we collect through our corporate website(s), including the website on which this Policy is posted, Section 7 titled “Data Collection and Use on Our Corporate Websites.” 

### 1\. The TubeMogul Ad Targeting Platform

TubeMogul’s advertising platform helps marketers deliver more relevant ads to consumers through various channels, including through online, mobile and television content. To do this, we collect and use a variety of information through our platform, which we describe below. Our advertising platform and related services integrate real-time media buying, ad serving, targeting, ad optimization and measurement, all of which we believe make advertising more effective for marketers and more relevant to customers. 

When we provide our services, we often receive data from and exchange data with Clients and their service providers (collectively, “Clients”). We also work with a number of other data, media and ad platforms (“Partners”), including those engaged by our Clients, with whom we exchange data in order to deliver more relevant ads and support our ad services — some of which are described on this website. 

The advertising we support is often based on Users’ online behavior, location, interests or demographics. This type of advertising is often referred to as “interest-based advertising.” If you want to learn more about or opt out of receiving ads that have been targeted to you through interest-based advertising, please go to Section 6, titled “Your Advertising Choices.” 

### 2\. Information Collected and Used by the TubeMogul Advertising Platform

As mentioned above, we collect and receive data from various Partners and Clients, and sometimes directly from Users. We collect this information both when we serve ads, and when we “sync” or exchange and receive data through various technological means from Partners and Clients. We refer to all of this information as our **“Service Information.** ” 

The Service Information we use is information that has been traditionally referred to (for instance, by the industry-leading NAI Code of Conduct) as “Non-PII” as distinct from “PII” (for instance, name/address, telephone number). We do not use those terms because different people can have different interpretations of those terms, and we want to avoid the confusion that can create. We therefore simply do our best to describe the data points we use to deliver our service. 

The Service Information we collect or receive includes: 

  * Unique identifiers (“UIDs”) that we, a Client or a Partner has associated with a User’s mobile device or other viewing device (such as a set top box or other similar identifier). This includes mobile advertising identifiers such as Apple IDFAs and Android Ad IDs. We or Partners may sometimes tie precise location information to these identifiers, to target ads based on where a User is located.
  * UIDs that we, a Client or a Partner has associated with a User’s browser, through browser “cookies” or similar locally stored objects or code. (Please see Section 4, titled “Cookies, Pixel Tags and SDKs” to learn more about cookies and similar technologies.)
  * Browser and device information, such as your operating system, browser used, or network provider, along with IP addresses, from which general geographic location may be inferred.
  * Information about websites visited, mobile applications used, and other content that you interact with, which may be tied to a UID and which generally includes the date and time of your visit to a website and your interactions with mobile apps whether you have responded to one of our clients’ ads, and the referring URL or mobile application name.
  * We may use the Service Information to create (or collect from Partners) interest-related data segments (“Data Segments”) associated with UIDs, cookies and/or mobile device advertising IDs. These Data Segments (whether created by us or others) may be based on your inferred interests (for instance, based on the ads you click on or sites and apps you view), or on inferred demographic categories (such age and gender).  For instance, if you visit a lot of travel websites, or install travel apps, we may associate you (e.g., your devices or browsers) with a Data Segment about ‘Travel.” Similarly, we sometimes use or work with Platforms that use UIDs or other information derived from information such as email hashes. This information may be associated with cookies and used to target ads to you that are based on “offline” interest-based segments, such as your interests, transactions or demographic information. 
  * We may work with Partners that create Data Segments based on precise location data (such as that collected from mobile applications), and share those Data Segments with us. For instance, if your device is often located at music venues, a Partner may put you in a segment for “Music Lovers” and tailor music ads to you. We may use these Data Segments, tied to UIDs or other Service Information. 

In addition, sometimes we may use health related Data Segments to help tailor ads. These Data Segments generally fall into the following categories: (1) occupation in a health related field, (2) health related topics and conditions (but not specific conditions), (3) interest in health insurance, (4) diet, fitness, weight-loss and healthy lifestyles, (5) consumer goods and services for personal healthcare, vision care, grooming and beauty, (6) over the counter medicines, remedies and dietary supplements, and (7) health related charities.  You can [click here](https://web.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TubeMogul_Health_Segments_Jul_29_2015.pdf) for a list of health related segments supplied by third party data companies that we and our clients may use to target ads using our platform. 

We may combine any or all of the Service Information, for the purposes we describe in this Policy.




### 3\. How We Use the Service Information We Collect

Generally speaking, we use the Service Information to help Clients and Partners optimize ads and make them more relevant to your interests, and to help marketers measure the effectiveness of ads – for instance, by measuring whether ads increase consumers’ purchases or web visits. Sometimes, we use the Service Information to help Clients and Partners understand more about their customers or certain audiences. Similarly, we sometimes use the Service Information to create Data Segments (also described above), which may be associated with cookies, mobile identifiers or other UIDs, and thus used to tailor, optimize and measure ads across browsers and other devices, such as tablets, smartphones and televisions. 

We (or Partners we work with) also may use the Service Information — for instance, IP addresses and UIDs — to try to locate the same unique users across multiple browsers or devices (such as smartphones, tablets, or other viewing devices), or work with Partners that do this, in order to better target ad campaigns to common sets of users. For instance, a brand may wish to target customers that it usually recognizes on web browsers through mobile apps. Similar, we may use the Service Information, in particular various UIDs, to sync cookies and identifiers with other Partners and Clients, in order to help them (or help our Clients) do any of the above. 

### 4\. Cookies, Pixel Tags & SDKs

We, our Partners and our Clients use various UIDs and technologies to tailor ads to Users across various media channels and devices. Among the most common of these technologies are cookies, pixel tags and mobile SDKs, and we’ve described each of those below. 

**a. Cookies and Pixel Tags**

Cookies are small data files containing a string of characters, such as unique browser identifiers. Cookies are stored on your computer or other device and act as unique tags that identify your browser. Cookies may be “session” or “persistent” cookies. Persistent cookies, unlike session cookies, remain after you close your browser, and may “remember” your browser on subsequent visits to a website or subsequent interactions with an ad platform, such as TubeMogul or our Partners. For instance, if you visit the TubeMogul Websites, we may work with a retargeting ad platform to send you ads about TubeMogul services and events when you visit other sites. 

This technology may also provide us (or any Partner or Client that has placed a cookie on your browser) with information regarding your IP address, browser type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or after you visit a given website, what pages you view on a site, and the dates and times of your visits. 

A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages. When you access a web page with a pixel tag, the pixel tag may generate a generic notice of the visit, and permit us, or our Clients or Partners, to set or read cookies. Pixel tags are used in combination with cookies to track the activity on a website by a particular browser on a particular device. If you disable cookies, pixel tags simply detect a given website visit. 

We, alone or with our Clients and Partners, may use cookies and pixel tags to “remember” you, track trends, and collect information about how you use our Clients’ or Partners’ websites or interact with advertising. We, and our Clients and Partners, use cookies to provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant ads with ads that are more likely to better match your interests. If you want to opt out of this type of “interest-based” advertising, please see Section 6 below, titled “Your Advertising Choices.” 

**b. Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs**

We, or our Clients or Partners, may use or work with mobile SDKs (including our own SDK(s), which are described in more detail in this Policy) to collect information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs), and information related to how mobile devices and their users interact with mobile apps. The SDK is (functionally) the mobile version of a cookie – it is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services to be implemented. 

### 5\. How and With Whom We Share the Service Information

Generally, we share the Service Information with Clients and Partners in order to provide the TubeMogul advertising platform and services. We may also share the Service Information with a variety of service providers to help us to improve our platform and the services we provide, develop new services, and provide, secure, monitor, operate and evaluate the services we offer. For instance (simply by way of example), we may share the Service Information with various service providers to (a) help us connect data we hold or services we offer with other platforms and other data, (b) enhance, maintain and protect the Service Information, (c) evaluate the accuracy of the Service Information, or (d) anonymize and aggregate the Service Information, or provide privacy-related protections. 

In particular, we share the Service Information with Clients and Partners to help marketers provide targeted content and advertising to End Users on mobile websites, apps and other devices such as TVs and to help measure the effectiveness of marketing or analyze Users’ likely interests or demographics. 

We may also share the Service Information with certain Partners to help advertisers identify common users across different mobile devices and/or mobile browsers. 

These processes often involve cookies or similar technologies, which may be associated with other information about End Users, such as End Users’ interests, demographics, or transactions. This is often known as “interest-based advertising.” We encourage individuals who are interested in controlling or learning about this type of advertising to go to Section 6 below, or to the DAA’s website at [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/). 

We may also share Service Information with third parties: 

  * Pursuant to a request or authorization by a User or Client,
  * If the disclosure is provided to: (a) comply in good faith with applicable laws, rules, regulations, governmental requests, court orders, or subpoenas,; (b) enforce our terms and conditions or other agreements; or (c) protect our, or any other person’s or entity’s, interests, rights, property, or safety, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual unlawful activity,
  * For a range of purposes, where the information is aggregated or de-identified, and
  * As part of a business purchase, sale, merger, consolidation, investment, change in control, transfer of all or substantially all of our assets, reorganization or liquidation, bankruptcy, or in connection with steps taken in anticipation of such an event (e.g. due diligence).



### 6\. Your Advertising Choices

There are a number of ways that you can “opt out” of receiving some or most interest-based advertising, including accessing the TubeMogul Opt Out. 

**a. The TubeMogul Opt Out**

If you prefer not to receive targeted ads in your web browser via our platform as described above you can opt out by clicking the link below: 

[](http://www.tubemogul.com/public/set_opt_out_cookie)

**b. Opting Out of Online Interest-Based Advertising**

Additionally, you may [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) to access the opt out page maintained by the Network Advertising Initiative, or NAI, You may [click here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) to access the opt out page maintained by the Digital Advertising Alliance, or DAA. And, you may [click here](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices) to access the opt out page maintained by the eDAA and [click here](http://www.youradchoices.ca/choices) to access the opt out page maintained by the DAAC. Each of the above are opt-out tools implemented and maintained by trusted industry associations, in order to enhance consumers’ advertising choices. This type of opt out is cookie-based, which means that if you replace or upgrade your browser, or delete your cookies, you will need to opt out again. Opting out in this way will not prevent you from receiving ads; rather, the ads you see will be less customized to you. 

If you use a cookie-based opt out – which includes all of the above, and the TubeMogul opt-out – and you later delete your cookies, use a different browser, upgrade your browser or buy a new computer, you will need to renew your opt-out choice. 

**c. Opting Out of Cross-App Advertising on Mobile Devices**

You can opt out from having your mobile advertising identifiers used for certain types of interest-based mobile advertising (also called “cross-app advertising”) by accessing the settings on your Apple or Android mobile device, as follows: 

  * Apple Devices: If you have an Apple device, you can opt out of most cross-app advertising by updating to iOS 6.0 or higher and setting Limit Ad Tracking to ‘ON.’ You can do this by clicking on Settings → General → About → Advertising, and toggling Limit Ad Tracking to ‘ON.’
  * Android Devices: If you have an Android device, you can opt out of most cross-app advertising by clicking on Google Settings Ads, and selecting the option to opt-out of interest-based ads.



Please note that these platforms control how these settings work, so the above instructions may change. If your device uses other platforms not described above, please check the settings for those devices. 

Also note that opting out through any of the above methods will not prevent you from seeing ads – it will only make ads that are served (whether by us or others) less likely to be relevant to or customized to your interests.
