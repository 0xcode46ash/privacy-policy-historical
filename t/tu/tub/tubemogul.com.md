# TubeMogul.com - Privacy & Security

**Our commitment**   
Simply put, we will never abuse your trust -- that means that we will never share, sell, rent or otherwise disclose any of your personal or company information without your explicit consent. 

To ensure the integrity of our privacy policy and to prevent unauthorized access to account information we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure your account information. All account information is encrypted and stored on our servers in the United States. 

**Passwords**   
Please don't give out or share your account password. If you forget your password go to the following webpage to be emailed a password reminder: [http://www.tubemogul.com/forgot.php](https://web.archive.org/web/20081227050112id_/http%3A//www.tubemogul.com/forgot.php). 

**Cookies and Data Collection**   
"Cookies" are inconsequentially small files placed on the hard drive of your computer. The cookies placed on your computer are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive once you log out or close your browser. We use cookies to provide you better service by allowing you to enter your password less frequently during a session and to help us understand and analyze our web page flow. 

We may combine your information with information we collect from other members (such as demographic data) to improve and personalize our services. 

**Spam**   
You may not use our communication tools to send spam. If you send an email to an email address that is not registered in our community (via Refer a Friend or other tool), we do not permanently store that email or use that email address for any marketing purposes. We do not rent or sell these email addresses. 

**Marketing**   
Again, we will never sell, rent or disclose your information to any third parties without your explicit consent. We may, but are not obliged to, occasionally send you strictly service or feature-related enhancement announcements. 

**Contact Us**   
Please contact us to report violations or if you have any questions regarding our Privacy & Security policy. You can reach us at [comments@tubemogul.com](mailto:comments@tubemogul.com).
