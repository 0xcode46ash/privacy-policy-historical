### Privacy Statement

TUSD respects the privacy of all visitors to the district web site at [www.tusd.k12.az.us](https://web.archive.org/web/20080629123133id_/http%3A//tusd1.org/index.htm) (also known as [www.tusd1.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20080629123133id_/http%3A//tusd1.org/index.htm)) and protects your privacy to the extent permitted by law. 

You can read and download information at the TUSD web site without identifying yourself or providing any personal information.

This privacy statement discloses what information this web site collects and how district employees use that information. The TUSD web site collects three types of information:

  * information you voluntarily provide through email messages, web forms, and surveys.
  * information automatically gathered through web visit logs.
  * information collected by network traffic logs.



**Voluntary Information**  
We do not collect any personal information about you unless you voluntarily choose to provide it to us by sending email, completing online forms, or filling out online surveys. You are not required to participate in any of these activities to view or download any information from our web site.

If you send an email message to the TUSD webmaster, your email message will be answered directly by the webmaster or forwarded to the TUSD employee best able to address your message. 

The following types of information may be requested by online forms:

  * Your name.
  * Your email address.
  * Your phone number.
  * Your affiliation with TUSD.
  * Comments or information solicited by the specific form.



**Note:** The [web site feedback form](https://web.archive.org/web/20080629123133id_/http%3A//tusd1.org/contents/feedback.html) may be filled out anonymously. Unless you choose to provide it, your email address will not be collected by completing this form. This form submits your responses through an anonymous account on our web server. 

Your responses to an online survey will be used to fulfill the purpose of that survey. 

Any personal information that you voluntarily provide to us through email messages, forms, or surveys will only be used to respond properly to your request. TUSD does not share, disclose, or sell email addresses or phone numbers to other organizations.

The TUSD web site automatically collects and stores the following standard information when you visit our web site:

  * The web pages you visited at our site.
  * The date and time you visited the site.
  * The web browser and operating system you used.
  * The Internet protocol address and domain name used to connect to our services.
  * The web site you visited prior to coming to this site.



This information is stored on our servers for the time necessary to perform site analysis and maintenance.

We analyze this information to help us understand how people use our web site so that we can improve its content, design, and services. This information is not personally identifiable, and we make no attempt to use it to identify individual web site visitors.

**Network Traffic Logs**  
To secure the district network and provide reliable service, TUSD uses software programs to monitor network traffic, scan for computer viruses, and identify attempts to access the network without authorization. Any information gathered through these activities, such as network-packet addresses or email-headers, is used solely for the purpose of maintaining network security. Personally identifiable information gathered through these activities is not released to other parties unless required by law.

**Cookies**  
The TUSD web site does not use cookies to track user information.

**Links to Other Sites**  
This web site provides links to other web sites. TUSD is not responsible for the privacy policies of other web sites, and TUSD's privacy statement does not apply when you visit these other sites. We recommend that you be aware when you leave our web site and encourage you to read the privacy statements of other web sites you visit. 

**Notification of Changes**  
We will post notification on the TUSD homepage when we make any revisions to the district web site privacy statement.
