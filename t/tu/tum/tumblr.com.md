# Tumblr

Our deepest thanks to [Automattic](http://www.automattic.com/) ([WordPress.com](http://www.wordpress.com/)) for making the following Privacy Policy available under a **Creative Commons Sharealike** license. You guys rock! 

We intend to modify our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service in the very near future to better reflect our philosophies and practices. But due to recent attention, we needed to get up some boilerplate. Thanks for your understanding! 

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Tumblr collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Tumblr’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Tumblr’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Tumblr may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. 

Tumblr also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Tumblr does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. 

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Tumblr’s websites choose to interact with Tumblr in ways that require Tumblr to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Tumblr gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at Tumblr.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Tumblr – by purchasing access to the Akismet comment spam prevention service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Tumblr collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Tumblr. Tumblr does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities. 

## Aggregated Statistics

Tumblr may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Tumblr may monitor the most popular blogs on the Tumblr.com site to help identify spam. Tumblr may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Tumblr does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. 

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Tumblr discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Tumblr’s behalf or to provide services available at Tumblr’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Tumblr’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Tumblr will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Tumblr discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Tumblr believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Tumblr, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Tumblr website and have supplied your email address, Tumblr may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Tumblr and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Tumblr takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information. 

## Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Tumblr uses cookies to help Tumblr identify and track visitors, their usage of Tumblr website, and their website access preferences. Tumblr visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Tumblr’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Tumblr’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies. 

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Tumblr may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Tumblr’s sole discretion. Tumblr encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a Tumblr.com account, you should also check your blog’s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
