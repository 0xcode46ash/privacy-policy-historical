# Privacy Policy

**Why did you receive a mailing from us?**

Our email marketing is permission based. If you received a mailing from us, our records  
indicate that (a) you have expressly shared this address for the purpose of receiving  
information in the future (“opt-in”), or (b) you have registered or purchased or otherwise  
have an existing relationship with us. We respect your time and attention by controlling  
the frequency of our mailings.

**How can you stop receiving email from us?**

Each email sent contains a link at the bottom to unsubscibe. Simply click on the link and we will stop sending you email.

**Sharing and Usage**

We will never share, sell, or rent individual personal information with anyone for their  
promotional use without your advance permission or unless ordered by a court of law.  
Information submitted to us is only available to employees managing this information for  
purposes of contacting you or sending you emails based on your request for information,  
and to contracted service providers for purposes of providing services relating to our  
communications with you.

**Use of Web Beacons**

When we send you emails, we may include a web beacon to allow us to determine the  
number of people who open our emails. When you click on a link in an email, we may  
record this individual response to allow us to customize our offerings to you. Web  
beacons collect only limited information, such as a cookie identifier, time and date of a  
page being viewed, and a description of the page on which the Web Beacon resides (the URL).

Web Beacons can be refused when delivered via email. If you do not wish to receive  
Web Beacons via email, you will need to disable HTML images or refuse HTML (select  
Text only) emails via your email software.

This policy was created in May 2008.
