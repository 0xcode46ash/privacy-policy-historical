Turnkey Internet's online privacy policy governs personal information gathered on our Internet sites ([www.turnkeyinternet.net](http://www.turnkeyinternet.net/), [www.turnkeyinet.net](http://www.turnkeyinet.net/) and their [affiliates ](http://www.turnkeyinternet/doc/CompanyDBAs.php)). 

**Turnkey Internet's Commitment to Online Security**   
Physical, electronic and managerial procedures have been employed to safeguard the security and integrity of personal information. Billing information is encrypted whenever transmitted or received online. Personal information is accessible only by staff or volunteers designated to handle online complaints or requests. All Turnkey Internet agents and contractors with access to personal information obtained on the Turnkey Internet web sites are also bound to adhere to this policy. 

**Personal Information that Turnkey Internet May Collect Online**   
Turnkey Internet collects the following types of personal information: names, postal and e-mail addresses, phone, IP (internet protocol) and facsimile numbers, billing information, and any necessary customer service information. Turnkey Internet may also collect business information from Agents and Resellers of our products and services which could constitute personal information, as well as personal information from individuals acting solely in their business capacity. 

Turnkey Internet does not collect or maintain information from those actually known to be under the age of 13, and no part of our sites are structured to attract anyone under the age of 13. 

**Turnkey Internet Uses Personal Information Collected Online**   
Unless you consent, we will not use your personal information for any purpose other than that for which it is submitted. We use personal information to reply to inquiries, handle complaints, provide operational notices and in program record-keeping. We also process billing and business requests related to program participation. At certain points where personal information is collected on our site, there may be a box where you may indicate you would like to be on a list to receive information about other Turnkey Internet products and services. This election box only appears in places where the department collecting personal information maintains such lists. At any time you can add or remove your name from a Turnkey Internet list by [contacting us](http://www.turnkeyinternet.net/contact_turnkeyinternet.php). 

**How Your Information May Be Shared**   
In order to provide quality customer service, Turnkey Internet may refer inquiries to our agents. For example, in providing a domain name registration, we may need to provide a 3rd party agent with the information necessary to register said domain name on your behalf. 

* We never sell or rent your personal information. 

Turnkey Internet may also release personal information to appropriate governmental authorities under the following circumstances: 

  * Where release is required by law (for example, a subpoena) or regulation, or is requested by a government agency conducting investigations or proceedings; 
  * Where our records indicate a company may be engaged in fraudulent activity or other deceptive practices that a governmental agency should be made aware of; 
  * Where your communication suggests possible harm to others. 



**Help Us Keep Your Personal Information Accurate**   
If your personal information changes, or you would like to review the personal information we may have on file, please e-mail us with the new information or your review request by [contacting us](http://www.turnkeyinternet.net/contact_turnkeyinternet.php). Let us also know the service program that led to your submission of personal information so we may efficiently locate your information. 

**Computer Tracking and Cookies**   
Our web sites are not set up to track, collect or distribute personal information not expressly entered by visitors. Our site logs do generate certain kinds of non-identifying site usage data, such as the number of hits and visits to our sites. This information is used for internal purposes by technical support staff to provide better services to the public and may also be provided to others; but again, these statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information. 

A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Turnkey Internet uses non-identifying cookies to provide easier site navigation and access to forms. You can still use the Turnkey Internet sites if your browser is set to reject cookies. Our cookies do not generate personal data, do not read personal data from your machine, and are _never_ tied to anything that could be used to identify you. 

**Problems or Complaints with Turnkey Internet on our Privacy Policy**   
If you have a complaint about Turnkey Internet compliance with this privacy policy, you may [contact us](http://www.turnkeyinternet.net/contact_turnkeyinternet.php)
