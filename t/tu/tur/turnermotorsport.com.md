**Children:** We do not wish to obtain personal information from children who are using our Site unsupervised. Thus, we ask children to obtain the consent of their parent or guardian before providing us with any personal information. 

**Cookies:  **Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and connection capabilities so that our Site can provide you with the optimal user experience.
