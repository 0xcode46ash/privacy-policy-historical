####  Who Do We Share Your Personal Information With?  Learn more >>

_Your_ personal information may be shared within the group of companies controlled by _Our_ parent company. 

In order to facilitate _Your_ travel arrangements, _We_ will often need to share _Your_ personal information with third parties including other airlines and airport operators, customs and immigration authorities, travel agents involved in making _Your_ travel arrangements, and _Our_ customer loyalty partners, such as when _You_ transfer between airlines or use a hotel. _We_ also share _Your_ personal information with third parties who deliver services either to _You_ or to _Us_ , such as companies that provide airport assistance or marketing agencies.

####  How Do We Protect Your Personal Information?  Learn more >>

_We_ are committed to ensuring the security and privacy of the personal data that customers provide. _We_ take every necessary measure available for the personal data provided to avoid the risks associated with their processing in order to protect the security of personal data and, specifically, to prevent their corruption, damage, or use by unauthorized third parties.

####  How Can You Keep Your Personal Information Safe and Secure?  Learn more >>

• _Keep Your booking reference confidential._  

When _You_ make a booking, _You_ will be given a booking reference such as a PNR (Passenger Name Record) and/or a ticket number. This will appear on the email confirmation or ticket of each person in _Your_ booking. _You_ should keep _Your_ booking reference confidential at all times. 

Giving _Your_ booking reference to others may allow them to access _Your_ booking details through _Our_ system. If _You_ are traveling with others and would not like _Your_ individual booking details to be accessible by them, _You_ may prefer to have each person make separate bookings, to be paid for individually. 

• _Keep Your loyalty scheme details (i.e. Miles &Smiles number/Registered Customer log-in details) confidential. _

To make sure _Your_ access to the _Online Channels_ is secure, _We_ recommend that customers avoid communicating passwords to others. When _You_ finish using the _Online Channels_ and/or social media accounts (especially if these accounts are linked together) _You_ should log out if others are able to access _Your_ computer or device, and especially when using a public device to access the web. This way, other users will not be able to access _Your_ personal data. 

• _Be aware of and protect yourself against Internet fraud and “phishing.”_  

There is an Internet fraud practice known as "phishing" which is the illegal gathering of personal information by deception. Unsolicited emails are sent to individuals from lists illegally gathered by a third party, and recipients are asked to enter or reconfirm bank or password details into a "cloned" or illegal copy web site. 

For _Your_ protection, please be aware of the following guidance: 

• _You_ will only be asked for _Your_ card payment details if _You_ wish to change or claim a refund of _Your_ booking on the _Online Channels_. _We_ require this information specifically in relation to _Your_ booking. _Our_ Customer Relations team might ask for _Your_ bank details if they are going to credit _Your_ account directly, after _You_ have raised a claim with _Us_.
