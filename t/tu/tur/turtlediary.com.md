As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, Turtlediary uses cookies to temporarily store information about you. A cookie is a small file on your own computer containing a string of characters that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to better display our website, to save you time, to provide better technical support, for advertising purposes, and to anonymously track website usage. For example, cookies help us to: 

  1. Keep track of whether you are signed in or have previously signed in so that we can display all the features that are available to you.
  2. Remember your settings on the pages you visit, so that we can display your preferred content the next time you visit.
  3. Know your username when you submit a technical support request so that you don't have to type it in.
  4. Advertise to potential customers on other websites around the web.
  5. Anonymously track website usage in the aggregate to help improve our services.

### How does Turtlediary use my information?

Turtlediary's goals in collecting personal information are to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our sites and a high level of technical support.

Turtlediary does research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, from our server log files, or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users; for instance, this information often gives us ideas for improving our products. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis.

### Who is collecting information?

When you are on the Turtlediary site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Turtlediary alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. If data is being collected or maintained by any company other than Turtlediary, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer.

* * *

As a general rule, Turtlediary will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. The following describes some of the reasons that your information may be disclosed.

Business Partners & Sponsors. Turtlediary will never disclose your personal information to business partners or sponsors, unless it is specifically described to you prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data. If personally identifying data about you will be shared, we will tell you before we collect or transfer the data. If Turtlediary becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Third Party Data & Data in the Aggregate. Under confidentiality agreements, Turtlediary may match user information with third party data. Also, Turtlediary discloses aggregated user statistics (for example, 8% of our users are from California) in order to describe our services to current and prospective partners and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.

Other. Turtlediary may release personal information if it has a good faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request; (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property, or safety of Turtlediary, its users, or the public as required or permitted by law.

You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. However, if you choose to reject all cookies you will be unable to use those Turtlediary services, which require registration in order to participate.

Turtlediary does not sell or rent user information to anyone. We will notify you at the time of data collection or transfer if your data will be shared with a third party and you will always have the option of not permitting the transfer. If you do not wish to allow your data to be shared, you can choose not to use a particular service.

### What is Turtlediary's policy on allowing me to update, correct, or delete my personally identifiable information?

You may edit your account information at any time by logging into your account and clicking the Account or Profile link. We recommend that you review your personal information periodically to ensure that it is accurate, complete, and current.

### What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage, and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.

Your registered accounts are password-protected so that you and only you have access to any personal information you have entered in your account. You may edit your account information at any time by logging into your account and clicking the Account or Profile link.

For your protection, remember to log out of all accounts before closing your browser. There is a log out link available on most Turtlediary pages. After logging out, make sure to close all browser windows. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information if you share a computer with someone else or are using a public computer.

We restrict access to personal information to Turtlediary employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

### How does Turtlediary Learning protect children's privacy?

Turtlediary does not ask a child under age 13 for more personal information, as a condition of participation, than is reasonably necessary to participate in a given activity. Turtlediary does not gather information on the ages of our users and will never knowingly share personally identifying information about users who are under the age of 13 with business partners or other third parties.

* * *

### What else should I know about my privacy?

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online (for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas) that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

Some Turtlediary services offer the option to show your name and e-mail address in various capacities. If you decide to show your name and e-mail address, you are making it available to others over the Internet.

Additionally, some Turtlediary services offer the ability to build custom Web pages or customize the content on a Web page. Just like any other Web-page building tool, the pages thus created can be accessed by anyone over the Internet. Please do not include any information on your Web page that you do not want to disclose over the Internet.
