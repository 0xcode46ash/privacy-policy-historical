### Turn2us Confidentiality Policy

Turn2us is bound by the UK’s Data Protection Act which implements the European Union (EU) Data Protection Directive. This protects personal data and places restrictions on Turn2us’s ability to disclose personal data within the UK and overseas.

Personal data is information relating to an individual from which they can be identified, e.g. name, address, tax details or national insurance number.

Turn2us staff will often be entrusted with personal information given to them in confidence by users of Turn2us services.  Anyone working for Turn2us has a duty to treat that information with respect.  They also have a duty under the Data Protection Act 1998 to protect the confidentiality of personal information and to process that information fairly.

#### **Data Protection Act**

The Data Protection Act regulates when and how an individual’s ‘personal data’ may be obtained, held, used, disclosed and generally processed. It applies to computerised processing of personal data and certain paper-based files and records.

To comply with the law, information must be collected and used fairly, stored securely and not disclosed to any other person unlawfully.

To do this, Turn2us staff must comply with the Data Protection Principles, which are set out in the Data Protection Act.  In summary, these state that personal data shall be:

  * processed fairly and lawfully and shall not be processed unless certain conditions are met
  * obtained for specified and lawful purposes and not further processed in a manner which is incompatible with that purpose
  * adequate, relevant and not excessive
  * accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date
  * kept for no longer than is necessary
  * processed in accordance with the data subject’s rights
  * protected by appropriate security
  * not transferred to a country outside the European Economic Area (EEA), unless that country has equivalent levels of protection for personal data.
  * [Back to top of page](https://web.archive.org/privacy_statement.aspx#Top)



#### **Requests by data subjects for access to data held**

If a user wishes to see any personal information about them held by Turn2us, this can be shown to him or her and a copy made if one is requested.  If a third party is acting on behalf of the user, proof of identity and the user's authority to disclose their information to their representative, must be obtained in writing. 

All requests must be responded to within 20 working days.

[Back to top of page](https://web.archive.org/privacy_statement.aspx#Top)

#### **Breaking confidentiality**

Confidentiality may be broken in the following circumstances:

  * Where the person from whom the information was obtained, and (if different) the person to whom it relates, consents
  * Where the information is already available to the public from other sources
  * Where the information is in the form of a summary or collection of information so framed that it is not possible to ascertain from it information relating to any particular person
  * When there is a serious risk of harm to the individual, as in a threatened suicide
  * To protect others.  For example, information about possible child abuse should be disclosed to the appropriate agency
  * To prevent a serious criminal act, especially where others may be endangered, for example an act of terrorism.  
There is no obligation in general to pass on knowledge of a crime.  However, it is a criminal offence to:



\- Deliberately mislead the police.  
\- To receive a reward of any kind in return for not notifying the police about a criminal act.  
\- Not to notify the police about an act that could be construed as an act of terrorism.  
\- Not to notify the police about an act that could be construed as drug trafficking.

If a member of Turn2us staff has to break confidentiality then the person whose personal information it is must be told that this is going to happen in writing.  The member of staff should only do so after all attempts to persuade the individual to disclose the information voluntarily have failed.  The Turn2us Head of Services should be consulted before disclosure. They will be responsible for making the final decision about breaching confidentiality and ensuring that the correct action is taken.
