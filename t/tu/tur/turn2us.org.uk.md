Why we need to collect information from you

We will notify you as to the types of information we are collecting about you as well as the uses we intend to make of that information. We may use the information we collect about you to notify you from time to time about important new features and changes to our online services or items we think you'll find of interest.

We ask you for your postcode on the Benefits Calculator. This is so that we can complete a benefits calculation based on your local authority. Your postcode will not be used for any other purpose, nor will it be shared with any third parties. It will be stored securely in our database for up to one year so that you may retrieve or change your benefits calculation during that time. We also ask for details such as Date of Birth and Employment status. This is solely for the purpose of calculating your benefit entitlement; the data which you enter is not used for any other purpose.

We ask you for your postcode on the grants search tool. This is so that we can provide search results based on your geographical location. Your postcode will not be used for any other purpose, nor will it be shared with any 3rd parties. We do not store postcodes from the Grants Search.

Subject to what we say below, we will not pass on your personal details to any third party, including site sponsors or advertisers, without your consent. In order to provide services to you we may need to provide your data to our agents and service providers.

We may provide aggregate statistics about our users, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to our third-party partners (if any), but these statistics will not contain any information about you from which you could be identified.
