**1  May 2005 **

What information do we store and Why? 

We store as little information as necessary to provide you with the services you receive from us. 

**Billing and Account Management** **  
** We store your name, telephone number and address and email details for billing and account management purposes. 

Piracy protection **  
** When you install Online Armor we take a non-identifiable fingerprint of your hardware. This is used soley to ensure you do not install Online Armor on more machines than your licence key permits. 

**Website  
**Our website and forums may use session cookies to enhance your browsing experience. These are not stored persistently, unless you request that the forum remembers your username and password. Session cookies and forum cookies are in no way linked with any other information we hold.  To prevent idiots from filling our forums full of nonsense, our forum software logs IP addresses.  These also don't identify you and aren't linked with anything outside of the forum system. 

**What do we do with this information?**  
We use information you provide as described above only. If you opt to allow anonymous information regarding the programs you block or trust to be shared with us, we store the following piece of information: 

  * A fingerprint of the program 
  * Whether or not it was trusted 
  * Version Information about the program 



None of this is linked to your account(s) in any way. It is not possible for Tall Emu or any other party to know what programs are running on your computer, but this information does help us understand which programs are being installed in aggregate by our users and prioritises our followup in testing programs for the trusted program list. 

**With whom do we share this information?**  
The only personal information that is shared with a third party is your payment details. We use Worldpay Inc. (A Royal Bank of Scotland Company) to provide a credit card payment facility. Tall Emu does not store your credit card details on its servers. 

**How do you access your information?**  
The only personal information we store about you relates to billing. If you need to change your information, send us an email from the email address we have on file and we will tell you what we have.  If your email address has been changed, unfortunately we will be unable to help you since we don't have enough other information to positively identify you. 

**How do we secure your information?**  
Your name name, telephone number and address and email details are stored in a database located behind our firewall and access is controlled by password. 

**How do we communicate with you?**  
We will communicate with you via email. It will be for the purpose of service announcements and/or billing reminders only.  We also communicate with our customers in the public forums.
