# Your Privacy in Talk City

* * *

It is Talk City's (and its parent studio, LiveWorld Productions') policy to use its best efforts to respect the privacy of its on-line visitors. Talk City does not use cookie technology to obtain any information from its on-line visitors. Talk City's cookie "lives" on your hard drive and keeps track of our predefined browser settings: tool bar off and music on, as well as demographic information, preferred client, and nickname. This allows us to optimize your on-line experience. 

We also track the total number of visitors to our site in an aggregate form (this means you're one of the bunch, your information isn't singled out) to allow us to update and improve our site, and tell other people something about the numbers of people who come to talkcity.com. Personally identifiable information is not extracted in this process. 

Talk City only collects personally identifiable data, such as names, addresses, email addresses, and the like, when voluntarily submitted by a visitor. We will use the information we collect from our members during the registration process only to make Talk City better and more responsive to users--to help us customize the service, and target advertising, sponsorships, and email offers based on our members' demographics, likes, dislikes, and affiliations. At our discretion we will make the information about Talk City's users available in aggregate form to help describe and identify our users to our partners, the industry and public at large, and our advertisers. **We will not share any detailed individual member information with other companies unless the member explicitly agrees to our doing so**. 

**Policies for Individuals 16 and Under**

No information should be submitted to or posted at Talk City's Web sites by children 16 years of age or under without their parent's or guardian's consent. Unless otherwise disclosed during its collection, Talk City does not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever. Talk City will not post anyone's email address unless they specifically give their permission, as in the "Make Friends" section of nickname and Home Page registration. Talk City encourages parents and guardians to spend time on-line with their children and to participate in the interactive activities offered on the sites.

**Information for Parents**

We make a special effort to advise kids to get parental permission before providing information or submitting stuff to put on-line, and we urge parents to supervise their kids' on-line use. Personally identifiable information may be collected in response to registrations, Talk City Home Pages, contest entry forms, subscribing to an email newsletter, etc. This information will be used by Talk City for internal purposes, and shared in aggregate form with our partners, advertiser and third parties. We offer an "unsubscribe" option if at any time they wish to cease receiving emails from Talk City. Any changes in these privacy policies by Talk City will be promptly communicated on this page. 

In the Talk City nickname and Home Page registration process, we have two clearly marked areas. Information entered on the first page will be kept private. Information on the second page (called Make Friends) will be shown on the person's web page and chat profile, so caution should be taken on what information is entered here. 

**Links to Other Sites**

We do our best to make sure that every link we have on this site works and sends you to a clean and well lit place on the World Wide Web. But because Web sites can change so quickly, we can't guarantee the content of every link from the places we link to (get it?). Young people: it's always a good idea to check with your parents or teacher before heading off to any new sites.
