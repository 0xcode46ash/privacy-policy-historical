### How Does Talbots Secure My Personal Information? 

Talbots takes substantial and appropriate security measures to help to safeguard your personal information and to prevent unauthorized access and disclosure.

Talbots has taken measures to ensure that shopping with us is a safe and enjoyable experience for our valued customers. We have a variety of current technologies, managerial safeguards, protocols and processes in place to protect the security and privacy of your personal information. Talbots.com uses Extended Validation Secure Sockets Layering (EVSSL) to encrypt your personal information including credit card information before it travels over the internet. EVSSL, issued by VeriSign® is the highest degree of authentication available and is only issued to qualified organizations and domains. If you are using a newer web browser (like Internet Explorer 7.0), you will see the browser bar turn green when accessing website pages secured by EVSSL. When you see the VeriSign® logo, click on it and you can validate that the website you are on is a Talbots website and verify our certificate is active.

We further protect your credit card number by only displaying the last 4 digits on the Order Confirmation page. In the unlikely event of credit card fraud at Talbots.com, the first $50.00 of your order will be covered. In most cases, credit card holders are not responsible for any charge beyond that amount, and we will work with your credit card company to resolve this issue.

We want you to feel confident whenever you visit us in our stores, on our website or otherwise. While we are focused on the security of your personal information and follow strict standards designed to protect such information, we cannot promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will remain secure in all circumstances.
