### What are My Choices About Behavioral Advertising? 

  


Like many retailers, Talbots contracts with third-party advertising networks to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. Advertising companies will typically collect anonymous information about a user's browsing activity, including the websites visited and the products viewed, and will then use that information to serve targeted advertisements. Although no personally identifiable information is collected in this way, some customers prefer not to receive this type of advertising.

Our website is not configured to respond to a "do not track" setting on your internet browser. However, many of Talbots marketing partners are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, and have agreed to honor consumers' opt-out preferences submitted through the NAI website.
