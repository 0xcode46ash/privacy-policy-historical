TalentWise, Inc. respects your right to privacy and we are committed to protecting it. This statement discloses the information practices for the web pages associated with the domain www.talentwise.com (the "website") and any applications, pages, or groups that are operated by us (the "Applications") on a social networking site such as Facebook, including what type of personal information we gather and track, how we use this personal information, and with whom we share the personal information.

Please note that this privacy policy, as it relates to our collection of information via our Applications, applies only to our Applications and not to your activities on the social networking site generally. Each social networking site's collection and use of your personal information when you use the social networking site is governed by that social networking site's privacy policy, which we ask that you also read and accept.

## Information Collection on Our Website

In general, you can visit our website without telling us who you are and without giving any personal information about yourself. However, you may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations. Personal information is collected only with your consent and may include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, social security number, date of birth, education and employment information, user id and password, information supplied in connection with applying for an account, any responses you choose to provide to survey questions, or any inquires you may make through our website. We do not share, sell, rent or trade personal information with third parties for their promotional purposes. The purpose of this Policy is to inform you of how we will use your information, before you provide it. If you tell us that you do not want us to use this information in this manner or to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes.

In connection with an authorized employment or tenant screening of an applicant, we collect personal information about the applicant. We use this information only for the purpose of performing the authorized screening, and conduct such screening in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. We do not use this information for any other purpose.

## Information Collection Via Social Networking Sites

If you use our Application on a social networking site, you allow us to access certain information from your profile from that social networking site. Please note that we use the term "Application" in the privacy policy to refer to groups, pages, and promotions we operate on social networking sites, including without limitation the TalentWise Facebook Page and associated Page Tabs, in addition to applications that are actually called "apps" and "applications". The information you allow us to access through an Application is affected by the privacy settings you establish at the social networking site. For example, we may access and store some or all of the following information, as allowed by you, the social networking site and your preferences:

  * Your "basic information" you have shared with everyone on the social networking site
  * Your profile picture or its URL
  * Your user ID number, which is linked to publicly available information such as name and profile photo
  * The login e-mail you provided to that social networking site when you registered
  * Your "friends" information
  * Other information indicated as part of the "Request for Permission" prompt from the social networking site



Your agreement to allow us to collect such information takes place when you "accept" or "allow" or "grant permission" (or similar terms) to one of our Applications on a social networking site.

When you use our Application on a social networking site, you may also provide personal information to us through the Application. For example, when you use our Application to enter a promotion, respond to a survey, or subscribe to one of our newsletters or lists, we may ask that you provide certain information, which may include your e-mail address or other personal information. When you provide information through the Application, you are providing this information to us, not to the social networking site.

## How We Use and Share Personal Information

The following paragraphs describe in more detail how we may use the personal information you provide to us and with whom we may share it.

To help us do this, we will share information with service providers to help us bring you the products and services we offer, either directly as the provider of such product or service, or indirectly such as financial institutions for credit card processing, email service providers, outsourced customer service providers, survey providers, or postal service providers. These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for any other purpose. We also require these third parties to maintain your personal information in the strictest confidence.

**Personal Information Disclosure: United States or Overseas.** Personal information submitted to TalentWise for a background screening investigation may at times be transferred outside of the United States and shared with 3rd parties in order to perform the background investigation. All personal information will be transmitted and stored in a secure manner in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer this website, to track users' movements around this website and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

**Third Party Monitoring.** In addition, service providers and other third parties such as advertisers may also use information gathering technologies on this website (including cookies and beacons) in connection with their services to collect anonymous information.

Unless you request that we don't, we may keep the information for future consideration.

## Cookies and Other Web Technologies

We collect non-identifiable information from visits to our websites to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity on TalentWise websites, but we do so in ways that keep our visitors' identities anonymous. TalentWise uses this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service.

We collect the information we mentioned in the previous paragraphs through the use of various technologies, including one called "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data that a website can send to your browser, which is then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. Some TalentWise pages use cookies, sent by TalentWise or its third party vendors, or other technologies to better serve you when you return to the website.
