## TalentWise Website

### Personal Information Collected from Website Visitors

In general, a visitor to the TalentWise Website (“you” or "Website Visitor") can visit the TalentWise Website without providing any personal information about yourself. However, you may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations, including when you submit an inquiry or create an account. Personal information that you choose to provide may include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, user id and password, company information, information supplied in connection with applying for an account including but not limited to credit card number, any responses you choose to provide to survey questions, or any inquires you may make through the TalentWise Website (collectively "Website Visitor Personal Information").

You may also provide personal information to us through web pages that we operate through third-party sites, such as social networking sites. For example, when you enter a promotion, respond to a survey, or subscribe to one of our newsletters or lists on our Facebook page, we may ask that you provide your e-mail address or other personal information. Please note that this Privacy Statement, as it relates to our collection of personal information via third party social networking sites, applies only to our direct collection of your personal information from you and not to your activities on the social networking site generally. Each social networking site's collection and use of your personal information when you use a particular social networking site is governed by that social networking site's Privacy Statement, which we ask that you also carefully review.

Like many websites, we and our third party partners also gather certain information automatically (including cookies and log files) when you visit the TalentWise Website. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and click stream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to better market our products and services, to analyze trends, to track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, to administer the TalentWise Website, to track users' movements around the TalentWise Website and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. For more information regarding our use of cookies, see below.

### How We Use and Share Website Visitor Personal Information

We may use Website Visitor Personal Information for the following purposes:

 **Fulfilling Your Requests.** If you request something from the TalentWise Website, for example, a product or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials, we will use the Website Visitor Personal Information you provide to fulfill your request. We may also use Website Visitor Personal Information to administer any promotions you enter with the official rules or other guidelines, information, restrictions, terms, or disclosures we publish related to the promotion.

 **Marketing.** We may use Website Visitor Personal Information for marketing and promotional purposes. Sometimes this information will be shared with a TalentWise partner as part of a joint marketing effort, event, or promotion. In those cases you may also receive promotional materials for their products or services as part of our collaborative marketing effort. Otherwise, TalentWise does not share or trade Website Visitor Personal Information with third parties for their promotional purposes. Further, TalentWise does not sell or rent Website Visitor Personal Information to third parties for any purpose. If you would prefer not to receive marketing communications from TalentWise or its partners, please contact us at [Email Preferences Center](http://mkto-m0018.com/Xik0VQF01000PN6lY009LI0) or by any of the methods listed below.

 **TalentWise Hiring.** In connection with a job application or inquiry to work at TalentWise, you may provide us with information about yourself, such as a resume or curriculum vitae. We use this information throughout TalentWise and our affiliates for the purpose of employment consideration or otherwise responding to your inquiry. Unless you request that we don't, we may consider you for future opportunities or positions.

We may share Website Visitor Personal Information with third parties only in the ways that are described below:

 **Service Providers.** We may share Website Visitor Personal Information with service providers to help us bring you the products and services we offer, such as financial institutions for credit card processing, email service providers, outsourced customer service providers, survey providers, or postal service providers. Some of these service providers may be located in the United States and in other jurisdictions that may not offer the same level of protection to your personal information as that provided by your home country. However, we require these third parties to use Website Visitor Personal Information only as instructed by us and for no other purpose. All Website Visitor Personal Information will be transmitted and stored in a secure manner in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Statement. To learn more about our policies and practices with respect to service providers, please contact us at [privacy@talentwise.com](mailto:privacy@talentwise.com) or by any of the methods listed below.

## Cookies and Other Web Technologies

Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by TalentWise and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics or service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

We use cookies for our TalentWise Website, to remember users' settings, or for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.

Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use Local Storage such as HTML 5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.

 **Third Party Tracking.** Service providers and other third parties such as advertisers may use information gathering technologies on the TalentWise Website (including cookies and beacons) to collect anonymous information in connection with their services. This information is controlled by the relevant affiliated company or third party and is not controlled by us; specifically, (i) such information is governed by the Privacy Statement and terms of use of the relevant other party and (ii) we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. You can generally opt-out of receiving personalized ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt-out pages on the [NAI website](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/?partnerId=1//#completed) (http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/?partnerId=1//#completed) and [DAA website](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) (http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). E.U. users can also visit [Your Online Choices](http://youronlinechoices.eu/) (http://youronlinechoices.eu/). Opting out does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the company or companies from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns. To opt out of Google Analytics, visit <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/>.

TalentWise does not currently commit to responding to browsers' Do Not Track ("DNT") signals with respect to the TalentWise Website, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. However, you do have the ability to opt-out of some of the tracking features on the TalentWise Website by using the links set out above.

## TalentWise Screening, Hiring, Onboarding and Other Services

### Candidate Personal Information Collected

We collect personal information from and about individuals ("Candidates") for the purpose of performing screening, hiring, onboarding, and other services (the "Services") for TalentWise's clients ("Service Requester") in accordance with applicable law, including the U.S. Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Personal information necessary to perform the Services is collected from the Service Requester, their Applicant Tracking System ("ATS"), or from the Candidate directly. We also will collect personal information about Candidates through the process of fulfilling the requested service. The data collected may vary depending on the type of service that is requested and limits imposed by applicable law. Such information may include name, date of birth, contact information, IP address, Social Security Number, government identification number or other personally identifying number, wage, tax, withholding, benefit or payroll information, address, education, employment history, credit and financial information, driving records, drug testing information, entitlement or authorization to work, criminal information and litigation history, sanctions, media or public records information to the extent permitted by applicable law, and name and signature from third party verifiers for electronic signature verification ("Candidate Personal Information").

### How We Use and Share Candidate Personal Information

We use Candidate Personal Information solely for the purpose of performing the requested service on behalf of the Service Requester, in accordance with applicable law. We do not use Candidate Personal Information for any other purpose. We have no direct relationship with the Candidates whose personal data we process. If you are a Candidate and would no longer like to be contacted by one of the Service Requesters that use our service, please contact the Service Requester that you interact with directly.

We may share Candidate Personal Information with the following and as described below. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Service Requesters.

 **Service Requesters.** We will share Candidate Personal Information provided to us, and obtained through fulfillment of the requested service, with the Service Requester. In some cases, we may share Candidate Personal Information through integration with the Service Requester's software platform or ATS.

 **Service Providers.** We may share Candidate Personal Information with service providers to help us perform the Services, such as to complete a particular search in the context of a screening investigation. All personal information will be transmitted and stored in a secure manner in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

 **International Transfers of Candidate Personal Information.** In performing international searches, Candidate Personal Information will be shared as necessary with third party service providers outside the Candidate's home country. Some of these service providers may be located in the United States and in other jurisdictions that may not offer the same level of protection to personal information as that provided by the Candidate's home country. However, we require these third parties to use Candidate Personal Information only as instructed by us and for no other purpose. All Candidate Personal Information will be transmitted and stored in a secure manner consistent with the terms of this Privacy Statement. To learn more about our policies and practices with respect to service providers outside of your country of residence, please e-mail us at [privacy@talentwise.com](mailto:privacy@talentwise.com).

**California Personal Information Disclosure: United States or Overseas.** Personal information submitted to TalentWise for a background screening investigation may at times be transferred outside of the United States and shared with 3rd party service providers in order to perform the background investigation. All personal information will be transmitted and stored in a secure manner in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

### E.U./Swiss Candidate Personal Information

TalentWise recognizes that the European Union and Switzerland have implemented "omnibus" data protection regimes established pursuant to the European Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, respectively. These laws require a legal basis for the transfer of certain individually identifiable data about individuals in European Union member countries and Switzerland to TalentWise in the United States. TalentWise maintains such a legal basis supporting transfers of personal data to the United States.

Additionally, TalentWise complies with the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor Principles and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles as developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Candidate Personal Information. TalentWise adheres to these Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. With respect to Candidate Personal Information collected from European Union member countries and Switzerland, the Service Requester acts as a data controller/owner and TalentWise acts a data processor of such information.

To learn more about the Safe Harbor Principles and to view TalentWise's certification under these Principles, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/eu/eg_main_018475.asp. Individuals with questions about European or Swiss Candidate Personal Information may first contact the Service Requester, as this may be the most efficient means of addressing such questions. For general questions about TalentWise's processing of European and Swiss Candidate Personal Information, you may e-mail us at [privacy@talentwise.com](mailto:privacy@talentwise.com) or contact us by any of the methods listed below. Any individual who cannot resolve an issue directly with the Service Requester or with TalentWise may contact [TRUSTe](https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request) using the contact information provided above.

### E.U./Swiss Service Requester Personal Information

As noted above, the European Union and Switzerland have implemented "omnibus" data protection regimes established pursuant to the European Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, even for Service Requesters. Similar to the legal basis for transfers of Candidate personal data, TalentWise maintains a legal basis supporting transfers of Service Requestor personal data to the United States.

Additionally, TalentWise complies with the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor Principles and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles as developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Service Requestor Personal Information.
