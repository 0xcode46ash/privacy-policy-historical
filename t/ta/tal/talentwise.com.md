## TalentWise Website

### Persona l Information Collected from Website Visitors

In general, you ("Website Visitor") can visit the TalentWise Website without providing any personal information about yourself. However, you may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations, including when you submit an inquiry or create an account. Personal information that you choose to provide may include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, user id and password, company information, information supplied in connection with applying for an account, any responses you choose to provide to survey questions, or any inquires you may make through the TalentWise Website ("Website Visitor Personal Information").

You may also provide personal information to us through web pages that we operate through third-party sites, such as social networking sites. For example, when you enter a promotion, respond to a survey, or subscribe to one of our newsletters or lists on our Facebook page, we may ask that you provide your e-mail address or other personal information. Please note that this Privacy Statement, as it relates to our collection of personal information via third party social networking sites, applies only to our direct collection of your personal information from you and not to your activities on the social networking site generally. Each social networking site's collection and use of your personal information when you use a particular social networking site is governed by that social networking site's Privacy Statement, which we ask that you also carefully review.

Like many websites, we and our third party partners also gather certain information automatically (including cookies and log files) when you visit the TalentWise Website. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and click stream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to better market our products and services, to analyze trends, to track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, to administer the TalentWise Website, to track users' movements around the TalentWise Website and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. For more information regarding our use of cookies, see below.

We may also use Website Visitor Personal Information to administer any promotions you enter with the official rules or other guidelines, information, restrictions, terms, or disclosures we publish related to the promotion.

 **Marketing.** We may use Website Visitor Personal Information for marketing and promotional purposes. Sometimes this information will be shared with a TalentWise partner as part of a joint marketing effort, event, or promotion. In those cases you may also receive promotional materials for their products or services as part of our collaborative marketing effort. Otherwise, TalentWise does not share or trade Website Visitor Personal Information with third parties for their promotional purposes. Further, TalentWise does not sell or rent Website Visitor Personal Information to third parties for any purpose. If you would prefer not to receive marketing communications from TalentWise or its partners, please contact us at [Email Preferences Center](http://mkto-m0018.com/Xik0VQF01000PN6lY009LI0) or by any of the methods listed below.

Unless you request that we don't, we may consider you for future opportunities or positions.

We may share Website Visitor Personal Information as follows and as described below:

 **Service Providers.** We may share Website Visitor Personal Information with service providers to help us bring you the products and services we offer, such as financial institutions for credit card processing, email service providers, outsourced customer service providers, survey providers, or postal service providers. Some of these service providers may be located in the United States and in other jurisdictions that may not offer the same level of protection to your personal information as that provided by your home country. However, we require these third parties to use Website Visitor Personal Information only as instructed by us and for no other purpose. All Website Visitor Personal Information will be transmitted and stored in a secure manner in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Statement. To learn more about our policies and practices with respect to service providers, please contact us at [privacy@talentwise.com](mailto:privacy@talentwise.com) or by any of the methods listed below.

## Cookies and Other Web Technologies

Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by TalentWise and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics or service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

We use cookies for our TalentWise Website, to remember users' settings, or for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.

We also use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 and Flash to collect and store information. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies visit: [http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flas hplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118).

 **Third Party Tracking.** Service providers and other third parties such as advertisers may use information gathering technologies on the TalentWise Website (including cookies and beacons) to collect anonymous information in connection with their services. This information is controlled by the relevant affiliated company or third party and is not controlled by us; specifically, (i) such information is governed by the Privacy Statement and terms of use of the relevant other party and (ii) we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. You can generally opt-out of receiving personalized ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt-out pages on the [NAI website](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/?partnerId=1//#completed) (http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/?partnerId=1//#completed) and [DAA website](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) (http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). E.U. users can also visit [Your Online Choices](http://youronlinechoices.eu/) (http://youronlinechoices.eu/). Opting out does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the company or companies from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns. To opt out of Google Analytics, visit <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/>.

TalentWise does not currently commit to responding to browsers' Do Not Track ("DNT") signals with respect to the TalentWise Website, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. However, you do have the ability to opt-out of some of the tracking features on the TalentWise Website by using the links set out above.
