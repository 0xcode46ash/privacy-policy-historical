\- Talentnow may correlate or match registered user information, including Personally Identifiable Information, with information held by our Business Partners to target ads or otherwise improve the effectiveness of our service.

If you consent to receive information from a Business Partner, through an opt-out process, Talentnow may pass your information to such Business Partners.

\- Talentnow may also offer goods or services for purchase available by our Business Partners. If you purchase goods or services offered through Talentnow by a Business Partner, then you may be required to submit Personally Identifiable Information in order to complete the transaction and Talentnow may provide your Personally Identifiable Information to such Business Partner for that purpose.

\- In some cases, we may enter into a promotional relationship with a Business Partner in which we prominently display their brand name or trademarks on pages that appear the same as or very similar to the pages of the Talentnow service. These pages are known as "Co-Branded Pages" and these particular Business Partners are known as "Co-Branded Business Partners."

\- If the page on which you submit information is a Co-Branded Page, or was accessed by clicking on a link on a Co-Branded Page, then we may share your personal information with the associated Co-Branded Business Partner.

Cookies : Talentnow wants to optimize your experience by ensuring that the most relevant information, searches and offers are displayed to you while using the Talentnow web site. A common manner in which to do this is by placing cookies on your computer. Cookies are strings of text and numbers that can identify your computer to us when you visit our site, and which may be correlated with your Personally Identifiable Information in our log files.

IPAddress: We log standard information such as your IP address along with the URL from which you came to our site and the URLs visited on our site, which may or may not contain some Personally Identifiable Information.

PixelTags: Talentnow uses pixel tags to gather information about the emails we send to our registered users and to recipients of messages. Pixel tags are tiny graphic files, not visible to the human eye, that are included in our HTML-encoded email messages. When such a message is opened in an HTML-capable email program, the recipient's computer will access our server to retrieve the pixel tag file, allowing us to record and store, along with your email address, the date and time the recipient viewed the invite or reminder, that the recipient's email program is capable of receiving HTML-encoded email, and other standard logging information. The pixel tag also may see or read cookies. For more information about cookies and how to disable their use, see the section below on "Use of Cookies."
