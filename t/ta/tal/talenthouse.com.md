# Talenthouse Privacy Policy | Talenthouse News

Last Updated: JUNE 18, 2009 

#### 1\. General

This Talenthouse, Inc. Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to the Site located at: www.talenthouse.com (the “Site”). Talenthouse, Inc. (“Talenthouse” or “our”) respects the privacy of its users whether they (a) simply view the Site; or (b) participate in the interactive programs that Talenthouse may make available from time to time on the Site. This Privacy Statement is intended to explain the conditions under which Talenthouse collects, uses and discloses that information, and your rights in relation to that information. By visiting our Site and/or using the products and services made available to you on the Site, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

#### 2\. Children

The Site is not directed to children under the age of 13, and Talenthouse will never knowingly collect Personally- Identifying Information (as defined in Section 3(A) below) from anyone whom it knows to be under the age of 13. We recommend that minors 13 years of age or older ask their parents for permission before using the Site or sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet. 

#### 3\. Gathering, Use and Disclosure of Non-Personally-Identifying Information

#### A. Gathering Non-Personally-Identifying Information from Users of the Site Generally

“Non–Personally–Identifying Information” is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person or entity. “Personally–Identifying Information,” by contrast, is information such as a name or email address that, without more, can be directly associated with a specific person or entity.

_i. Web Browsers_  
Like most Site operators, Talenthouse may gather from Site users Non-Personally-Identifying Information of the sort that Web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available. That information includes the user’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, operating system and browser type, and the locations of the Web pages the user views right before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving the Site. 

_ii. Cookies_  
A “Cookie” is a string of information that a Site stores on a user’s computer, and that the user’s browser provides to the Site each time the user submits a query to the site. Talenthouse uses Cookies to track the pages that users visit during each Site session. USERS WHO DO NOT WISH TO HAVE COOKIES PLACED ON THEIR COMPUTERS SHOULD SET THEIR BROWSERS TO REFUSE COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE SITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE SITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF COOKIES. SITE USERS WHO REFUSE WEB COOKIES ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.

_iii.Web Beacons_  
A “Web Beacon” is an object that is embedded in a web page. It is usually invisible to users but allows website operators to check whether a user has viewed a particular web page. Web Beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web Beacon resides. You may not decline Web Beacons, however, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. Third parties are not permitted to use Web Beacons on the Site.

#### B. Use of Non-Personally-Identifying Information

Talenthouse analyzes Non–Personally–Identifying Information gathered from users of the Site to help Talenthouse better understand how the Site is being used and to help improve users’ experience on the site. By identifying patterns and trends in usage, Talenthouse is able to better design the Site to improve users’ experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use. Talenthouse may link Non-Personally Identifying Information gathered using Cookies and Web Beacons with Personally-Identifying Information. 

#### C. Disclosure of Non-Personally-Identifying Information

From time to time, Talenthouse may also release the Non–Personally–Identifying Information gathered from Site users in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Site.

#### 4\. Gathering, Use and Disclosure of Personally-Identifying Information

A. Gathering Personally-Identifying Information from Users of the Site Generally As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information is information that can be directly associated with a specific person. Talenthouse collects a range of Personally-Identifying Information from and about Site users. Much of this is information provided by users themselves when they register with the Site, create a profile and use the services on the Site. Site users are under no obligation to provide Talenthouse with Personally–Identifying Information of any kind, with the caveat that a user’s refusal to do so may prevent the user from using certain Site features. BY REGISTERING WITH THE SITE, YOU CONSENT TO THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONALLY– IDENTIFYING INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS “GATHERING, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY–IDENTIFYING INFORMATION” SECTION. 

_i. Opting Out of Displaying your Age and Modifying Your Profile_  
A user’s Personally-Identifying Information may be publicly available through a user’s profile or user ID display. Profile or user ID display may allow other users to see a user’s activities, including purchase and sales content, ratings, and comments. Users may elect not to publicly display their ages at any time by configuring your personal profile to indicate that you want to make your age private. You may review and revise your profile information at any time.

#### B. Use of Personally-Identifying Information

Talenthouse may use the Personally-Identifying Information a user submits for any purposes related to Talenthouse’s business, including, but not limited to providing you with the service and personalizing the service for you. 

#### C. Disclosure of Personally-Identifying Information

As described in Section 4(A) “Gathering Personally–Identifying Information,” users may, at their option, disclose their own Personally-Identifying Information by any means they choose. Talenthouse will also disclose Personally-Identifying Information in the following circumstances:

_i. Third Party Service Providers_  
Talenthouse will disclose Personally–Identifying Information to those Talenthouse employees, contractors, affiliates, vendors, creative challenge sponsors, creative invite sponsors and suppliers who process Personally–Identifying Information on Talenthouse’s behalf or participate with Talenthouse in the provision or operation of the Site. 

_ii. On-line Forums and Blogs, Project Web Services and Developer Web Services_  
You may post Personally-Identifying Information on areas of the Site that may be viewed by other users or the public, although we recommend that you not do so. We urge you to use good judgment and not post Personally-Identifying Information that you do not want other users to know. YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS OF PRIVACY OR OTHER HARM RESULTING FROM YOUR VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION. 

_iii. DMCA Infringement Notifications, Notices of Violations of Site Terms of Service and_  
Other Communications Directed to Talenthouse By submitting a Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice (“[DMCA Notice](https://web.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Talenthouse_DMCA_Notice_and_Counter_Notice.pdf)“) or other communications about content stored on or transmitted through the Site) you consent to have such communication forwarded to the person or entity who stored or transmitted the content addressed by your communication, in order to attempt to resolve the dispute. For notices regarding violations of the Site’s Terms of Use agreement or other communications (but not DMCA Notices), upon request Talenthouse will edit out your name and contact information. However, DMCA Notices (including any Personally-Identifiable Information included in the DMCA Notice) will be forwarded as submitted to Talenthouse without any deletions. 

_iv. By Law or to Protect Rights_  
Talenthouse discloses Personally–Identifying Information, without notice to you, when required to do so by law, or in response to a subpoena or court order, or when Talenthouse believes in its sole discretion that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Talenthouse, other users, third parties or the public at large. 

_v. Business Transfers; Bankruptcy_  
Talenthouse reserves the right to transfer all Personally-Identifying Information in its possession to a successor organization or acquirer in the event of a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of Talenthouse’s assets. Other than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and disclosure of all transferred Personally–Identifying Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy, or to a new privacy policy if you are given notice of that new privacy policy and affirmatively opt-in to accept it. Personally-Identifying Information submitted or collected after a transfer, however, will be subject to any new privacy policy adopted by the successor organization. 

_vi. Surveys_  
From time to time, Talenthouse may also ask users to participate in surveys. Talenthouse will only disclose Non- Personally-Identifying Information collected by means of a survey in the aggregate, unless Talenthouse notifies users that Talenthouse will disclose Personally-Identifying Information collected by means of a survey at the time they take the survey in which case Talenthouse may disclose such Personally-Identifying Information. 

_viii. Talenthouse Email Service_  
Users may have the opportunity to use a service to send electronic mail to another Talenthouse user or email list. In such cases, a user’s valid email address and real name will be included with such messages. In order to prevent abuse, users may not opt out of such a display, but may choose to refrain from using such service to transmit an email message. 

_ix. Security_  
Talenthouse takes reasonable precautions to protect the security of users’ information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your Personally-Identifying Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

_x. Contests, Giveaways and other Promotions_  
Talenthouse may offer Site users the opportunity to participate in contests, sweepstakes, giveaways and other promotions (collectively, “Contests”). Any entries and information, including Personally-Identifying Information, submitted in connection with Contests may be publicly disclosed. You will not be required to participate in any Contests. 

_xi. Email to Friends Feature_  
Talenthouse may offer users the ability to send emails to friends. If you choose to use this feature, Talenthouse will only use your friends’ email addresses to send the requested emails to your friends. 

_xii. Uploading Personal Information to Third Party Sites_  
Talenthouse may enable you to migrate Personally-Identifying Information from Talenthouse to websites operated by third parties (“Third Party Sites”), including without limitation social networking websites. If you choose to use this option, Talenthouse will disclose your Personally-Identifying Information to those Third Party Sites. 

_xiii. Marketing Communications._  
If you opt in to receive marketing emails from us, Talenthouse will email you about products and services that we believe may be of interest to you. If you opt in to receive marketing emails from third parties, Talenthouse will provide your Personally-Identifying Information to third parties, so that those third parties may directly contact you about additional products and services. If you wish to opt out of receiving marketing emails from us or third parties, please follow the instructions at the bottom of each email. 

#### 5\. Collection and Use of Information by Third Parties

The Site contains links to Third Party Sites and may permit you to post content including Personally-Identifying Information, to Third Party Sites subject to the Third Party Sites’ own privacy policies. Because Third Party Sites are not operated by Talenthouse, Talenthouse is not responsible for the content or practices of such Third Party Sites. The availability of links to Third Party Sites on the Site does not represent, warrant or imply that Talenthouse endorses any Third Party Site or any materials, opinions, goods or services available thereby. These Third Party Sites may ask you for Personally-Identifying Information. Talenthouse is not responsible for any information these Sites may obtain. Talenthouse does not oversee their policies or practices in collecting Personally-Identifying Information, and their privacy policies may differ from this Privacy Policy. If you choose to visit Third Party Sites, please review each Third Party Site’s privacy policy to make sure you understand how your Personally-Identifying Information and Non-Personally-Identifying Information may be used and shared with third parties. 

#### 6\. Changes to the Privacy Policy

Technology and the Internet are rapidly changing. Talenthouse therefore is likely to make changes to the Site in the future and as a consequence will need to revise this Privacy Policy to reflect those changes. When we revise the Privacy Policy, Talenthouse will post a notice advising you of the revision on the home page to the Site for 30 consecutive days. For users for whom Talenthouse maintains an email address, Talenthouse will email you a copy of the revised Privacy Policy at your most recently provided email address. It is therefore important that you update your email address if it changes. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically for an up-to-date understanding of Talenthouse’s policies and practices.
