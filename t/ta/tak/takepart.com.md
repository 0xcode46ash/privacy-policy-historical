## Privacy Policy

**Effective November 5, 2007:**

We value your privacy and are committed to respecting the privacy rights of all users of www.takepart.com or its mobile version and any of its sub-domains (collectively, the “Site”) and the services, products and networks found at or related to the Site (collectively, the “Service”). The Site and Service are owned and operated by Participant Media, LLC and its corporate affiliates (collectively referred to herein as “Takepart.com”). This Privacy Policy covers how Takepart.com treats the personal information it collects and receives and is designed to help you make informed decisions when using the Site and Service. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies or web sites that Takepart.com does not own, control or is affiliated with or to people it does not employ or manage.

Takepart.com cares deeply about online privacy. If you have any questions concerning this Privacy Policy, please email us at privacy@takepart.com.

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to Takepart.com’s Terms of Use. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use, please do not provide Takepart.com with any information and do not use the Site or Service.

 **Information Collection and Use by Takepart.com**

In connection with certain portions of the Site and Services, Takepart.com allows members to set up unique personal profiles that can be linked together through networks of friends and organizations. Takepart.com members can view each others' profiles, communicate with each other, share photos and videos, post journals and comments, and describe their interests. Takepart.com members can change their profile information at any time and can control how other members and the Service communicates with them.

When you sign up as a member or for any other service or promotion that requires registration, Takepart.com will ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an account password). Takepart.com collects such submitted personal information to authenticate members and to send notifications to those members relating to the Service. Takepart.com also may collect other profile data including but not limited to: personal interests, gender, age, education and occupation in order to assist members in finding and communicating with each other.

Member profile information, including without limitation photos, is displayed to people in order to facilitate interaction in the Takepart.com community. Email addresses are used for the purposes of inviting new friends to join Takepart.com, to add users to members' friends' networks, and to send notifications related to the Service and Takepart.com. With the exception of inviting friends, adding friends, and notifications, a member’s email address is not shared or displayed to people within a personal network. Members within a personal network communicate on the Site with each other through the Service, without disclosing their email addresses. Members' full names are never directly revealed to other members. To facilitate searching and finding friends and acquaintances on the Service, Takepart.com allows users to search for members using first and last name, email address, and schools and/or companies where users may have attended or worked.

When you post User Content (as defined in the Terms of Use) on the Site you do so at your own risk. Takepart.com cannot control the actions of other members with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that User Content you post on the Site will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Users have copied or stored your User Content.

Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily post public information to blogs, message boards, chat rooms or any other public forums such information can be accessed by the public and can in turn be used by those people to send you unsolicited communications.

Takepart.com may also log non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from users and members of the Site. This data is used to manage the Site, track usage and improve the Service. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes. This non-personally-identifiable aggregated information, such as the number of users that clicked on a particular link, may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to members. Such information does not identify you individually.

From time to time, Takepart.com or a partner may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on the Site. Users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. We may transfer personal information to certain ad partners from whom you have explicitly requested to receive information. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy policy will apply.

Takepart.com is a general audience site and does not knowingly collect or solicit or intend to collect any personal information from anyone under 14 years of age. If you are under 14, please do not attempt to register on the Site or send any personal information about yourself. No one under age 14 may provide any personal information on the Site. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 14 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 14, please contact us at privacy@takepart.com.

 **Invitations and Other Communications to Non-members**

Takepart.com members can invite friends to join the Service by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system. Takepart.com stores the email addresses that members provide so that the respondents may be added to the friend's list of the members sending the invitations, and also to send reminders of the invitations. Takepart.com does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations, invitation reminders (up to three (3) per email address). Recipients of invitations from Takepart.com may contact Takepart.com to request the removal of their information from our database.

Takepart.com members may also store email addresses of people they know in their internal Takepart.com address book and may also choose to send invitations and other communications to those addresses.

You may prevent Takepart.com email invitations and other messages from being sent to any email address you control by sending a single email with the subject "BLOCK" to privacy@takepart.com. Please note that the email must come from the account you wish to block.
