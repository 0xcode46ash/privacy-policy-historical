**Ordering Online**  
Any data you submit to us through an online order form is transferred to us via a Secure Sockets Layer -- an encryption protocol -- and is kept in databases that cannot be accessed from outside our firewall. 

In other words, any data you send us is encrypted, so in the unlikely event a hacker intercepts your data, it cannot be easily read. Our firewall is a mechanism that prevents access to our servers by anyone outside of the company.

_Taipan Publishing Group_ does not sell or rent your name to anyone. That means that only authorized employees of _Taipan_ ever have access to any information you submit. We may use your name and address to send you information on other _Taipan Publishing Group_ products that may suit your interests.
