# Privacy Policy - Tango - FREE voice, video, & text over 3G, 4G, & WiFi!

## Introduction

This is the Privacy Policy of TangoMe, Inc. dba Tango (“Tango”, “us”, “we”, or “our”) and is incorporated into and is subject to our Terms of Use which can be found at <http://www.tango.me/terms-of-use>.  In this Privacy Policy, we refer to our products and services as the “Service.”  Please read on to learn more about our data handling practices. Your use of the Service signifies that you agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not use the Service.

## Information We Collect

When you install the Service on your device and register with Tango, personally identifiable information about you may be collected during the download process for the Service (as requested from you during the download process) when you register with us.  For registration through Tango, you are only required to provide your mobile phone number or your email address, depending on the device(s) you are using on the Service.  You may also provide personally identifiable information, but that is optional.  When you log in using your Facebook account, we may collect additional information you make available to us (see “Your User Profile”) below.

In addition, when you install the Service on your device and register with Tango, you will be asked to allow us access to your address book.  If you consent, we will have access to contact information in your address book on the devices you use for the Service (names, numbers, emails, and Facebook ID, but not notes or other personal information in your address book) and we will store it on our servers and use it to help you use the Service, for example, by synchronizing your Tango contacts between different devices you may want to use with the Service.  If you do not want Tango to store this information, you may opt-out through your account settings in the Tango application at any time. However we may not be able to offer some of the features that require this information.

Tango may also collect and gather non-personally identifiable information, such as certain profile information including country of residence and preferences. In addition, Tango may collect and store information about your and others’ usage of and interaction with the Service and our websites, including calls, numbers of calls made by members, call durations, text messages, information relating to games played through the Service (such as the games played, your game scores and how often you play), usage by geographies, device and connection information, IP address, device capability, bandwidth, statistics on page views, network type and traffic to and from our websites.

Tango allows you to share text messages, photos, videos and other communications (such as greeting cards or interactions during games) in the Tango application with other users, and if you choose to do so your text messages, photos, videos and other communications will be stored on our servers.  In addition, if you choose to share these items with other Tango users, we may not be able to remove them from our servers or make them unavailable to anyone you have shared them with.  Sending text messages, photos, videos or other communications in the Tango application is your decision.  By choosing to share that information, you should understand that you may no longer be able to control how that information is used and that it may become publicly available (depending in part on your actions or the actions of others with whom you have shared the information). Tango is not responsible for any use or misuse of information you share.

## How We Use Information We Collect

We use or may disclose your personal information only as follows:

  * To verify your identity;
  * To connect you with your friends, family and others as enabled by the Service;
  * To share your Profile with your friends, family and others on the Service;
  * To allow your use of certain features of the Service that may be offered from time to time (such as Premium Services (see our Terms of Use), games, greeting cards, animations, etc.);

  * To deliver to you any administrative notices, alerts and communications relevant to your use of the Service;

  * For internal operations, including troubleshooting problems, data analysis, testing, research, improvements to the Service, detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other illegal activity;
  * When we have a good faith belief that the law, any legal process, law enforcement, national security or issue of public importance requires disclosure;

## Your User Profile

The information you enter into your user profile (your “Profile”) may be shared with your Tango contacts. You control your Profile and you can access and modify your Profile from the Tango application at any time.  In addition, if you register with Tango using your Facebook account (e.g. Facebook Connect), we may store your Facebook ID and corresponding token on our servers and, if you give us your express consent, we will have access to and may collect certain information that you make available on Facebook (for example, your first and last names, email address, profile picture, your friend lists and birthdays).  Your Profile is available to other users of the Service who are connected to you on Tango.  In addition, unless you opt-out (which you may do at any time in the Tango application), your Profile is discoverable by other Tango users, including by way of example in listings of contacts that will include your proximity to other users (however, Tango will not share your location with any users).  You may also “block out” any Tango user in your contact list from discovering your Profile at any time.  In addition, Tango may pre-populate your Profile with certain information such as your name and Facebook profile picture if you or your friends have logged onto the Service using Facebook.

## Data Access and Removal

You can remove your data anytime you want.  If you ask us to delete your account, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to remove your data from our servers.

Any personally identifiable information that (i) you share in text messages, photos, videos or otherwise in or through the Tango application with other users, or (ii) submit on a blog, bulletin board or chat room on our website or elsewhere, can be viewed and used by others, including to send you unsolicited messages or to commit identity theft. Tango is not responsible for any use or misuse of your information that might result from your disclosure of information.

## Service Providers

In certain instances, Tango may have contracts with third parties to provide products and/or services in connection with the Service.  In those cases, Tango may share your personal information with Tango’s third-party service providers, but only in connection with providing the services to you.  For example, Tango shares your phone number or email with third party SMS and email providers to deliver the authentication SMS or email to you when you register with Tango.  We contractually require that these third parties use your information solely to deliver SMS or email to you and to use appropriate security measures to protect your information. In addition, certain Tango servers are owned and hosted by third party service providers.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third party service providers.

## Outbound Links

If you accessed a website, product or service provided by a third party, including through the Service or a Tango website, such third party may also collect information about you. Please see the privacy policies of each such third party for more information about how they use the information they collect. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any exchange of information between you and any third party.

## Opt-Out – Promotional Communications

Tango allows you to choose not to receive promotional email messages from Tango and its service providers. You may opt-out by following instructions in the message sent by Tango or its service providers on how to unsubscribe from that particular mailing.  You may also opt-out by contacting us at privacy@tango.me.

## Security

Protecting user privacy and personal information is a top priority for Tango. We make substantial efforts to ensure the privacy of all personally identifiable information you provide to us. Access to all personally identifiable information is restricted to those Tango employees, contractors, agents and third-party service providers who need to know that information in order to provide, operate, develop, maintain, support or improve the Service.  Tango uses password protection, access logs, and system monitoring to safeguard the confidentiality and security of all member information.

In addition, due to the inherent nature of the Internet and related technology, we do not guarantee the protection of information under our control against loss, misuse or alteration.

## Data Transfer

Your information may be stored and processed in any country in which Tango maintains facilities, including outside of the United States. In this regard, or for purposes of sharing or disclosing data as described in this Privacy Policy, Tango reserves the right to transfer information outside of your country. By using the Service, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.  In addition, by using the Service (which is governed by California law, this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use), you consent to be governed by California law for these purposes and in connection with your use of the Service.

## Age

The Service is not directed to children under the age of thirteen (13) and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Service. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of thirteen as part of the Service, we will delete such information from our records. If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Service.

## Notification of Changes

We reserve the right at our discretion to make changes to this Privacy Policy. You may review updates to our Privacy Policy at any time via links on our website. You agree to accept electronic communications and/or postings of a revised Privacy Policy on the Tango web site, and you agree that such electronic communications or postings constitute notice to you of the Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to modify this policy from time to time, so please review it frequently.

If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you by publishing a revised Privacy Policy or by means of a notice on our website, or as required by law. You agree to review the Privacy Policy periodically so that you are aware of any modifications.  You agree that your continued use of the Service after we publish a revised Privacy Policy or provide a notice on our website constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
