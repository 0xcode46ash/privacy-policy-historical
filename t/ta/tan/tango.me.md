## Security; Data Transfer

Protecting user privacy and personal information is a top priority for Tango. We make substantial efforts to ensure the privacy of all personally identifiable information you provide to us. Access to all user information is restricted to Tango employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve the Service. Tango uses password protection, access logs, and system monitoring to safeguard the confidentiality of all user information. Nonetheless, due to the inherent nature of the Internet and related technology, we do not guarantee the protection of information under our control against loss, misuse or alteration. In addition, your information may be stored and processed in any country in which Tango maintains facilities, including outside of the United States. In this regard, or for purposes of sharing or disclosing data as described in this Privacy Policy, Tango reserves the right to transfer information outside of your country. By using the Service, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. As Tango continues to develop its business, Tango might sell or buy subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions as well as in the event Tango or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, personal information of Tango users will generally be one of the transferred business assets. We reserve the right to include your personal information, collected as an asset, in any such transfer to a third party.

The Service is not directed to children under the age of thirteen and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Service. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of thirteen as part of the Service, we will delete such information from our records. If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Service.
