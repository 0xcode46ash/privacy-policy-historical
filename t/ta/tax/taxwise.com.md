# Universal Tax Systems, Inc. Privacy Statement

Universal Tax Systems, Inc.
Privacy Statement
December 2006
Universal Tax Systems, Inc. (“UTS”) makes it a top priority to protect your privacy and the confidentiality of
the personal information you enter into TaxWise.com or provide to us offline via guest registration cards or
otherwise. UTS takes the following position regarding your rights to privacy and confidentiality. Please read
this statement carefully and refer to it whenever necessary. If you have any questions, please contact the
UTS Legal department at: UTS Legal Department, 6 Mathis Drive, NW, Rome, Georgia, 30165 or by e-mail
at legal@taxwise.com or at 706-625-7757.
UTS wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy. This Privacy Statement discloses the privacy
practices for UTS and TaxWise.com, including:
      1.   What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personal identification is collected
           from you through our website and otherwise;
      2.   How the information is used;
      3.   With whom the information may be shared;
      4.   What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information;
      5.   The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of
           information under UTS’ control; and
      6.   How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.
While the nature of our business and its websites is strictly financial and are not designed to appeal to
children under the age of 13, we do believe that protecting the privacy of the very young is especially
important. For that reason, we do not knowingly attempt to solicit or receive any information from children.
Information Collection and Use
Universal Tax Systems, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected by UTS. UTS collects information
from our users at several different points on our web site as well as through guest registration cards and
various other means. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in any way that differs from
what is disclosed in this statement.
When filing tax returns electronically, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) requires UTS to provide the
Internet Protocol (“IP”) address of the computer from which the return originated as a method for detecting
fraudulent information being transmitted via the Internet. UTS is also required to inform the IRS if the e-mail
address of the person electronically filing the returns has been collected.
Registration
In order to access advanced support options online at TaxWise.com, a user must first complete the user
login form. During this login process a user is required to give his/her Client ID, EFIN and registration code.
This information is used to identify the user before he/she accesses the advanced support options. The
user is required to provide this information when accessing advanced support options so that we can
provide a more personalized support experience.
Ordering
On our order form, we request various information from a user. Here a user must provide contact information
(such as name and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration
date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill the customers’ order(s). If we experience
difficulty while processing an order, the contact information is used to contact the user. Use of all TaxWise
products is subject to the terms and conditions of the then current UTS Software License Agreement.
Please see additional information here.
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file that is placed on a user’s hard drive by a web page server. Cookies cannot be
used to run programs, deliver viruses to your computer, or extract personal information from your computer.
The cookies we assign to you are unique, and can only be read by our web servers. Cookies can provide
our users with a more personalized and convenient visit to TaxWise.com. For instance, by setting a cookie
on our site, the user may not have to reenter their username multiple times, thereby saving time while on our


site. However, a user can still use our site if they reject the cookie. Cookies may also enable us to track and
target the interests of our users in order to enhance the experience customers have while on our site.
Log Files
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer our site, track user’s movement, and gather broad
demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable
information.
Sharing
We process credit card transactions directly with Paymentech Merchant Services, Inc. for all billed goods
and services. Paymentech Merchant Services, Inc. does not retain, share, store or use personally
identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
We partner with other third party companies to provide specific services such as bank products. When the
user signs up for these services we will share their names, or other contact information that is necessary for
the third party to provide these services.
These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information for any purpose other than providing
these services.
Except as set forth in this Privacy Statement, personally identifiable information is not otherwise released by
UTS to outside parties unless required by law or legal process (for example, subpoena). UTS reserves the
right to make exceptions to this policy in exceptional circumstances (such as suspected illegal activity) on a
case by case basis and at the sole discretion of UTS. UTS abides by applicable laws and regulations
governing the disclosure of information to governmental agencies. When responding to legal process
served on UTS by non-government agencies, unless otherwise ordered, the policy of UTS is to make
reasonable efforts to notify the affected customers in advance of releasing requested information and to
provide customers the opportunity to pursue available legal protection.
Links
TaxWise.com contains links to other websites. Please be aware that UTS is not responsible for the privacy
practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the
privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy
statement applies solely to information collected by TaxWise.com and no other sites.
Newsletter
We provide users the opportunity to receive newsletters via e-mail. If a user wishes to subscribe to our
newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and e-mail address.
Choice/Opt-out
Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter may opt-out of receiving these communications by using
the unsubscribe option in the newsletter email or by contacting Marketing at marketing@taxwise.com.
Surveys & Contests
From time-to-time we request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys
or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this
information. Information requested may include contact information (such as your name and shipping
address), and demographic information (such as zip code, business size, etc.). Contact information will be
used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey (demographic) information will be used for the
purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of our site, products and/or services. Our
surveys and contests may have separate rules other than those listed above. We will identify how the
information users supply may be used in each such individual case.
Security
UTS takes strong precautions to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information to
UTS via the web site or otherwise, their information is protected both on-line and off-line.
When our return query form asks users to enter sensitive information such as a social security number, that
information is protected with encryption software that sets the Internet standard for secure transactions –
Secure Sockets Layer technology (“SSL”). While on a secure page the lock icon on the bottom of web
browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked or open, when you


are just ‘surfing’.    To learn more about SSL and TaxWise.com security measures, see our Security
Statement.
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also take strong precautions to
protect our users’ information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information
mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who require the information to perform a
specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer support representative) are granted access to
personally identifiable information. Our employees must record the instance in your records each time your
information is accessed. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy
practices. On an ongoing basis, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified
and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy and what they can do to ensure our users’
information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a
secure environment, in a limited access room inside a locked case.
Site and Service Updates
From time to time we may send the user announcements regarding site and customer service updates.
Members are not able to unsubscribe from customer service announcements which contain important
information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards
to issues relating to their account via e-mail or phone. It is the user’s responsibility to ensure that his/her
contact information is current and correct for various purposes including notification of changes to the
Privacy Policy as set forth below.
Correction/Updating Personal Information
If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as e-mail address), or if a user no longer wishes
to use our services, we will provide a way for the user to correct, update or remove the personal data they
provided to us. Information regarding how to make such changes is available by contacting Customer
Support at customer.support@taxwise.com, or 706-290-7200.
Change of Control
In the event of a sale, merger, transfer, exchange or other disposition (whether of assets, stock or otherwise)
of all or a portion of UTS and/or its subsidiaries, users personally identifiable information may be transferred.
Users will have the opportunity to opt-out of further secondary use of information following any change of
control.
Notification of Changes
If we decide to materially change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on the TaxWise.com
Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what
circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a
manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by e-mail. Users will have
a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in
accordance with the Privacy Policy under which it was collected. UTS encourages you to periodically review
this Privacy Policy to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
Customer Responsibilities
While UTS provides significant security measures to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the user’s
information, the TaxWise customer is responsible for protecting the confidentiality of the individual EFIN and
registration code assigned to his/her office. The TaxWise customer is also responsible for protecting the
confidentiality of all tax return information originating from his/her account, and more particularly such
information that is accessed through the use of such EFIN and registration code.
