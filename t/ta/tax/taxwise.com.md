**Security**

Universal Tax Systems, Inc. takes strong precautions to protect your users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our return query form asks users to enter sensitive information such as a social security number, that information is protected with encryption software that sets the Internet standart for secure transactions -- SSL. While on a secure page the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL and TaxWise.com security measures, see our [Security Statement](https://web.archive.org/compinfo/security.asp). 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also take strong precautions to protect a user's information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who require the inforamtion to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer support representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must record the instance in our records each time your information is accessed. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. On an ongoing basis, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, in a limited access room inside a locked case. 

**Site and Service Updates**

From time to time we may send the user site and customer service announcements updates. Members are not able to un-subscirbe from customer service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone. It is the user's responsibility to ensure that his/her contact information is current and correct, including for purposes of Notification of Changes to the privacy policy as set forth below. 

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as email address), or if a user no longer wishes to use our services, we will provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can usually be done at the My Information section uxnder the user login section of the site or by contacting Customer Support by email, phone, or fax. 

**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to materially change our privacy policy, we will post a link to those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we would notify users by email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. UTS encourages you to periodically review this Privacy Statement to be informed of how we are protecting your information. 

**Customer Responsibilities**

While UTS provides significant security measures to protect the privacy and confidentialtiy of the user's information, the TaxWise customer is responsible for protecting the confidentiality of the individual EFIN and registration code assigned to his/her office. The TaxWise customer is also responsible for protecting the confidentiality of all tax return information originating from his/her account, and more particularly such information that is accessed through the use of such EFIN and registration code.
