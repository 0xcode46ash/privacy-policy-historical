You also may provide information to be published or displayed (hereinafter, “posted”) on public areas of
the Website (such as, but not limited to, the support sites and client message boards that may be accessed

contributions will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.
Children Under the Age of 13
Our Websites are not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal
information from children under 13. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any information on our
Websites or on or through any of its features/register on our Websites, make any purchases through our

Collection of Personal Information from Site Visitors
CCH SFS may collect and/or track (1) the home server domain names, email addresses, type of client
computer, and type of Web browser of visitors to our Website, (2) the e-mail addresses of visitors that
communicate with CCH SFS via e-mail, (3) information knowingly provided by the visitor in online forms,
registration forms, surveys, and contest entries (including demographic and personal profile data), and
(4) aggregate and user-specific information on which pages visitors access.
Use of Personal Information Collected
Personal data collected by CCH SFS, on our Websites, may be used by CCH SFS companies for editorial and
feedback purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, for a statistical analysis of users' behavior,
for product development, for content improvement, to inform advertisers as to how many visitors have
seen or clicked on their advertisements, or to customize the content and layout of our Websites.
Aggregate data on visitors' home servers may be used for internal purposes or provided to third parties,
such as advertisers. Individually identifying information, such as names, postal and email addresses,
phone numbers, and other personal information which visitors voluntarily provide to CCH SFS may be
added to CCH SFS databases and used for future calls and mailings regarding site updates, new products
and services, upcoming events, and status of orders placed online.
CCH sometimes collects non-identifiable information from visits to our Websites to help us provide better
customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also
measure visitor activity on CCH websites, but we do so in ways that keep the information non-identifiable.
This information is sometimes known as "clickstream data." CCH SFS or others on CCH SFS behalf may use
this data to analyze trends and statistics in order to help us provide better customer service.
Also, when we collect personal data from you in a transaction, we may extract some information about
that transaction in a non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable information such
as clickstream data. This information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand
trends and patterns. This information is not reviewed at an individual level.


In the event you desire to no longer receive communications regarding product information from CCH
SFS, you may notify CCH SFS via e-mail (marketing@cchsfs.com), by unsubscribing at
cchsfs.com/unsubscribe,or by mail at CCH SFS Marketing Dept, 225 Chastain Meadows Court NW, Suite
200, Kennesaw, GA 30144 and request removal from product information mailings by CCH SFS.
Registration
In order to access advanced support options online at our customer support site, a user must first
complete the user registration form. During this login process a user is required to give his/her User Name,
Client ID, EFIN and/or registration code. This information is used to identify the user before he/she
accesses the advanced support options. The user is required to provide this information when accessing
advanced support options so that we can provide a more personalized support experience.
Ordering
Our product order forms require you to disclose personal information. Here a user must provide contact
information (such as name and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number
and expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill the customers’ order(s). If
we experience difficulty while processing an order, the contact information is used to contact the user.
CCH SFS does not make public, sell or distribute customers’ credit card information. Our Websites use
industry-standard encryption to safeguard credit card transactions.
Cookies
Cookies can provide our users with a more personalized and convenient visit to our Web Sites. A cookie
is a small text file that is placed on a user’s hard drive by a web browser, at the request of a web page
server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs, deliver viruses to your computer, or extract personal
information from your computer. The cookies we assign to you are unique, and can only be read by our
web servers. By setting a cookie on our site, the user may not have to reenter their username multiple
times, thereby saving time while on our site. Cookies may also enable us to track and target the interests
of our users in order to enhance the experience customers have while on our sites.
CCH SFS may place Internet "cookies" on visitors' hard drives. Internet cookies may save data about
individual visitors, such as the visitor's name, password, user-name, shopping cart, screen preferences,
the pages of a site viewed by the visitor, and the advertisements viewed or clicked by the visitor. When
the visitor revisits a Website, the Website may recognize the visitor by the Internet cookie and customize
the visitor's experience accordingly. Visitors may not decline or disable Internet cookies while visiting CCH
SFS Web sites.
In the event visitors delete or disable Internet cookies, data about the individual visitor will be erased
which may result in the sites not functioning properly or when the visitor returns to our Websites (in a
new session), the Websites will not recognize the visitor.
Log Files
We use Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses to analyze trends, administer our site, track users' movement,
and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses of visitors to our public Web
Sites are not linked to personally identifiable information. CCH SFS may, in its sole discretion, record the


IP address of the computer from which an electronically filed return originated as part of our ongoing
effort to detect fraudulent information being transmitted via the Internet.
Sharing
CCH SFS may share information with its parent and/or sister companies for internal technical and
administrative purposes.
From time to time, CCH SFS may outsource the performance of certain administrative functions (e.g.,
processing credit card transactions, mailing CCH SFS marketing or account information, performing some
accounting services). In these situations the third-party service providers do not retain, share, store or use
personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
CCH SFS partners with third party companies that provide specific services such as merchant services, tech
support and bank product processing. When you sign up for services or products of a third party with
whom CCH SFS conducts business, CCH SFS will share your name or contact information to the extent
necessary for the third party to provide such products or services. These parties are not granted
permission by CCH SFS to use personally identifiable information for any purpose other than providing
these services; however, such third parties may have a different privacy policy.
Except as set forth in this privacy statement, CCH SFS does not sell, rent, share or intentionally make
publicly available any individually identifying information. CCH SFS may disclose to third parties only
information in aggregate form, that is publicly available, and/or that is knowingly and voluntarily disclosed
by visitors. If there are advertisements on CCH SFS's website, the advertiser(s) may be electronically
notified when visitors view or click on its advertisements.
Except as set forth in this privacy statement, personally identifiable information is not otherwise released
by CCH SFS to outside parties unless required by law or legal process (for example, subpoena or court
order). CCH SFS reserves the right to make exceptions to this policy in exceptional circumstances (such as
suspected illegal activity) on a case by case basis and at the sole discretion of CCH SFS. CCH SFS abides by
applicable laws and regulations governing the disclosure of information to governmental agencies.
