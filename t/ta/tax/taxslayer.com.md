As a service to our customers, we have installed links to various tax agencies/services. These include IRS.Gov, and various state agencies and organizations. The links provided are maintained by these separate entities and are not the property of, or affiliated with, Taxslayer.com. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any Web site you visit.

**Our Security Practices and Information Accuracy**

We take every step available to safeguard customer information. All forms accepting user information are processed on our secure servers. 

TaxSlayer's electronic filing process is different than most in the fact that you download our software and install it on your personal PC or you may file your return on a Web based page. Once you have completed the return on your personal PC, you are asked to transmit the return to TaxSlayer's secure website. In both the download and the web versions, the tax return file is encrypted to avoid any unwanted detection. Immediately after the files are transmitted to TaxSlayer's website, they are moved to a different location providing less likelihood of unwanted intervention. They are again moved a third time to begin processing. All acknowledgements are handled by e-mail with only general information given. Acknowledgements can also be retrieved via our website again without general information provided. (Example: IRS accepted or rejected, acceptance date, etc.) TaxSlayer will not issue a refund for returns rejected by the IRS or any state agency. Confidential information such as refund amounts, names, addresses, and account numbers are not displayed or e-mailed. 

Incomplete tax returns or returns that are not accepted by the IRS will be deleted. 

TaxSlayer.com takes industry standard measures to protect the personal information we collect. We provide high level types of security measures including, but not limited to, firewalls and protected facilities. Our Web site uses SSL encryption to transmit sensitive information (such as credit card information). We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable law and federal standards. 

We strive to keep our customer information as accurate and complete as we can. If you believe any of the information about you is not accurate, please let us know. 

**Data Retention**

We will retain your information for up to three tax years as long as your account is active, or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at [support@taxslayer.com](mailto:support@taxslayer.com.). We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. 

**Access to Personal Information:**

Personal Information is accessible online through October 20 of the year in which the return is filed. You may view, delete and/or make changes to your personal information by visiting your account online at www.taxslayer.com and selecting "Edit Account Information" [or by emailing our Customer Support at [support@taxslayer.com](mailto:support@taxslayer.com.) or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.
