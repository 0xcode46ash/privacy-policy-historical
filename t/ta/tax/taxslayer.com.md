# TaxSlayer.com - Privacy Statement

  


## YOUR PRIVACY IS A PRIORITY TO US 

At TaxSlayer.com, we are committed to safeguarding customer information. Since your privacy is a priority to us, TaxSlayer will not share nonpublic information about you with third parties outside of the TaxSlayer corporate family without your consent, except as explained in our Privacy Policy.

By participating in the council of Better Business Bureau's BBBOnLine Privacy Program we have made a commitment to meet the programs' strict requirements regarding how we treat your information and have it verified by BBBOnline.  Further information about this program is available at [ http://www.bbbonline.org](http://www.bbbonline.org/). 

**PRIVACY POLICY**

Protecting your privacy is important to TaxSlayer. We want you to understand what information we may gather and how we may share it. This Privacy Policy explains TaxSlayer's collection, use, retention and security of information about you.

**How We Collect Information**

•     **Visiting our Web Site**   
We will not collect personal information about you just because you visit this site. In order to improve the usefulness of our web site for our visitors, we automatically collect and maintain statistical information from our site's data logs that concern network traffic flow and volume. This information consists of: 

>   * The name of the domain from which the visitor accesses the Internet (e.g., "a company.com"; "a school.edu"; or "an agency.gov"); 
>   * The Internet Protocol Number; and 
>   * The date and time the IRS web site is visited. 
> 


This information does not identify individual visitors and is used to enhance and improve your experience on our site. No attempts are made to identify individual users unless illegal behavior is suspected.   


•     **Purchasing our Products**   
The purpose of this site is to market and sell our software. As a result, you may have to provide us your personal information and/or email address. We do not share or disseminate this information to other vendors or clients.  This information is kept in strictest, secure, confidence. If you choose to purchase our products online, you will be asked for personal information as well as your credit card number.  The forms requesting this information are on a secure server.  All steps are taken to safeguard your information. 

**Information Gathering**

The information we gather, in addition to your tax return, includes:  
•     **Credit Card** including:   
Cardholder's name, credit card type, credit card number, expiration date, billing address, email address.  
Credit card data is used to complete our transactions and none of this information is shared with anyone else.   
•     **Technical Assistance**   
User name, user ID, email address, operating system, connection, browser.   
•     **Tell A Friend**   
We use this information once to send a message to your friend.  We do not share any information for our "Tell A Friend" page and this information is not saved. 

**Sharing Information**

•     **Within TaxSlayer Corporate Family**   
We may share information about you and the products and services you have purchased from us, among members of the TaxSlayer Corporate family and our parent company of Rhodes Financial Services, all of whom follow our Privacy Policy. However, this information will not be provided to third parties outside or corporate family, except as noted below:   
•     **With Our Service Providers**   
In some cases, we employ service providers to provide a product you order, to fulfill a service you request, or to market one of our products or services. Examples include delivering downloadable products, offering online software applications, or sending e-mails on our behalf. While this may require us to share information, these service providers are strictly prohibited from using your information other than to act on our behalf.   
•     **For Legal Reasons**   
We may be required to provide information about you to third parties outside of the TaxSlayer corporate family without your consent as provided by law, such as, to respond to a subpoena or court order, judicial process or regulatory authorities, to protect against fraud.   
•     **In Case of Sale of Company**   
Your information may be transferred in connection with a proposed or actual sale, merger, or transfer of all or a portion of a business or operating unit. 

**Links**

As a service to our customers, we have installed links to various tax agencies/services.   These include IRS.Gov, and various state agencies and organizations. The links provided are maintained by these separate entities and are not the property of, or affiliated with, Taxslayer.com. 

**Our Former Customers**

Even if you are no longer a TaxSlayer customer, our Privacy Policy will continue to apply to you. 

**Our Security Practices and Information Accuracy**

We take every step available to safeguard customer information. All forms accepting user information are processed on our secure servers. 

TaxSlayer's electronic filing process is different than most in the fact that you download our software and install it on your personal PC or you may file your return on a Web based page. Once you have completed the return on your personal PC, you are asked to transmit the return to TaxSlayer's secure website. In both the download and the web versions, the tax return file is encrypted to avoid any unwanted detection. Immediately after the files are transmitted to TaxSlayer's website, they are moved to a different location providing less likelihood of unwanted intervention. They are again moved a third time to begin processing. All acknowledgements are handled by e-mail with only general information given. Acknowledgements can also be retrieved via our website again without general information provided. (Example: IRS accepted or rejected, acceptance date, etc.) Confidential information such as refund amounts, names, addresses, and account numbers are not displayed or e-mailed. 

Incomplete tax returns or returns that are not accepted by the IRS will be deleted. 

We strive to keep our customer information as accurate and complete as we can. If you believe any of the information about you is not accurate, please let us know. 

**Access to Personal Information:**

Personal Information is accessible online through Oct. 15th 2008. Any return e-filed through TaxSlayer.com will be available only in PDF format (fees may apply). 

**Other Information**

The Privacy Policy applies to products and services of TaxSlayer.com, online. Please note that the BBOnLine Privacy Seal only covers information collected through our TaxSlayer website.  It does not cover personal information gathered through the TaxSlayer download software.  We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy, and any of the policies described above, at any time. Any changes to our policy will be immediately posted and made available to consumers at our website and these changes will not take effect for 15 days after their initial posting.  We will also email users with this information.  The examples contained within this Privacy Policy are illustrations; they are not intended to be exclusive. 

**Approved and Effective 1/1/2000**
