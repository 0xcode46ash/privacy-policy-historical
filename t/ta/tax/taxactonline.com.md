## Communications and Opt-Out Options

We may periodically send you communications about new products, services, or upcoming events. You may choose to be removed from our email mailing list by following the instructions in those emails or by contacting TaxAct using one of the methods listed at the top of this page (email, phone, or mail) to request that you be removed from our marketing list. Note, however, that even if you opt out of receiving marketing communications, we will still contact you for non-marketing purposes (such as account information, legal notices, account security, bug alerts, and/or changes that may impact your ability to use TaxAct products and services).

Upon request (see "For Further Information" section), TaxAct will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. You can access, correct or deactivate your account information by visiting www.taxact.com and selecting "My Account" in top right-hand corner of the home page or by contacting us at the email address provided above. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. If you e-file your tax return, you will not be able to update your tax return information once your tax return has been filed, unless the IRS rejects the return. You may check if your return has been accepted or rejected by selecting [Check e-file status](https://web.archive.org/ef/efile-center).

If you deactivate your account, you will no longer be able to access any of the information associated with that account including information you provided through associated applications, such as Donation Assistant, or other Services. If you choose to deactivate your account, we retain your account information in our archives even though it is no longer accessible online. We retain all e-filed returns and related information as necessary to comply with our legal and contractual obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

After the tax return extension filing deadline, all TaxAct tax returns are archived. We provide the ability for you to access your archived return in certain circumstances.

We work to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access, alteration and destruction by using industry standard safeguards, procedures, and practices. These safeguards include physical, logical and technical protections for physical security; information security; and additional measures to restrict access to data we hold in physical and electronic forms. For example, we restrict access to personal information to those on a need to know basis and we encrypt credit card information when it's transmitted to us. Your access to the Services is password-protected with complex password requirements, security questions, and authentication by email or mobile phone. You should use a unique password and should not share your password with anyone.
