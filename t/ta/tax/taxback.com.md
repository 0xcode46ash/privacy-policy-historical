If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.

**Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies**  
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer hard drive. Cookies help analyse web traffic and allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.   
Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.   
We use cookies on this site. We link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.

Some of our business partners or third parties use cookies or other tracking technologies on our site. Data is only collected in the aggregate. We have no access to or control over these cookies.

**Links to Other Sites**  
If you click on a link to a third party site, you will leave our site and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personally identifiable information by such third parties, and such sites are not governed by this privacy policy. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any other service provider from whom you request services.

**Security**  
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as social security number) on our forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).  
We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure and we follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.  
If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us as described below.

**Additional Policy Information**  
Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. We also have testimonials on our sites, for which if a user posted personal information with this, we have received permission.

We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices.
