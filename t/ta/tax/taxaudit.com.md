The Internet is an amazing tool. It has the ability to provide a significant amount of information with a few simple mouse clicks. With these abilities, numerous individuals and companies have developed methods to capture and retain information regarding their website visitors. In many cases, the website visitor is not even aware that this information is being captured. It is important to TaxResources to help our members retain their privacy when they take advantage of all the Internet has to offer.

To protect your privacy, TaxResources, Inc. follows five principles in accordance with worldwide practices for member privacy and data protection.

**PRINCIPLE 1 – NOTICE OF INTENT**  
When we need information that personally identifies you (Personal Information) or allows us to contact you, we will ask you for it. Generally this information is requested when you are placing an order for either a new or renewal membership, requesting tax advice, downloading free software, requesting information on free products or merchandise, accessing our limited-access members-only site, or purchasing any other product or service from us. We use your Personal Information for five primary purposes:

  * To make the site easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once.
  * To help you quickly find services or information on the TaxResources websites.
  * To help us create content more relevant to you.
  * To gather the information required to provide the requested services.
  * To alert you to additional products and services, renewal information, special offers, updated information and other new services available from TaxResources.

****

**PRINCIPLE 2 – CONSENT TO USE**  
If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still use the non-member portions of the TaxResources websites. But you will not be able to access areas that require registration. You will be able to provide this same information via telephone, fax, or mail if you prefer.

If you decide to register, you will be able to select which services you wish to receive from TaxResources. We request information from the user on our order forms. The user must provide contact information (name, spouse information, mailing address, telephone numbers) and financial information (credit card number, expiration date, billing address). This information is used for billing and membership registration purposes. If we have trouble processing your order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.

TaxResources has a policy of not soliciting their membership with the exception of renewal mailings or other offerings that may accompany the quarterly TaxBulletin. When a renewal is due, we may contact the member via telephone, email, and postal mail in order to verify the member’s intent regarding the renewal billing. We also periodically ask members to verify their satisfaction with the services provided particularly after the conclusion of an audit.

TaxResources, Inc. has a long-standing policy of not providing personal information to any third parties. It is not necessary to request that TaxResources, Inc. not allow access by third parties to your personal information.

**PRINCIPLE 3 – ACCESS TO YOUR INFORMATION**  
We will provide you with the means to ensure your personal information is correct and current. You may review and update this information at any time at the Member Center. The Member Center provides access to various types of information and in addition provides you the ability to:

  * View and edit personal information you have already given us.
  * Renew your membership.
  * Report the receipt of an audit notice.
  * Request responses to tax questions that you may have.

****

**PRINCIPLE 4 – SECURITY POLICY**  
TaxResources, Inc. strictly protects the security of your personal information and honors your choices for its intended use. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.  
**  
** This website takes every precaution to protect our members’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect member information off-line. All of our members’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected workstations to gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Our employees are notified and/or reminded routinely about the importance we place on privacy, and what they need to do to ensure our members’ information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment behind industry standard firewalls.

Because of the nature of the services we offer, we often receive confidential tax information relating to our members. We restrict the access to that information to individuals that are licensed to practice before the Internal Revenue Service and are covered under Treasury Department Circular 230 and the various laws and regulations regarding attorney-client privilege and the protection of confidential tax information. Email and other correspondence directed to the Audit and Technical Division (such as tax advice questions and tax returns) are only accessed by such individuals and are not disseminated to nonqualified individuals.

It is important for our members to remember that in order to keep your privilege regarding this information, you can only talk to individuals that qualify for this privilege. Do not discuss these issues with any customer service or sales personnel of this or any other company. Do not discuss these issues with friends or relatives other than your spouse (in most states). Note: Information you discuss with anyone that is directly or indirectly related to the preparation of your tax return is specifically not covered by the attorney-client privilege.

 _We will never release any information that is covered under attorney-client privilege_. However, if TaxResources, Inc. should be presented with a subpoena or other government order, we will cooperate and provide only the relevant information that is not covered under the attorney-client privilege.

If you have any questions about the security at our website or within our company, you can send an email to 

[security@taxaudit.com](mailto:security@taxaudit.com) .

**PRINCIPLE 5 – ENFORCEMENT OF PRIVACY POLICIES**  
If for some reason you believe TaxResources, Inc. has not adhered to these principles, please notify us by e-mail at 

[homepage@taxaudit.com](mailto:homepage@taxaudit.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy), and we will do our best to investigate and correct the problem promptly. Be certain the words Privacy Policy are in the Subject line.

**PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
Every member has a unique member record. Each record is assigned a unique Membership Identification Number, which helps us ensure that only you and authorized TaxResources personnel can access your personal information. In addition to traditional methods of contact, this information can be accessed in the Member Center of our website.

In order to access the Member Center, you will need to have your Membership ID Number and the password assigned by TaxResources, Inc. This information will be provided to you when you initially become a member, when you receive a renewal notice, and when your membership renewal has been processed. If you lose your password or your password has become compromised, you will need to contact TaxResources and a new password will be issued to you. Because of security issues, the password can only be sent to either the last known address or the last known email address, without a written request.

**COOKIES  
**A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. This site does not use cookies whatsoever.

**LOG FILES**  
We use IP (Internet Protocol) addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. **  
**  
**REFER A FRIEND**  
If a member elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask the member for the friend’s name and email address and the member’s name. TaxResources, Inc. will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. TaxResources stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact TaxResources to request the removal of this information from our database.

**SHARING OF INFORMATION  
**We periodically use an outside shipping company to mail newsletters and other items. These companies do not have access to any financial information and are not allowed to retain, store, or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

We partner with other parties to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.

These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

**LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES  
**This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we [TaxResources, Inc.] are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our website, to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by TaxResources websites.

**NOTIFICATION OF PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES**  
In the unlikely event that we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify members by way of an email. 

_Members will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner_. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

**ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS  
**If you have any additional questions about this privacy statement, you can send an email to 

[privacy@taxaudit.com](mailto:privacy@taxaudit.com).
