**Your Information:**

From time to time, you may be asked to submit information in order for us to better serve you. How we handle such information depends upon the nature of such information. Our policy with respect to different types of information is set forth below.

Your IP address:

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information.

Financial Information: All financial information collected on our site will remain absolutely confidential and will never be disclosed to any non-affiliated companies except as required by law.

Financial information includes information such as credit card numbers and bank account information. We may store such information on our secure servers to expedite processing of certain services and products we provide to you.

Identifying and Contact Information:

From time to time, you may be asked to provide certain Identifying and Contact Information, such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number, user name, and demographic information. This information is used to verify your identity, determine your eligibility for special programs or services we may offer and complete transactions. At times it will be necessary to use your Contact Information to communicate with you concerning administrative matters, responding to your requests and notifying you of the status of your transactions, even though you have requested to not receive information from us in our Opt-In/ Out section. However, we will never disclose Identifying and Contact Information to third parties without your consent except as required by law.

Order and Payment Information.

We gather contact and payment information from you to process your order. This information may include name, address, phone and e-mail address and as payment is required, credit card information. We may use your contact information to notify you of important product updates, significant tax law changes or promotional opportunities.

Mandatory and Optional Information.

We identify the information that is necessary to fulfill your request. Whenever we ask for additional or optional information, we identify those fields appropriately so that you know what is required to provide the requested service. A decision to provide incomplete information in the preparation of a tax return, for example, will preclude the full and proper use of the TaxBrain Web products. You cannot complete and file a tax return using the TaxBrain online tax product if you do not identify yourself, although you do not have to identify yourself to just try out the product.

Personally Identifiable Information:

We provide you the opportunity to update or correct the contact and tax return information that you have provided to us. The tax return information and personally identifiable information collected through this site is contained in tax returns and in product registration information. Once you have completed a tax return using the TaxBrain Web product and directed that it be electronically filed, you cannot change the information in it because the tax return has become a legal record of your tax filing.

**Tax Related Information:**  

When you prepare or file a tax return with us, the information contained in your tax return will be treated with extreme care and confidence. From time to time, we may ask your permission to share certain information contained in your tax return, such as home ownership queries, with our affiliates and business partners in order to better serve you. However, we will never disclose any tax return information without your consent except as required by law.

As a method for detecting fraud in tax information transmitted via the Internet, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires Petz Enterprises to provide to the IRS, in connection with the electronic filing of tax returns, the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer from which the return originated. We are also required to notify the IRS whether the e-mail address of the person electronically filing the return has been collected.

Tax Estimator: Information entered into the Tax Estimator is used solely to provide you with tax estimates. It does not collect personally identifiable information, and the information that you provide is neither saved nor transferred to any other party.

Contest/Promotions and Surveys:

We may elect to administer contests and online surveys where we will ask you for contact information, such as your e-mail address and demographic information, such as your zip code, age or income level. We may use contact information to send you information about our company. You will be given the choice to opt-in to receive offers at the time the information is requested. If, at any time, you elect to discontinue receiving information from us, please see the opt-in/out section below.

Public Forums:

This site may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available. Please remember that any information disclosed in these areas becomes public information, and you should exercise caution when disclosing personal information in these applications.

Choice/Opt-In/Out:

Petz Enterprises provides you with the opportunity to opt-in when receiving communications from us and/or our partners at the point where we request information about you. Once you choose to opt-in, if at any time, you elect to discontinue receiving information from us or to end service, simply visit Submit a Question and you will be promptly removed from the mailing list.
