We respect the privacy of users who visit our website:

  * We do not attempt to identify individuals visiting our website without their knowledge.
  * We log requests and IP addresses in order to aggregate information on how much traffic we have, which pages users access, and whether there are any technical issues present. This information is collected solely for internal website management purposes and is never used in an attempt to identify individuals.
  * The Tax Foundation website is served over a secure, encrypted connection. Any information provided by visitors through the Tax Foundation website is likewise encrypted and access to that information is limited among the staff.
  * The Tax Foundation allows users who wish to receive email updates from us to submit their email and mailing addresses at [taxfoundation.org/subscribe/](https://taxfoundation.org/subscribe/). This information is then used to communicate only with individuals who have requested that we do so. We do not sell, rent or otherwise share this personal information with any third parties, for any reason whatsoever. Registered subscribers can change the email messages that they receive, or stop receiving them altogether, at any time by clicking the link reading “update subscription preferences” at the bottom of Tax Foundation emails.

We do not sell or rent this information, we do not provide information to commercial entities, nor do we ever provide phone numbers or e-mail addresses to anyone. **Donors  may opt out of such mailings by sending an e-mail message to ****[ajm@taxfoundation.org](mailto:ajm@taxfoundation.org)** **with their opt-out request**.
  * To the extent any donations are processed through a third-party service provider, our donors’ information will only be used for purposes necessary to process the donation.
