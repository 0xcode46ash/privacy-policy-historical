Tattersall's is committed to the protection of the personal information of individuals. Our privacy policy sets out the principles we will adopt in the management of personal information. This policy is subject to the specific terms and conditions of any Tattersall's products.

**1\. Compliance With Privacy Legislation**

Tattersall's is bound by, and will comply with, the National Privacy Principles (NPPs) set out in the Privacy Act 1988 ("Act").

**2\. Collection of Personal Information**

Personal information is generally defined as information or an opinion that can identify a person. The type of personal information that Tattersall's may collect about you will depend upon the nature of your relationship with Tattersall's. For example, we may need more information about you to become a Tatts Card member than we would if you wished to enter a competition. We collect information from you directly and also from your use of our products and services.

**3\. Use and Disclosure of Personal Information**

In general, Tattersall's policy is that we will use or disclose personal information for the purpose which was either specified or reasonably apparent at the time of collection. We may also use or disclose it for any other related purpose for which you would reasonably expect it to be used. Tattersall's may also use your personal information to send marketing or promotional material to you, unless you indicate that you do not wish to receive it.

Tattersall's does not generally disclose personal information to third parties except:

  * where third party contractors appointed by Tattersall's require access to personal information held by us to perform services for us or on our behalf; or
  * where Tattersall's reasonably believes it is necessary to protect any person and/or Tattersall's rights or property; or
  * where Tattersall's is required or authorised by law to do so; or
  * with your consent.



**4\. Web Site**

Tattersall's may collect "clickstream" information (such as areas of our website you have accessed and the time and date of access) from an individual's use of our websites. Tattersall's may also collect Doubleclick Adserving information (such as whether a marketing campaign has been effective) from an individual's use of our websites.

We may also store "cookie" information, such as user preferences relating to the use of our websites. A cookie is a small data file that may be placed on the computer of a web user (usually in the browser software folder). The information collected is used to customise and improve our websites.
