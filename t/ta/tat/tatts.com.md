# Tatts Group Limited - Privacy Statement

**1\. Compliance With Privacy Legislation**

Tatts Group is bound by, and will comply with, the National Privacy Principles (NPPs) set out in the Privacy Act 1988 ("Act").

**2\. Collection of Personal Information**

Personal information is generally defined as information or an opinion that can identify a person. The type of personal information that Tatts Group may collect about you will depend upon the nature of your relationship with Tatts Group and each specific Tatts Group company. For example, we may need more information about you to become a Tatts Card, Winners Circle, Telebet or Netbet member than we would if you wished to enter a competition. We collect information from you directly and also from your use of our products and services.

**3\. Use and Disclosure of Personal Information**

In general, Tatts Group policy is that we will use or disclose personal information for the purpose which was either specified or reasonably apparent at the time of collection. We may also use or disclose it for any other related purpose for which you would reasonably expect it to be used. Tatts Group companies may also use your personal information to send marketing or promotional material to you, unless you indicate that you do not wish to receive it.

Tatts Group does not generally disclose personal information to third parties except:

  * where third party contractors appointed by Tatts Group require access to personal information held by us to perform services for us or on our behalf; or
  * where Tatts Group reasonably believes it is necessary to protect any person and/or Tatts Group rights or property; or
  * where Tatts Group is required or authorised by law to do so; or 
  * with your consent.



**4\. Tatts Group Web Sites**

Specific Tatts Group websites may collect "clickstream" information (such as areas of our website you have accessed and the time and date of access) from an individual's use of our websites. Tatts Group may also collect Doubleclick Adserving information (such as whether a marketing campaign has been effective) from an individual's use of our websites.

We may also store "cookie" information, such as user preferences relating to the use of our websites. A cookie is a small data file that may be placed on the computer of a web user (usually in the browser software folder). The information collected is used to customise and improve our websites. If you do not want us to store cookie information on your computer, you can set your browser to disable this feature. This may mean you will not be able to take full advantage of Tatts Group services offered on our websites.

**5\. Security of Personal Information**

Tatts Group will take reasonable steps to protect the personal information it holds and to ensure it is accurate and up-to-date.

**6\. Seeking Access to Personal Information**

Individuals are welcome to request access to personal information Tatts Group holds about them. There are certain situations where Tatts Group may decline to give you access to your personal information, and these are set out in the Act.

In specific cases, please write directly to the Tatts Group company concerned and include your full name, address, date of birth and signature. We will send you the appropriate access form. In all cases we will inform you if a cost applies to finding and supplying the information before we perform this task.

**7\. Changing Information**

If you have reason to believe personal information which we hold about you is inaccurate or out-of-date, please write to the relevant Tatts Group company and include your full name, address, date of birth, membership number, signature and specify the information you wish to change.

**8\. Anonymous Transactions**

Where it is lawful and practicable to do so, customers may transact business with Tatts Group without providing personal information.

**9\. Sending Information Overseas**

Tatts Group will only transfer personal data overseas in circumstances where it is permitted by the Act.

**10\. Changes in the Future**

Tatts Group reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time and to notify its customers by posting an updated version of the policy on our website, www.tattsgroup.com.
