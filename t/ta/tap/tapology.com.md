# Tapology.com Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours may be collected by Tapology.com, how the information may be used, and how you can control the collection, correction and removal of information.  We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.  By using our site, you consent to our Privacy Policy.

**Information We Collect**

User-Provided Information: You provide us information about yourself, such as your name and e-mail address, when you register with us.  If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses.

Cookies Information: When you visit our site, we may send one or more cookies – a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets us log you in faster and enhance your site navigation.  A cookie does not collect personal information about you.  Among these cookies may be the [DoubleClick DART cookie](http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx) which is used by Google as a third party vendor in the ads served on the websites of its partners. Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to users based on visits to our sites and/or other sites on the internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

Log File Information: Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page.  When you register with or view our site, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.

**How We Use Your Information**

Any personal information or content that you post on Tapology.com becomes available to the public.  If you remove such content, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your personal information.

By providing us with your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you site-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features of the site, or special offers.  If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out by sending an email message to us with the word “No email” in the subject field and we will remove your email address from our distribution list as quickly as possible.

Tapology.com may use certain information about you and your content without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as analyzing how our site is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing advertisements and promotions.

We reserve the right to monitor the content you post on the site. We have the right to remove any such information or material for any reason or no reason.

**How We Share Your Information**

Personally Identifiable Information: Tapology.com does not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to others.  We may share your personally identifiable information with third parties solely for the purpose of providing services to you.  If we do this, such use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy.  We may store personal information in locations outside our direct control (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).

As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions.

Except as otherwise described herein, Tapology.com will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our terms of use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of our company, our users or others.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain site activities.

Tapology.com may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements on our site. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.

We do not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.  You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. We cannot control the activities of these advertisers.

**How We Protect Your Information**

We use commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.  To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications with us, at all times.

**Compromise of Personal Information**

In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.

**Your Choices About Your Information**

You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information to us, in which case we may not be able to provide certain services to you.

**Children’s Privacy**

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.  For that reason, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to us. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us.

**Links to Other Web Sites**

We are not responsible for the practices, information or content of sites linked to or from our site.  Your browsing and interaction on any other web site, including those that have a link on our web site, is subject to that site’s own rules and policies.

**Changes to Our Privacy Policy**

If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on our website to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it.  Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
