# TapResearch Privacy Policy

#### TapResearch Privacy Policy

Last updated: March 18, 2015

This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes the information collected by TapResearch, Inc. (“we,” “us,” or “our”), how we collect that information, how that information may be used, and with whom it may be shared. By accessing or using our website, currently located at http://www.tapresearch.com (including any subpages, directories, or mobile versions of the website) (collectively the “Website”), participating in our surveys, and/or using other products or services we may provide (each a “Service,” and collectively, “Services”), you are accepting the practices set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, then you must not access or use the Services. 

#### Information Collected and Method of Collection

Information collected is relevant for the purpose for which it is to be used and, to the extent necessary; TapResearch takes reasonable steps to ensure that data is reliable for intended use, accurate, complete, and current. 

**(a) Information collected automatically:** When you use the Services, we automatically collect and store information about your computer or mobile device and your online activities (“Response Metadata”), which you grant us the permission to transfer and store in accordance with the provisions contained in this Privacy Policy. Response Metadata may include: 

  * _Device Information/Specifications._ Technical information about your computer or device (e.g., type of device, web browser or operating system, IP address, mobile device ID, etc.). 
  * _Geographic Location._ Your computer or device's geographic location and the applicable time zone. 
  * _Device Information/Specifications._ Technical information about your computer or device (e.g., type of device, web browser or operating system, IP address). 
  * _Time, Length and Extent of Usage._ When you use the Services, how long you use a Service for (e.g., how long it takes you to answer a survey question) and which Services feature(s) and/or function(s) you use. 
  * _Cookies:_ We may use “cookies” to keep track of some types of information while you are using the Services. “Cookies” are very small files placed on your computer, which allow us to count the number of users of the Services and distinguish repeat users from new or unique users. Cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze usage of the Services more accurately, such as user preferences or trends (e.g., the Services may set a cookie on your browser allowing you to bypass engagement with a survey due to your previous completion of a survey). We rely on cookies for the proper operation of the Services; therefore if your browser is set to reject cookies, the Services may not function properly. If you refuse cookies from the Services, you assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality or benefits with respect to the Services. 
  * _Web Beacons:_ We may use web beacons in email communications in order to understand the behavior of our users. “Web beacons” (also known as “clear gifs” and “pixel tags”) are small transparent graphic images that are often used in conjunction with cookies in order to further personalize the Services for our users and to collect a limited set of information about our users. 



**(b) Information you provide to us:** We collect any information that you submit to us voluntarily through the Services or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide such information to us by refraining from using the Services, or refraining from directly submitting such information to us. However, if you do not provide the applicable information when requested, you may not be able to benefit from the full range of Services, and we may not be able to provide you with information about our products, services, surveys, and promotions. If you provide us with comments, suggestions, recommendations or other feedback pertaining to our Services (collectively “Feedback’), you understand that we may (although we have no obligation to do so) retain, disclose, use, or otherwise commercially exploit that Feedback in connection with any or all of our Services without any compensation or consideration to you. You may also withdraw any consent you previously provided to us, or object at any time on legitimate grounds to the processing of your personal information by contacting us at support@tapresearch.com. We will apply your preferences going forward. In some circumstances, withdrawing your consent to our use or disclosure of your personal information will mean that you cannot take advantage of certain products, services, surveys or promotions we may offer. Where required by law, we obtain your prior opt-in consent at the time of collection for the processing of (i) personal information for marketing purposes and (ii) personal information deemed sensitive pursuant to applicable law. An example of the information you voluntarily submit is the information you choose to provide within any survey offered through the Services; such information includes but is not limited to demographics information such as household income, age, etc. (each a "Survey Response"). You grant us permission to transfer and store your Survey Responses, which may be shared with and/or sold to third parties (e.g., our customers) in accordance with the section entitled “Sharing Your Information” below. 

**(c) Developers:** For our developer partners, we may collect certain information from you at the time of registration and in connection with your use of the Services, including your name, email address, company name, app title(s), as well as financial information such as Tax ID, VAT or sales tax registration number or any other relevant tax number and payment information (e.g., bank account and routing number for ACH purposes). 

#### How We Use Your Information

Pursuant to the terms of this Privacy Policy, we may use the information we collect from you for the following purposes:

  * To process, analyze, and develop survey data for use with the Services and our third party customers;
  * To improve upon the surveys and delivery of our surveys through the Services;
  * To prevent fraud and other illegal activities;
  * To monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities;
  * To communicate with you about the Services; and
  * To provide, maintain, and improve the Services and our overall business.



You can opt-out and instruct us not to send you marketing communications by e-mail by clicking on the unsubscribe link within the marketing emails you receive from us or by contacting us at support@tapresearch.com. 

#### Sharing Your Information

The information we collect is used to improve the content and the quality of our Services, and without your consent we will not otherwise sell, license or share your personal information to/with any other party(s) for commercial purposes, except: (a) to provide the Services, or (b) or under the following instances: 

_Survey Response Data._ We may sell, license, or share the Survey Responses and Response Metadata (collectively, the “Response Data”) and related information with survey creators and researchers (i.e., our customers). We may aggregate your Response Data with Response Data collected from other users through the Services and share such aggregated data with third parties, including our advisors, investors, and/or customers; however, in no way shall any such aggregated Response Data be shared in such a manner as to allow an individual to be personally identified. Additionally, we may share Response Data we collect with third parties in connection with the use and operation of the Services and other aspects of our business (e.g., with our customers, agents, advisors, consultants, advertisers, business partners, investors and/or vendors). 

_Legal Disclosures and Business Transfers._ We may disclose any information we collect without notice or consent from you: (a) in response to a legal request, such as a subpoena, court order, or government demand; (b) to investigate or report suspected or actual fraud or other illegal activity; (c) in order to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the general public; or (d) to enforce our rights or defend claims. We also reserve the right to disclose or transfer the information we collect to another company in connection with a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event (a “Corporate Transaction”). We will endeavor to provide you with notice (via a posting to our website or such other method that we deem appropriate) of any such Corporate Transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity. 

_Service Providers._ We may use service providers to help us provide you with the Services. Examples of service providers include payment processors, hosting or cloud service providers, and web traffic analytics tools. We may give relevant persons working for some of these providers access to your information, but only to the extent necessary for them to perform their services for us. 

#### Children and Minors

The Services are not intended for children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect or solicit Response Data or personal information from persons under the age of 13. If you are a parent or legal guardian who discovers that your child has provided us with any of the foregoing, you may contact us at support@tapresearch.com, and we will endeavor to promptly delete such information from our files. 

#### Information Security

We attempt to safeguard and protect your personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, through maintenance and use of reasonable security measures such as SSL and Https encryption, as well as using reputable service providers, such as Amazon EC2 with respect to data storage. However, please bear in mind and be aware that unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and the inherent insecure nature of the Internet, among other factors, may potentially compromise the security of your information at any given time. As such, we cannot make any guarantees as to the security of your information. 

#### Location of Data

We may transfer the information we collect about you to countries other than the country in which the information was originally collected. Please be advised, however, that such countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. We will protect your information as described in this Privacy Policy when we transfer such information to other countries. By using the Services, you consent to the collection, transfer, use, storage and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy, including to the export of your information outside of your country of residence. If you are accessing or using the Services from outside the United States, please be aware that your information, including any Response Data may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States. As a result, United States Federal and state governments, courts, or law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information, including Response Data, through applicable United States laws and regulations. 

#### US-EU Safe Harbor

TapResearch complies with the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework established by the US Department of Commerce, which relates to the collection, use, and retention of personal information from EU member countries and Switzerland. TapResearch has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/. 

#### Third Party Links, Websites, and Services

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage, nor does it apply to your relationship with the third party web sites, applications, services, and surveys that may be linked to, facilitated through or provided via our Services. If you use a third party website, application or service or participate in a third party survey, then such third party's privacy policy will govern the use, storage and disclosure of your information in connection with such site, application, service, or survey. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third party sites, applications, services, and surveys nor any data or information you may share with such third parties. We encourage you to read the privacy policies applicable to each and every third party site, application, service, and survey prior to your access, use, or participation. 

#### Changes and Updates

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, at our sole discretion. We will notify you of such changes by posting the updated Privacy Policy on our Website. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "last updated" date found at the top of this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you check this Privacy Policy periodically, to inform yourself of any changes to it. Your continued use of the Services after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy become effective will indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy.
