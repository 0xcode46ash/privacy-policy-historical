# Privacy Policy | Tapastic

As you use our services, we want you to be clear how weâ€™re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.

We have tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you are not familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and browsers, then read about these [key terms](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/key-terms/) (as defined by Google) first. Your privacy matters to us so whether you are new to Tapastic ("Tapas") or a long-time user, please take the time to get to know our practices - and if you have any questions contact us.

  * Information we collect 

Similar to many other websites, we collect basic information to provide better services to all of our users.

We collect information in two ways:

    * _Information you give us._

For example, our service requires you to sign up for a Tapastic user account for additional features. When you do, we ask for [personal information](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-personal-info) \- like your name, location, and email address. When including your display name, photo, location and bio, be aware that such information are a part of your public profile and are visible to anyone who visits your profile page.

    * _Information we get from your use of our services._

We may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them. This information includes:

      * Device information. We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, [unique device identifiers](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-unique-device-id), and mobile network information including phone number). Tapastic may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Tapastic user account.
      * Log information. When you use our services or view content provided on the service, we may automatically collect and store certain information in [server logs](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-server-logs). 

This may include:

        * details of how you used our service, such as your search queries.
        * [Internet protocol address](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-ip).
        * device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.
        * cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your Tapastic user account.
      * Location information. When you use a location-enabled service, we may collect and process information about your actual location, like GPS signals sent by a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.
      * Unique application numbers. Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Tapastic when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.
      * Local storage. We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.
      * Cookies and anonymous identifiers. We use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit our services, and this may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device. We also use [cookies](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-cookie) and [anonymous identifiers](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-identifier) when you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as advertising services or Tapastic features that may appear on other sites.
  * Transparency and choice 
    * People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. You can edit your profile information by clicking on your profile icon and then the "Edit Profile" button.
    * You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set by us. However, it is important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.
  * Information you share 

Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines such as Google or Bing. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and removing your content.

  * Accessing and updating your personal information 
    * With your consent. We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Tapas when we have your consent to do so. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any [sensitive personal information](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-sensitive-info).
    * With domain administrators. For external processing (like accounting for Primetime Publishers)
    * We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
    * For legal reasons. We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Tapas if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to: 
      * meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
      * enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
      * detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
      * protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Tapas, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.
    * We may share aggregated, [non-personally identifiable information](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-info) publicly and with our partners - like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.
    * If Tapas is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
  * Information security 

We work hard to protect Tapas and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold. In particular:

    * We encrypt many of our services [using SSL](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/173733?=).
    * We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.
    * We restrict access to personal information to Tapas employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
  * Application 
    * Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Tapas and its affiliates, including services (such as our advertising services), but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.
    * Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you in advertisements, sites that may include Tapas services, or other sites linked from our services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other companies and organizations who advertise our services, and who may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads.
  * Enforcement 

We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.

  * Changes 

Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes).
