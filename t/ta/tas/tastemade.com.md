# Privacy | Tastemade

_Effective May 25, 2018_

**Introduction**

Protecting your privacy is really important to us.  This Privacy Policy covers all of the services of Tastemade, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “ ** _Tastemade_** ”, “ ** _we_** ”, “ ** _us_** ”, or “ ** _our_** ”), and our mobile applications, desktop application services, software and other materials and services made available on, from or through the foregoing (collectively, the “ ** _Services_** ”). For the purposes of European Economic Area data protection law, (the " ** _Data Protection Law_** "), we are the data controller.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We appreciate that you do not want your personal information distributed indiscriminately and we provide this Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive when you use our Services. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through your use of the Services. This Privacy Policy doesn’t apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, such as applications and websites using Facebook and other social media sites, even if they are accessible through our Services. 

Please read this Privacy Policy, and if you have any questions or suggestions, please contact us at [info@tastemade.com](mailto:info@tastemade.com).  Also, please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized words used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Use found at https://www.tastemade.com/terms. 

Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. 

By using our Services, you acknowledge you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.

**How do we collect your information?**

You are under no obligation to provide any such information. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services.

**Cookies and other technologies**

Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we call this information “ ** _Log Data_** ”), including both account holders and non-account holders (either, a “ ** _User_** ”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links or buttons on our Services that a User clicked on (including advertisements clicked on) and other statistics. 

Our Services use cookies, pixels and similar technologies to distinguish you from other users of our Services. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our site, use our App, or otherwise engage with our Services and also allows us to improve our Services. 

When you use the Services, a web server sends a cookie or other similar technology such as device IDs or pixel tags to your computer or mobile device (as the case may be). These typically involves small pieces of information or code which are issued to or accessed from your computer or mobile device (as the case may be) when you visit a website or app and which store and sometimes track information about you. Cookies and similar technologies enable you to be remembered when using that computer or device to interact with websites, apps and online services and can be used to manage a range of features and content as well as storing searches and presenting personalized content.

We use these cookies and other technologies on the basis that they are necessary for the performance of a contract with you (i.e. the provision of Services), or because using them is in our legitimate interests (where we have considered that these are not overridden by your rights), and, in some cases, where required by law, where you have consented to their use.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies and similar technologies, but if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that and your help screen or manual will tell you how to do this.  We also give you information about how to disable cookies here.  However, you may not be able to take full advantage of our Services if you do so.  A number of cookies and similar technologies we use last only for the duration of your use of our Services and expire when you close your browser. Other cookies and similar technologies are used to remember you when you return to use the Services and will last for longer.

**Disabling cookies**

Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. You can also learn more about cookies by visiting [www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.tastemade.co.uk/www.allaboutcookies.org) which includes additional useful information on cookies and how to block cookies using different types of browser or mobile device. 

If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services.

Tastemade will only process personal data in ways that are compatible with the purpose that Tastemade collected it for, or for purposes you later authorize. Before we use your personal data for a purpose that is materially different than the purpose we collected it for or that you later authorize, we will provide you with the opportunity to opt out. Tastemade maintains reasonable procedures to help ensure that personal data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete and current. 

What information do we share with third parties?

We may disclose your personal information to: 

  * Any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, who support our processing of personal data under this policy (if any of these parties are using your information for direct marketing purposes, we will only transfer the information to them for that purpose with your prior consent); and

**Security of your information**

We place great importance on the security of all personal information associated with our users. We have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information under our control. For example, when you enter sensitive and/or personal information on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Where you have chosen (or we have given you) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

However, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure and any such submission is at your own risk. Whilst we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access. 

It is advisable to close your browser when you have finished your user session to help ensure others do not access your personal information if you use a shared computer or a computer in a public place.

**Payment processing**

If you subscribe to a paid Service, we use Stripe to process and accept payments, or if you subscribe to a paid Service via Apple iTunes or Google Play.  If you purchase products from our Service (e.g. via an online Tastemade shop) we use Shopify to process and accept payments. In each of these cases, your payment will be processed via those respective services who operate a secure server to process payment details, encrypt your credit/debit card information and authorize payment. We do not store any credit card information, but Stripe, Apple, Google or Shopify, as applicable) will collect credit card information and any other payment-related information. Each such third-party service uses the payment-related information that it receives as necessary and appropriate to fulfil requests to process payment transactions, to facilitate billing and to otherwise deliver payment services. Personal information about our users is used by each such service to process payment transactions and for no other purpose, and this information is subject to
