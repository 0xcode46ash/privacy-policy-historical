# Privacy Policy | TascaParts.com

### Shop with Confidence at TascaParts.com

Tasca Parts Center understands that our customers are concerned about their online privacy and the security/protection of personal information. 

We are committed to maintaining rigorous standards designed to preserve your confidentiality and protect your personal information and your rights as a consumer.

### Your Information is Secure

Tasca Automotive Group promises never to sell, share or rent your name, email, or other personal information to any other company. 

### Information Collection and Use

We collect aggregate, non- identifiable information on visits made to our website in order to improve the content of our site and user experience. 

We also collect, when you place an order, your name, address, email, and other information necessary to process your order and contact you.  

Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) are used only to obtain the correct parts for a particular vehicle through our Electronic Parts Catalog system (EPC). No personal information is extracted using an EPC.

The information collected is stored in a secure database and is used strictly by Tasca Automotive Group to provide service and never for any other purpose.

### Secure Shopping

SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption is used to encode and protect sensitive information such as telephone and credit card numbers. 

With SSL encryption, credit card information is neither stored nor exposed, but is transmitted via a secure “token” process.  While you are on any of these secure pages, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of your web browser will show as “locked” – indicating a safe connection that allows for worry-free  transmission of your personal information.

### Notification of Changes

Changes to our website privacy policy will be posted on our web site. If our policy regarding our use of email address changes, visitors will be notified before the policy is implemented.
