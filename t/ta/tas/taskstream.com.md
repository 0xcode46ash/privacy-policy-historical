# Taskstream: Privacy

  1. Taskstream has created this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) in order to communicate its policies and practices relating to the collection, use and disclosure of information about you, the end user. Taskstream has drafted this statement in order to convey a firm commitment to your privacy as an end user of the Taskstream website, and all services supplied by Taskstream connected therewith (the “Site” and the “Services,” respectively).
  2. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, which may be changed or updated periodically.
  3. If you decide to use the Site, or by agreeing to the Taskstream End User Agreement, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your information on the terms described in this Privacy Policy, as modified from time to time.



## What information does Taskstream collect, and how?

  1. In order to gain access to the Site and take advantage of the Services, you will need to provide information as part of a registration process, including your name. Taskstream requests this information from you in order to enhance, quantify and measure your use of the Site. Our registration form will also ask you to give us your contact information (name, telephone number and email address) and you have the option of supplying demographic and other information (like Zip code, school district, grade level and subject you are in or you teach).
  2. “Cookies” are small pieces of information transferred from a website to the hard drive of computers through your Internet browser. Most browsers automatically accept Cookies, but can be configured to refuse them. We may use Cookies in very limited instances for connection purposes on certain browsers. The information collected does not contain anything personal to the end user and is discarded daily. Third party websites, which can be accessed through links on the Site, may use Cookies and similar devices to collect information about users, including information relating to products and services accessed, or advertising clicked on by a user, and websites visited by a user after leaving their websites. Taskstream shall not be responsible for such practices that take place once you leave the Site.



## Disclosure of Information

  1. Taskstream actively seeks to comply with all applicable statutes and regulations regarding maintaining the confidentiality and privacy of information held by it, including but not limited to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”). Taskstream does not sell or otherwise transfer customer information to third-party marketing companies under any circumstances. It is Taskstream’s policy not to share your personal information with any third parties, other than in the limited circumstances set out below.
  2. Taskstream enables you to comply with your privacy and confidentiality obligations. However, you must be aware of your own obligations under FERPA or any other statute, regulation or other legal or institutional rule regarding the release of confidential information and act accordingly. You may participate in a variety of online forums on the Site, submit work to others for evaluation, share work with colleagues, and/or publish work in Taskstream or to the World Wide Web at large. Any information you disclose in these areas will be available to certain other end users, and may be collected and used by persons other than Taskstream. You should not disclose any information that you do not want others to know on these areas of the Site. Taskstream does not routinely monitor these areas, and you use forums and tools at your own risk. In addition, you may also provide us with information such as your name, subject and grade / university level that you are in or that you teach, contact email address (if supplied), lesson plans, assignments, work product, and assessment rubrics, that identifies your own content. This information will be available only to other individuals’ Taskstream IDs and passwords within your organization UNLESS YOU CHOOSE TO PUBLISH IT ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB. Personal information such as addresses and phone numbers are NEVER published on the Site by Taskstream and should not be by you unless you are sure that your audience is allowed to have such information.
  3. Taskstream provides various communication tools that enable users to share work with users and non-users of Taskstream. Once you have shared work with a third party, Taskstream no longer can control access to that work and can make no assurances as to the privacy of that work. Do not disclose or send information to third parties that you do not want others to know, use or publish in other forums.
  4. Taskstream may disclose your information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable law, a subpoena or other legal process. We may also disclose such information as is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against a person or entity who may be violating Taskstream’s Terms of Use (or such other agreements to which an end user is a party), or who may be causing injury to, or interfering with, other users of the Site and Services, or other third parties who may be harmed by such activities. In addition, in the event that all or part of Taskstream’s assets are acquired by a third party, user information may be included in the transferred assets.



## Receiving Information and Surveys by Email

Taskstream also provides you with the opportunity to receive information and take customer surveys related to the Site and Services, by email. If you do not want to receive such information by email, you may opt out of further communications sent by Taskstream at any time by sending us an email at privacy@taskstream.com or by calling us at 1.800.311.5656. Please note that we can only comply with requests relating to email communication sent by Taskstream. If you no longer wish to receive further information by email from any third party, you will need to contact such third party directly to opt out of further communications being sent to you.

Taskstream has no control over the content, policies or actions of these websites, even if you are offered products or services on those websites because you are an end user of the Site and Services. The use of any information you may provide to third parties on other websites, or which such parties may otherwise collect on other websites, is not governed by this Privacy Policy. You should carefully review the privacy policies of any third-party websites and contact the operators of those websites if you have any questions about their use of your information. Taskstream cannot be responsible for any third party, or its affiliates or agents, failing to use your information in accordance with such third party’s privacy policy, or any contractual or other legal obligations to which such third party, its affiliates or agents, may be subject.
