# Taste and Discover Wines from Around the World at TastingRoom.com

TastingRoom.com is committed to protecting the privacy of its customers. Our site has been designed and built with our customers’ privacy and security front of mind. These principles guide our privacy policy: 

  * We will not, under any circumstances, sell your personal information to anyone or any company.
  * This policy does not apply to the practices of individuals we do not employ or manage, or to companies we do not own or control, including without limitation the practices of third party websites that you may access through a link on our website.
  * We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide certain services to you, such as shipping and credit card processing. We also are affiliated with a variety of businesses, including wineries, whose products may be sold to you through our website. We may need to share some of your personal information with them, but these companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information beyond what is necessary to assist us.
  * No registration is required in order to use this website, though a user must provide personal information prior to completing any purchase. Customers making a purchase are required to provide personal information such as name, email, and shipping address; financial information such as credit card number, expiration date, billing address; and birth date. This information is necessary in order for us to contact users to confirm orders, facilitate shipping and billing, and to confirm the customer is of legal age; if you do not provide all the required information, you will not be able to complete a purchase through our site. It is optional for users to provide a phone number, but we encourage you to do so in order to have an alternate means of contact regarding an order.
  * When you place an order on our website, you will be prompted to become a registered user by creating a User Account. Again, registration is not required, but creating a User Account makes check-out easier the next time you place an order. You will be required to provide a password for your User Account, and you may edit it at any time. The following information which you provided upon placing your order, will be saved to your User Account, and you may edit it at any time: name, birthdate, phone number (if you provided one), email address, and preferences as to what types of emails you wish to receive from us (if you noted such preferences.) Your order history will also be saved to your User Account; it will contain the following information about each past order, which is not editable: order date, order number, whether the order was a gift or not, total cost of the order, wine bottles and samplers in the order, and a link to the order invoice. You will have the ability to keep yourself signed into your User Account for 90 days if you wish, but please do not choose that option on a public computer, and please maintain the confidentiality of your password at all times.
  * When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted with the best SSL (Secure Socket Layers) encryption. Our third party e-commerce providers, who manage billing and payment processing for our site, also use SSL encryption technology.
  * We automatically receive and store certain types of information about you whenever you visit our site, such as your IP address and cookie information. This is general information about your location and usage of the site, and we will not combine it with any personal information you provide to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is. We may use this non-personally identifiable information to improve and customize the content you see on TastingRoom.com and to generally enhance your experience on the website. 
  * If you provide us with an email address, we may send you promotional offers and other emails. If you do not wish to receive email from us, please unsubscribe using the link at the bottom of the email. Please note that we may send legal notices via email, so if you’ve opted out of receiving correspondence from us, you are responsible for reviewing all legal notices on our website.
  * We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page. 
  * We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.
  * In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets, and, in that event, your information may be transferred to or acquired by a third party. If that happens, you agree that the third party may continue to use your information as set forth in this policy.
  * California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of TastingRoom.com who are California residents to request certain information regarding its disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, or if you have any other questions regarding our Privacy Policy, please send an e-mail to [privacy@TastingRoom.com](mailto:privacy@TastingRoom.com).
