**Aggregate and Non-Personal Information**

We collect certain aggregate and non-personal information when you visit our website. Aggregate and non-personal information does not relate to a single, identifiable visitor. It tells us such things as how many users visited our site, the pages accessed, the information downloaded and the type of web browser and operating system used. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our website to our visitors. We collect this information either through "cookie" technology or with "web beacons," as explained below. 

> Cookies 
> 
> Like many companies, we use "cookies" on our website. Cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer's hard drive when you visit certain websites. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site. 
> 
> When you visit our website, cookies are placed on your computer. We use cookies to tell us, for example, whether you've visited us before or if you're a new visitor and to help us identify site features and recipes in which you may have the greatest interest. We collect this information to enhance your experience on our website. 
> 
> The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. Remember, though, without cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of all of our website features. 
> 
> Web Beacons 
> 
> Certain pages on our site contain "web beacons" (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). These web beacons allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the third party. 

  
**How We Use Personally Identifiable Information**

We may use the information you provide to contact you from time to time. For example, we may (i) send you promotional materials and other communications you request, (ii) respond to your comments or questions, or (iii) contact you if needed while processing a product or service you requested through our website. We also may use the information you provide to contact you for your opinions on our products or the website. 

We also use personally identifiable information about you to improve our website features and content and to analyze website usage. In addition, we use personally identifiable information for market research purposes. We also may use Personally identifiable information about you to deliver content that is customized to your interests as we understand them from the information you've provided to us and your activities on the site. This customized content may include product information and promotions. 

**How We Share Personally Identifiable Information**

Except as described below, we don't sell, transfer or otherwise disclose to third parties the Personally identifiable information we collect on this website without your prior consent. We disclose information where we think it's necessary to investigate or prevent an actual or suspected crime or injury to ourselves or others or where disclosure is required by law. We also may disclose information in response to a request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials. We also disclose information to third parties we retain to perform services on our behalf. For example, we hire service providers to help us run promotions, fulfill orders you may place and provide customer service. These service providers may have access to Personally identifiable information about our website visitors if it is needed to perform their functions for Tassimo, but they are not authorized by Tassimo to use the information for their own marketing purposes. 

On our website, we may conduct joint promotions with other companies. We may share with our promotional partners (and their service providers) certain Personally identifiable information as necessary to conduct the promotion. We will not share this information with our promotional partners for any other purpose unless you tell us it's ok to do so. 

We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use personal information provided through this website in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice. 

**Links To Other Websites**

This website may contain links to other websites. We provide these links solely for your convenience and information. Different websites have different privacy practices. You should always check the privacy notice of the specific site you're visiting to understand the privacy practices associated with that site. 

**Your Choices**

You can change your preferences for follow-up contacts just by e-mailing us or by changing the information you've provided to us in the "Your Profile" section of the site. If you prefer, you can cancel your registration altogether. E-mail us if you wish to take this action. 

**How We Protect Personally Identifiable Information**

The security of Personally identifiable information is important to us. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized use, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the Personally identifiable information we collect on this website. 

**Updates To This Privacy Notice**
