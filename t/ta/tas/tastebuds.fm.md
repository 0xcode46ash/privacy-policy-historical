# Privacy Policy - Tastebuds

## Tastebuds Privacy Policy

Tastebuds.fm (the "Site"), operated solely by Tastebuds Media Ltd. ("we" or "us"), respects the privacy of our users and has developed this privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") to articulate our commitment to protecting your privacy. 

The Privacy Policy is intended to describe for you, as an individual who is a user of the Site or of the services offered on the Site (collectively with the Site, the "Services"), the information we collect, how that information may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your choices about such uses and disclosures. 

We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using the Services. By accessing the Services, you acknowledge and agree that you have read, fully accept, and will abide by this Privacy Policy. 

The Services are currently under intense development and different aspects of the Services will be deployed over the coming months. Some parts of this Privacy Policy refer to functions of the Services that have not yet been implemented or deployed. Once such functions are available for use, by accessing and continuing to use the Services thereafter, you agree that those parts of the Privacy Policy shall go into effect. 

  1. ### 1\. Information collected

When you register as a Member and set up a profile certain information is required. This includes personally identifiable information such as your name and email address. This information is stored on our systems, but NO personally identifiable information is ever displayed in your public profile or included in any communication between Members sent via the site.

  2. ### 2\. Updating your information

You can freely update all of your personal information including username, email address, location, password and all profile details. We encourage you to keep your details up to date.

  3. ### 3\. Your password

It is vital that you keep your password safe to prevent unauthorised access to your personal information. If you believe that your password has been compromised for any reason please CHANGE it immediately.

  4. ### 4\. Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive that allows us to recognise your computer from one page access to the next. We use persistent cookies in order to keep you logged in to the site after you close your browser. We therefore recommended logging out of the site on shared computers after use. If you configure your browser to reject cookies, you may still use some, but not all, portions of our site. For example, the login process and all member functionality requires that your browser accept cookies.

  5. ### 5\. Deleting your information

You have the option to hide your profile at any time which will remove it from public view on our system. If you would like to permanently delete your account please visit the Settings page of the site. Deletion will permanently remove your photos and profile information from our database. Support enquiries sent to us may be stored on file.

  6. ### 6\. Internal use of information

We may internally use your information to improve our services, analyse site usage, optimise content, etc. This will only be conducted by authorised staff members of Tastebuds.fm. We may use personally identifiable information to troubleshoot problems and implement our terms and conditions.

  7. ### 7\. Disclosure of your information

Our general disclosure policy is as follows:

    * We will not disclose any of your information without your permission.
    * We will not supply any Member's details to any other Member - please don't even ask us.
    * We will not sell or rent or give your information to any third party unless you give us permission to do so.

You will receive essential service related emails from us and you may receive anonymous emails from other Members. You will only receive emails from Tastebuds.fm that relate to other services or offerings if you have expressly opted in to receive such communications. If you do opt in to receive such communications, Tastebuds.fm may analyse your profile information in order to send you information about those services or offerings that Tastebuds.fm believes may be of most interest to you.

  10. ### 10\. Security

Our technical teams do their utmost to ensure the security of our systems. Internet Security is a complex topic and no system can be considered 100% secure. Should a security breach occur we would endeavour to react as fast as possible to remedy the problem. However we cannot assume responsibility for Member details compromised in the unlikely event of a security breach.

  11. ### 11\. Changes to this policy

If we make material changes to our privacy policy, these changes will be posted to our privacy policy page. You should review this page regularly for updates.
