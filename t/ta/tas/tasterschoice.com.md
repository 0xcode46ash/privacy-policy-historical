**Personal Information Use**

We collect personal information, like names, addresses, email addresses, etc., when voluntarily submitted by our online visitors.

Individuals on this mailing list may also receive joint offers from Nestlé which feature products from other reputable organizations and companies. Your information is not sold or transferred to these other companies.

Your information is kept secure. Only authorized Nestlé employees and their agents (who have agreed to keep information secure) have access to stored information. If you no longer want to receive information from Nestlé, and you have given us your name and address via the Contact Us section or the sample section, you may contact us at 1-800-637-8531 or send us a new email from the Contact Us section. Please let us know how we initially received your information. Whenever you receive an email from this site, you will also be given the opportunity to opt out of future mailings.
