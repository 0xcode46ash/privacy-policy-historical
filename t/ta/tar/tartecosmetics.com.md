In support of this, we only use the personal information that you provide to create a more personalized and entertaining experience for you, in accordance with the terms outlined below.

This Privacy Policy covers any personal information we obtain when you visit us, use our services, or access the features on the websites that Tarte owns or controls (today or in the future), including [www.tarte.com](http://www.tarte.com/) and [www.tartecosmetics.com](http://www.tartecosmetics.com/) (the Sites). You can access the Sites in many ways, including from a computer or mobile phone, and this Privacy Policy will apply regardless of the means of access. This Privacy Policy also governs the information we obtain from you from any third party site where we post content or invite your feedback or participation, including, but not limited to, [ http://twitter.com/tartecosmetics](http://twitter.com/tartecosmetics),[ www.facebook.com/tartecosmetics ](http://www.facebook.com/tartecosmetics), and including [www.youtube.com/user/tartecosmetics](http://www.youtube.com/user/tartecosmetics) (Third Party Sites). Tarte cannot control the privacy policies of Third Party Sites or of companies Tarte does not own or control, and cannot control the actions of people Tarte does not employ or manage. You should always check the privacy policies of Third Party Sites and your privacy settings. 

**personal information we collect**

You have many ways to provide information to Tarte. 

You can create a personal shopping account with Tarte. This account will allow you to shop faster and easier, and to check on order status and history. You will also be a member of Tarte Tokens, our loyalty program. In creating this account, you authorize Tarte to store your name, birthday, email address, telephone number and shipping and billing addresses. You should keep your account information current and complete. Your account will have a password that you will create. You may not use another person’s account or password without their permission and you should protect the confidentiality of your account and password information by logging out of your account at the end of each shopping session. 

You can be added to the Tarte mailing list; subscriptions to the mailing list can be cancelled at any time. 

You can participate in Tarte contests, sweepstakes and promotions. As part of your participation, we may request your name, mailing address, e-mail address and other information in order to administer the promotion, notify winners, etc. 

When you submit a request, review or comment to our customer service department or participate in any interactive services Tarte offers (today or in the future), we may ask you for your e-mail address so we can follow up with you and we may obtain other personal information about you. 

When you complete a survey on-line, we may ask for certain information from you, including your age, zip code, shopping habits, e-mail and/or mailing address. 

When you place an order on our Sites, we will use your information to process and fill your order. We may send you an e-mail to confirm or update you on your order. We may also need to contact you by regular mail, e-mail or phone if we have any questions regarding your order. 

If you share information about yourself in an open format, like on a Third Party Site or in the user-generated content portions of our Sites, Tarte considers that information to be public information and not personal information. Use caution when posting your own content. Individuals under the age of 18 should be especially careful not to provide any personally identifiable information when participating in any area of the Sites where user-generated content might be available to the public. Please see our Terms of Service for the standards of behavior that must be followed when using these portions of the Sites and the Third Party Sites. 

**how we use your personal information**

From time to time, we will use the information you provide to us to send you e-mail or regular mail regarding products, services, contests and promotions that we think may be of interest to you. We may also use information you provide to us to personalize your shopping experience by using your product interests and purchase information to recommend other products, services or promotions that we believe may interest you, including those of other companies. We may also notify you of functionality changes to the Sites.

Tarte may share your personal information with our marketing or advertising partners and with companies that perform services for us, such as fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, analyzing customer data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, storing of data on external servers, investigating fraudulent activity, conducting customer surveys and providing customer service. Even with this access to personal information necessary to perform these functions, those third parties may not disclose your information for any other purposes. Tarte may disclose personal information if required by law or legal process.

Tarte does not sell, rent or license the information of our customers. If we change this policy, we will post a notice in this Privacy Policy and on our home page. However, in the event that another company buys the assets or stock of Tarte, your personal information may then belong to another entity. 

**cookies, pixel tags and tracking**

Tarte has a number of ways that it can offer better service and improve the shopping experience on our Sites. 

We collect information about how you use our Sites by setting and accessing cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small piece of information sent by our Sites that is saved on your hard drive by your computer's browser. The cookie holds information our Sites may need to personalize or enhance your experience and to gather statistical data, such as which pages are visited, the internet provider's domain name and the addresses of the sites visited immediately before coming to and immediately after leaving the Sites. The information in the cookie lets Tarte trace "clickstream" activity (i.e., the paths taken by visitors to our Sites as they move from page to page) to enable us to better serve our customers by revealing which portions of our Sites are the most popular. Cookies also help us improve your shopping experience by, among other things, keeping track of your preferences, recognizing you if you have a shopping account, and tracking your shopping basket as you shop. Cookies contain absolutely no personal information so if any of your personal information needs to be accessed during your visit to the Sites, you will have to log in or otherwise authenticate yourself. We may link the anonymous visitor ID from your cookie to a user ID in our database to help us analyze web traffic and statistics. From time to time, other companies may help us with data research and analysis, but they will be prohibited from using that data for any other purpose. You may disable cookies on your browser. Please review your browser's instructions for doing so. Note that certain features of the Sites may not be available if you delete or reject cookies.

We may use pixel tags (also called web beacons or “clear” gifs) on our Sites. They can help us analyze what our customers like to do on our Sites and the effectiveness of our features and advertising. They can also help us customize your browsing and shopping experience. We may use information collected through pixel tags or tracked links in combination with your personal information. We may also combine personal information you provide to Tarte with other personal information (such as purchase history and demographic information). If we work with other companies to help us track, collect and analyze this information, they will be prohibited from using this information for any other purpose.

Tarte may also work with advertising partners that use cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies to serve advertisements on behalf of their retail clients (like Tarte), across the Internet, including to you after you have visited our Sites. These advertising partners engage in remarketing, online behavioral advertising and ad delivery and reporting. With respect to Tarte, these advertising partners may collect anonymous information about your browser as it makes visits to websites across the Internet (including our Sites) and your interaction with our advertising and email communications. This anonymous information may also be used to tailor advertising for you and others elsewhere on the Internet. Tarte will have access to the information collected by these advertising partners and can then use it in combination with personally identifiable information provided by you to enhance your experience on our Sites. We will not share that personally identifiable information with these advertising partners. If you would like more information about this practice or would like to know your choices about not having your information used by these companies, please visit [ http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp ](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp)

**secure shopping**

Tarte goes to great lengths to keep financial information you provide to us private and safe. We use Secure Socket Layers (SSL), the industry standard in transferring information to process your orders. The SSL encrypts, or translates, your order information into a highly indecipherable code, which is processed immediately. All credit card transactions occur in a secure area of our site, to protect you from any loss, misuse or alteration of information collected. When you have finished shopping and begin the checkout process, you will move into the secure area of our site. Once you've entered, the page address (URL) will change from http to https, to let you know you are in a secure area. You acknowledge, however, that no transmission of data over the Internet or mobile phone devices can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, despite our efforts. We also cannot protect financial or personal information that is not under our control. Thus, while we will use every means possible to ensure the security of information you transmit to us, we cannot guarantee that such information will not be intercepted by third parties. 

**social commerce and third party sites**

We work with third parties, including social network sites like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, and with application developers who specialize in social commerce so we can connect to your social networks. All of these companies operate Third Party Sites. We provide access to our Sites by third parties and business partners so we can generate interest in our products among members of your social networks and to allow you to share product interests with friends in your network.

The use of any features made available to you on our Sites by a third party may result in information being collected or shared about you by us or by the third party. Information collected or shared through any such third party features is considered “public information” by us because the Third Party Sites made it publicly available. If you do not want us to be able to access information about you from Third Party Sites, you must instruct Third Party Sites not to share the information. Tarte is not responsible for how these third parties may use information collected from or about you so be sure to review the privacy policies and privacy settings on your social networking sites to make sure you understand the information they are sharing. If you do not want a Third Party Site to share information about you, you must contact that site and determine whether it gives you the opportunity to opt out of sharing such information. However, we do identify any areas on our Sites where third parties share information about you.

We use features on Third Party Sites that allow you to express positive opinions about our products or purchase our products. Those Third Party Sites may collect or register your views about our products (including whether you purchased a product) and make those views available to Tarte and on public portions of the Third Party Sites.., If you do not wish any of this to happen, you should not express your views about our products on Third Party Sites, you should not buy our products through Third Party Sites, and you should review your privacy settings on such Third Party Sites. We are not obligated to display someone’s name, profile photo or other “public” information on our Sites even if they express an opinion about one of our products. We reserve the right to remove the information of any person for any reason. We may also remove from our Sites, in our sole discretion, any product offering or any photo or product description relating thereto. 

**children**

In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, Tarte will never knowingly request, accept or use personal information from children under 13 years of age. The Sites are not designed for children. If you are under 13 and want to make a purchase, please have a parent place the order for you. If Tarte receives actual knowledge that a shopping account has been opened by someone under 13 years of age or information has been provided by someone under 13, Tarte will eliminate all personal information relating to that individual from our records. 

**your consent**

You acknowledge that this Privacy Policy is part of the terms of service for your use of the Sites, and you agree that using the Sites signifies your assent to Tarte, Inc.'s Privacy Policy. Tarte reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time, without advance notice. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it. If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy that affect the way we use personal information we have already collected from you, we will get your consent to those changes. 

If you have any questions about your privacy or security on our Sites, please email us[ info@tartecosmetics.com ](mailto:%20info@tartecosmetics.com)and include your name and the address in the message.
