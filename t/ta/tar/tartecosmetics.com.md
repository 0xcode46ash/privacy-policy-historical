2\. Cookies

A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a website that is saved on your hard drive by your computer's browser. The cookie holds information a site may need to personalize/enhance your experience and to gather website statistical data, such as which pages are visited, the internet provider's domain name and the addresses of the sites visited immediately before coming to and immediately after leaving www.toryburch.com. However, none of this information is associated with you as an individual. It is measured anonymously and only in the aggregate. The information in the cookies lets Tarte, Inc. trace your "clickstream" activity (i.e., the paths taken by visitors to our site as they move from page to page) to enable us to better serve our customers by revealing which portions of our site are the most popular. Cookies contain absolutely no personal information. You may disable cookies on your browser. Please review your browser's instructions for doing so. 

3\. Your Security

Tarte, Inc. goes to great lengths to keep your financial information private and safe. We use Secure Socket Layers (SSL), the industry standard in transferring information to process your orders. The SSL encrypts, or translates, your order information into a highly indecipherable code, which is processed immediately. All credit card transactions occur in a secure area of our site, to protect you from any loss, misuse or alteration of information collected. When you have finished shopping and begin the checkout process, you will move into the secure area of our site. Once you've entered, the page address (URL) will change from http to https, to let you know you are in a secure area. You acknowledge, however, that no transmission of data over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, despite our best efforts. Thus, while we will use every means possible to ensure the security of information you transmit to us, we cannot guarantee that such information will not be intercepted by third parties. 

4\. Children

In compliance with the Children's Privacy Protection Act of 1998, Tarte, Inc. will never knowingly request or use personal information from children under 13 years of age without prior parental consent. If borba.net receives actual knowledge that a subscriber is under 13 years of age, Tarte, Inc. will eliminate all personal information relating to this subscriber from our files.

Tarte, Inc. reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time, without advanced notice.
