|  Privacy Policy   
---  
We at targus.com are committed to preserving your privacy and the privacy of all visitors or customers. Information we collect is used to process orders and create a better shopping experience for our customers.   
When you place an order, we collect basic contact information so that we know who to bill and ship the order to. Your email address is used to send you status reports on your order. Credit card information is used to bill you for products or services. We sometimes use this information to communicate with you through mailings or to contact you about your account with us. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings from us; see the choice/opt-out section below. We also may disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law.   
Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to preserve your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit. Cookies are small files stored on your computer by a web site to give you a unique ID and are set to expire. A cookie generated by our site contains no information about you.   
We may use customer information in aggregate to create statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information. These statistics will not include personal identifying information and are for internal purposes only.   
When you visit targus.com, we may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information.   
Security  
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We use VeriSign OnSiteSM on our shopping cart to offer you leading cryptographic techniques, and secure facilities to give you complete confidence in our site. This includes online ordering, order status, account information, and email information.

Sharing  
We partner with WhatCounts to provide e-mail communications services. When the user signs up for these services, we will provide WhatCounts with names, or other contact information that is necessary for WhatCounts to fulfill these services.   
WhatCounts is not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. WhatCounts is not allowed to share personal information with any third party.
