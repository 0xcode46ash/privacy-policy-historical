# Privacy Statement :: Tarot.com

| 

Visionary's websites use passwords in order to customize and protect what are essentially private experiences. We are not interested in personal information -- we don't need it and we dont expect it \-- while still giving you a way to customize the website experience to please yourself. 

We will accept personal contact information when it is necesssary for ecommerce or customer service (shipping, etc.). In no case, however, is any personal or financial information ever shared, rented or sold. 

Visionary may gather information in the following processes:   
**Customization/Preference Settings**   
Users may access custom readings and other special features of the sites without having to log in each time. Registrants will enjoy the benefits of customization, based on preferences they have specified to the website (for saved readings, one's favorite Tarot deck, etc.). But your account remains essentially anonymous -- no personal information is required for an account.   
**Demographic Information**   
Demographic information, which is only accepted on a voluntary basis, is stored anonymously -- and is not linked to individual records.   
**Product Purchases/Ecommerce**   
The purchase of Karma Coins, Gift Certificates and Expert Readings requires no personal information other than name and credit card number. Obviously, if you purchase something tangible, we need shipping, credit and contact information. We will make it possible for customers to have us set up their credit card information to speed up future purchases, but only if they choose to do so. In any case, no personal or financial information is ever rented or sold.   
**E-mail Newsletter**   
We offer a free e-mail newsletter. We retain the e-mail addresses of only users who voluntarily subscribe to the site or the newsletter. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by sending an email (any email) to unsubscribe@tarot.com. Visionary abides by a 'no-spam' email policy. Sometimes friends subscribe friends, but we never knowingly send an unsolicited or unwanted email newseltter and always offer an easy way to unsubscribe. 

Personal Data Protection   
We take extraordinary precautions to keep all customer information absolutely secure. 

Limited Possible Assignment of Information   
Provided that such a transfer includes the requirement to abide by the conditions and limitations of Visionary's Privacy Policy, it is understood that Visionary Networks could possibly assign, sell, license, or otherwise transfer to a third party all website and customer information in order to finalize an assignment, sale, joint venture, or other transfer involving a portion or all of the assets or stock of Visionary Networks, Inc. Such an event is not anticipated, but since anything is possible, it needs to be mentioned as a remote possibility. The bottom line is that preservation of Tarot.com's Privacy Policy would be required if the company were ever to be merged or acquired.
