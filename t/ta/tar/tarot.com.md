# Tarot.com :: Tarot, Astrology, Numerology & I-Ching

Tarot.com use passwords in order to customize and protect what are essentially private experiences. We collect minimal personal information – enough to allow us to customize Daily Horoscopes and Astrology and Numerology reports – while giving you ways to customize your web site experience to please yourself. 

## We Adhere to a Strict Anti-Spam Policy

Here at Tarot.com we are 100% committed to protecting your privacy. We won't reveal or rent your email address to third parties. We won't send you emails if you don't want to receive them, either. 

When you first sign-up, we send out an email receipt welcoming you and confirming your login name and password. You will also receive an occasional promotional email from Tarot.com only – this is our way of notifying you about free readings, reports or new feature updates. But we never ever share addresses with anyone else. If you decide at any time that you want to stop receiving our member-benefits emails, you can opt-out by following the instructions at the end of every email or by visiting the "About You" area of the website. 

If you choose to unsubscribe, but in the future decide you would like to start receiving the free gifts and updates again, you can easily re-subscribe in "About You" at any time. But until then, you can rest assured that we will honor your preference by removing your name from our internal list. 

## Information Gathered for Customization & Purchasing

Tarot.com may gather information for the following reasons:

> **Customization/Preference Settings**  
>  Based on your chosen settings, you may access custom readings and other special features of the site without having to log in each time. Registrants will enjoy the benefits of customization, based on preferences they have specified to the website (for saved readings, one's favorite Tarot deck, etc.). But your account remains essentially anonymous. 
> 
> **Product Purchases / Ecommerce**  
>  Purchasing online at Tarot.com is completely secure. The purchase of Karma Coins, Gift Certificates and Expert Readings requires no personal information other than name and credit card number, expiration date, etc. Obviously, if you purchase something tangible from the Tarot.com store, we need shipping and contact information as well. Our secure system stores some of this information for your convenience in the future, but no personal or financial information is ever shared, rented or sold. 
> 
> **Surveys**  
>  Demographic information that is accepted on a voluntary basis via surveys is stored anonymously – and is not linked to individual records. 

## Your Personal Data Is Always Protected

We take extraordinary precautions to keep all customer information absolutely secure. We want you to be able to use our site as a personal resource for as long as you want, with complete confidence. Your unique user login and password protect your stored readings and reports, so that you – and only you – can access them anytime. 

> **Personal Online Journals**  
>  All full-sized readings and reports are saved for users in "Your Readings and Reports Journal", which you can find under the "About You" menu on every regular page of the websites. This information – which consists of Tarot Readings, I-Ching Readings and Astrology and Numerology Reports – is saved for your convenience or analysis only, and any items in your Journal can be easily deleted by you anytime you want. These items are completely protected by your password and are not used by anyone else for any purpose.
