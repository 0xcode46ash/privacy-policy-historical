# Target Australia Pty Ltd - Privacy

Your privacy is very important to us and we will always act to protect your information. Target takes this responsibility seriously and is very careful about how and when your personal information is collected, used and shared.

This statement tells you in general terms what our commitment is, why we need to collect personal information, who we may share that information with outside of Target and how you may access the information that we keep.

We will always make sure that we handle your personal information securely and carefully and will only use your personal information when  
it is necessary for us to deliver you a service or perform other necessary business functions and activities. We will not use your information for purposes unrelated to the services we provide, unless first obtaining your consent. Wherever possible, we will give you the option of interacting anonymously with us provided it is practicable and lawful to do so. We will always use fair and lawful means of collecting personal information. In most circumstances we will collect personal information directly from you.
