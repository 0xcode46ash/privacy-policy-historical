## Information Automatically Collected Online

Target uses cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with Target through your computer or mobile device. For example, the information may include the pages you visit on our site, which web address you came from, and the type of browser you are using. Target also uses web beacons or similar technologies to collect certain information when you receive and open e-mail communications from us. For example, the information may include the date/time you first opened our e-mail to you, the number of times it was opened, the number of click-throughs on any links in our e-mail to you. This information helps us customize your website experience and make our marketing messages more relevant and effective. We also use this information for internal reporting and analysis purposes, such as how you are using our website and performance of our marketing efforts. 

Target allows service providers and third-party companies to collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit our websites and to use that information to serve ads for Target products or services or other companies’ products or services when you visit target.ca or other websites. The information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) is used during your visits to Target’s websites and other websites to provide advertisements about products and services that also may be of interest to you. These parties typically use a cookie or a web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioural advertising practice or to manage your choices (for example, opt in or opt out) for this type of advertising, you can visit the [ Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada  ](http://youradchoices.ca/ "open in a new window").

## Information From Other Sources

We may also obtain information from other sources that help us analyze, update, expand our records (for example, updating contact information or adding demographic information) and identify new guests. These companies must follow privacy laws when collecting and sharing the information with Target. Target uses the information to improve our ability to contact you and increase the relevance of our marketing to you. 

## How is this Personal information Used?

Examples of how we use your personal information include:

## How is this Information Shared?

#### The Target Family

We share personal information we collect within the Target family, which includes Target’s corporate parent (Target Corporation), subsidiaries and affiliates. When your personal information is shared within the Target family, it will still be used and protected according to this Privacy Policy. 

#### Service Providers

When needed in order to perform their services, we may share personal information with companies and affiliates who: 

  * Provide support services (such as a printing, shipping, e-mail, or mobile marketing),
  * Help market our products and services, or
  * Assist us to carry out one or more of the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.



These companies are not authorized to use the personal information that we share with them or that they collect on our behalf for any other purpose. In addition, they are required to appropriately protect the personal information and comply with applicable privacy laws. 

#### International Sharing

Target and the Target family have international offices and service providers. Accordingly, your personal information may be processed or stored outside of Canada, including in the United States, India and other countries. In accordance with the laws of those countries, in certain circumstances your personal information may be accessible by foreign law enforcement, regulatory bodies or other authorities. For more information about our use of foreign service providers, please contact us as described below. 

#### Legal Requirements

We may disclose personal information you provide to us when we believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law; to enforce or apply applicable terms and conditions and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, health or safety of our company, our guests, our team members or others. 

#### Sharing with Other Companies (for their marketing purposes)

With your consent, we may share your personal information with other companies which are not part of the Target family. These companies may use the personal information we share to provide special offers and opportunities directly to you. 

#### Business Transfers

Your personal information may be disclosed or transferred to an affiliate or third party in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, sale, merger, transfer, reorganization or similar transaction involving all or part of Target’s business or assets. The disclosure or transfer would be made so you would continue to receive the same or similar products and services from the affiliate or third party. Target may retain a copy of the personal information involved if it is still necessary for our reasonable business purposes. 

## What Choices Do You Have?

#### Consent

Target will only collect, use and disclose your personal information with your consent, except where otherwise permitted or required by law. The method of consent will be appropriate for the type of personal information involved and the purposes for which it will be collected, used or shared. If the purpose for obtaining your personal information is not clear from the context or if the personal information is sensitive, express consent is generally required. In other words, you need to agree either verbally, in writing or electronically. In cases where the purpose is obvious, your consent will be implied (for example, processing your credit card in order for you to buy an item). 

#### Marketing Preferences

You have choices about what marketing materials you would like to receive. You must opt in to receiving certain marketing materials (for example, text or phone messages). In other words, we will not send the materials to you without your express consent. Some marketing materials may be sent to you unless you opt out of receiving them (for example, emails where we have an existing business relationship with you). 

Information on how you can change your marketing preferences is listed below: 

  * Postal Mail & Telephone: If you do not wish to receive catalogs, coupons, promotional mail, or promotional phone calls, then contact us to opt out. 
  * E-mail: You have the ability to unsubscribe from promotional e-mails via the opt out link included in each e-mail or contact us to opt out. 
  * Mobile: We may distribute mobile coupons and text messages to mobile devices of guests who have requested this information via an opt in request. Text “stop” to opt out of a specific mobile messaging campaign or text "stop all" to opt out of all mobile messaging. 
  * Sharing with Other Companies (for their marketing purposes): If you do not wish us to share information with other companies (for their marketing purposes), contact us to opt out. 
  * Cookies: Your web browser’s help function should contain instructions to set your computer to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or to not receive cookies at any time. Note that if you set your computer to not receive cookies at any time, you will still be able to use Target's websites but certain personalized services cannot be provided to you. Accordingly, you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the features. 
  * Third Party Cookies: To opt out of certain third-party cookies and make selections about what online advertisement you choose to receive, visit the [ Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada  ](http://youradchoices.ca/ "open in a new window"). 



## How Do You Access and Update Your Personal Information?

In order to keep your personal information accurate and complete, you can access or update your personal information by contacting us and letting us know what personal information you are interested in accessing or updating. 

Subject to certain legal exceptions, we will provide you the personal information requested if reasonably available, or will describe the types of personal information we typically collect. 

## How is Personal Information Protected?

#### Security Methods

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss, theft and unauthorized access. These safeguards will be appropriate for the sensitivity of your personal information. 

#### E-mail Security

"Phishing" is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an e-mail that looks like it is from us asking you for your personal information, do not respond. We will never request your password, user name, credit card information or other sensitive personal information through e-mail. 

#### Retention & Deletion

Your personal information is kept only as long as needed to fulfill the reasonable business purposes for which it was collected or for legal compliance. When no longer needed for these purposes, your personal information is either appropriately destroyed or is made anonymous by removing any information that could identify you.
