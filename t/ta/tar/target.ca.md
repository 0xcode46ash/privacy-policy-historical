## How is this Information Shared?

### The Target Family

We share personal information we collect within the Target family, which includes Target's corporate parent (Target Corporation), subsidiaries and affiliates. When your personal information is shared within theTarget family, it will still be used and protected according to this Privacy Policy. 

### Service Providers

When needed in order to perform their services, we may share personal information with companies and affiliates who:

  * Provide support services (such as a printing, shipping, e-mail, or mobile marketing),
  * Help market our products and services, or
  * Assist us to carry out one or more of the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.



These companies are not authorized to use the personal information that we share with them or that they collect on our behalf for any other purpose. In addition, they are required to appropriately protect the personal information and comply with applicable privacy laws.

### International Sharing

Target and the Target family have international offices and service providers. Accordingly, your personal information may be processed or stored outside of Canada, including in the United States, India and other countries. In accordance with the laws of those countries, in certain circumstances your personal information may be accessible by foreign law enforcement, regulatory bodies or other authorities. For more information about our use of foreign service providers, please contact us as described below.

### Legal Requirements

We may disclose personal information you provide to us when we believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law; to enforce or apply applicable terms and conditions and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, health or safety of our company, our guests, our team members or others.

### Sharing with Other Companies (for their marketing purposes)

With your consent, we may share your personal information with other companies which are not part of the Target family. These companies may use the personal information we share to provide special offers and opportunities directly to you.

### Business Transfers

Your personal information may be disclosed or transferred to an affiliate or third party in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, sale, merger, transfer, reorganization or similar transaction involving all or part of Target's business or assets. The disclosure or transfer would be made so you would continue to receive the same or similar products and services from the affiliate or third party. Target may retain a copy of the personal information involved if it is still necessary for our reasonable business purposes.

## What Choices Do You Have?

### Consent

Target will only collect, use and disclose your personal information with your consent, except where otherwise permitted or required by law. The method of consent will be appropriate for the type of personal information involved and the purposes for which it will be collected, used or shared. If the purpose for obtaining your personal information is not clear from the context or if the personal information is sensitive, express consent is generally required. In other words, you need to agree either verbally, in writing or electronically. In cases where the purpose is obvious, your consent will be implied (for example, processing your credit card in order for you to buy an item).

### Marketing Preferences

You have choices about what marketing materials you would like to receive. You must opt in to receiving certain marketing materials (for example, text or phone messages). In other words, we will not send the materials to you without your express consent. Some marketing materials will be sent to you unless you opt out of receiving them (for example, emails where we have an existing business relationship with you).

You can change your marketing preferences by mail, email or phone by contacting us as detailed below.

### Target Cookies

Your web browser's help function should contain instructions to set your computer to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or to not receive cookies at any time. If you set your computer to not receive cookies at any time, you will still be able to use the site but certain personalized services cannot be provided to you. Accordingly, you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the Target.ca features.

## How Do You Access and Update Your Personal Information?

In order to keep your personal information accurate and complete, you can access or update your personal information by contacting us and letting us know what personal information you are interested in accessing or updating.

Subject to certain legal exceptions, we will provide you the personal information requested if reasonably available, or will describe the types of personal information we typically collect.

## How is Personal Information Protected?

### Security Methods

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss, theft and unauthorized access. These safeguards will be appropriate for the sensitivity of your personal information.

### E-mail Security

"Phishing" is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an e-mail that looks like it is from us asking you for your personal information, do not respond. We will never request your password, user name, credit card information or other sensitive personal information through e-mail.

### Retention & Deletion

Your personal information is kept only as long as needed to fulfill the reasonable business purposes for which it was collected or for legal compliance. When no longer needed for these purposes, your personal information is either appropriately destroyed or is made anonymous by removing any information that could identify you.
