Texas A&M University (TAMU) respects your privacy. The University's main Webpage does not collect personal information about visitors. In particular, we do not use "cookies" to collect information.

Personal information that you provide via e-mail or through other online means will be used only for purposes necessary to serve your needs, such as responding to an inquiry or other request for information. This may involve redirecting your inquiry or comment to another person or department better suited to meeting your needs. 

  
We do, however, use server logs to collect information concerning your Internet connection and general information about your visit to our Web site. This information may be used to analyze trends; to create summary statistics for the purpose of determining technical design specifications; and to identify system performance or problem areas.  
  
This means we sometimes acquire, record and analyze portions of the data that is entered into, stored on, and/or transmitted through this site by you. This information is only released -- when legally required -- to help law enforcement investigations, legal proceedings or internal investigations of TAMU rule and regulation violations. These groups would use the information to track the electronic interactions back to the source computer(s) or account(s). 

Some web pages at Texas A&M University may collect personal information about visitors and use that information for purposes other than those stated above. Each web page that collects information will have a separate privacy statement that will tell you how that information is used.
