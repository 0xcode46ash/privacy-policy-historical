5.3 Cookies are used on this website for the following purposes:

  1. **_Session cookies:_** We use session cookies to enable the website to keep track of your movement from page to page and store your selections so you do not get asked repeatedly for the same information. These cookies allow you to proceed through many pages of the website quickly and easily without having to authenticate or reprocess each new area you visit. For example, the session cookie remembers your shopping cart selection so will have the items you selected when you are ready to check out.
  2. **_Cookie to store your settings:_** We use a persistent cookie (up to three years) to remember your settings such as your country, language and currency as well as any items you may add to the shopping basket, which are stored in a database on our secure server. This cookie enables you to have access to your settings and items if you return to the site.
  3. **_Google cookies:_** Persistent cookies (up to four years we believe) are set in connection with the following Google services on our site and these cookies may involve certain non-personally identifying information being sent to Google: 
    1. **_Google Analytics (“GA”):_** We use cookies to recognise and count the number of website visitors as well as providing other information about the visit such as duration, route through the website and what sites the visitor came from. This information helps us to improve the way our website works, for example by making sure users find what they need easily.

5.4 By continuing to use our website, having seen our cookie notice, we assume that you consent to use of the cookies outlined above.

**6\. How do we use your personal data?**

6.1 We use your personal data to provide our services, e.g. send service messages, process payments and/or fulfil orders.

6.2 We use your personal data to help us communicate with you effectively should you try to contact us via our website.

6.3 If you have given permission on our website, we may use your personal data to send you emails (or other communications such as mail, phone or SMS) with details of our or third party goods or services which may be of interest to you including information about special offers or promotions.

6.4 We may use personal data to recognize you when you visit or return to our website to track anonymised traffic and usage patterns, to prevent or detect fraud or abuses or to help us improve our website. We may use cookies to do this. See above.

6.5 If you supply us with a third party email address for a “Refer A Friend” or similar offer, we will use that email address only to transmit the referral message and we will then immediately delete it.

6.6 We retain personal data from closed accounts in order to comply with legal obligations, enforce our terms and conditions, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations and take other actions as permitted by law.

6.7 We may access, remove, alter, store or otherwise use any personal data if we have reason to believe that it breaches our terms and conditions, or that such steps are necessary to protect us or others, or that a criminal act has been committed, or if we are required to do so by law or appropriate authority.

**7\. How do we protect personal data?**

7.1 Security is a high priority for us. We take appropriate precautions to protect personal data.

7.2 Email and other electronic communications are not secure if they have not been encrypted. Your communications will pass through a number of network nodes before they reach us. So we do not accept responsibility for any unauthorised access to or loss of personal data that stems from a cause beyond our control. Nor can we be held responsible for the actions or omissions of other users or third parties who may misuse your personal data which they collect from the website.

**8\. To whom do we disclose personal data?**

8.1 Payment details including credit card numbers are supplied direct to our payment partner mentioned on our website. We do not receive such information. To ensure your details are not being used without consent, your personal data may be supplied by our payment partners to relevant third parties including credit reference and fraud prevention agencies, who may keep a record of that information.

8.2 We may allow access to your personal data by third parties who supply us with a service. Examples include e-commerce platform providers, couriers (to enable delivery of goods), website hosts, content delivery networks and businesses which assist us in undertaking communications or monitoring our website.

8.3 Email addresses and other contact information are provided to or collected by Mailchimp, who we use to send emails. Please see their privacy policy for more information.

8.4 We may disclose personal data so far as reasonably necessary:

  1. if we have reason to believe that it breaches our terms and conditions, or that such steps are necessary to protect us or others, or that a criminal act has been committed, or if there has been a complaint about content posted by you, or if we are required to do so by law or appropriate authority; or
  2. in the case of an actual or proposed (including negotiations for a) sale or merger or business combination involving all or the relevant part of our business.



8.5 We may store or transfer personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) for the purposes stated in this policy. If so, we will of course comply with the applicable laws relating to data transfer outside the EEA.

8.6 Except as otherwise specifically included in this policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to third parties, whether they are suppliers of services on our website (e.g. payment providers) or other websites, different rules will apply to their use or disclosure of your information. Please check their privacy policies carefully.

**9\. How can you access and rectify personal data?**

9.1 You have the right to request personal data that we hold about you, subject to us reserving the right to withhold such data to the extent permitted by law. We may charge an administration fee in line with data protection laws and we may also require appropriate evidence of identity. Note that you may be able to rectify certain of your personal data within your account on our service (if applicable).

9.2 For information about your rights under UK data protection laws, see the website of the [UK Information Commissioner](http://www.ico.org.uk/).
