##### What is TagCommander ?

TagCommander is a Saas Application providing a Universal Tag Container service. It produces a tag container (master tag or meta tag) that concentrates in one tag the work done by several classical tags. As a consequence, it will simplify the management of tags, accelerate the customization and deployment process. It will also accelerate the suppression of tags and increase the reactivity of marketing teams when they want to deactivate a tag. TagCommander helps its customers to take control over the life cycle of tags.

##### How Does TagCommander Collect Data?

We use online techniques such as "cookies" and "pixel tags" to collect data. Cookies are small bits of information that identify a browser. You may be able to set your browser to reject all third-party cookies (including those set by TagCommander) or to alert you when a third-party cookie is sent. For more information, please look at your browser's specific instructions for managing cookies. Pixel tags are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering an image online. An entity that serves a pixel tag can set, read, and modify cookies on, and transfer other data to, the browser that receives the online image. Pixel tags can also obtain information about the computer being used to view that online image. Examples of the types of data we collect through cookies and pixel tags include the following: IP address of the computer, the time it was sent, the user's operating system and browser type, the visitor's browsing and purchasing behavior such as the date and time the visitor visited the website that set the cookie or delivered the pixel tag, the areas of the website visited, the types of products purchased, the information submitted on order forms and website registrations, and other clickstream data, none of which is personally identifiable.
