# Privacy Policy | TagniFi

TagniFi, LLC , its subsidiaries and its affiliates (“TagniFi”) is committed to protecting the privacy and security of its clients. TagniFi’s goal is to provide you with a personalized Internet experience that delivers the information, resources and services that are most relevant and helpful to you. In order to achieve this goal, TagniFi sometimes collects information during your visits to understand what differentiates you from other users of TagniFi.com. TagniFi operates under the following set of strict privacy principles:

  * The only information TagniFi obtains about individual users to its Web site is that supplied voluntarily by users.
  * In cases when TagniFi may need personal information to provide users with customized content or to inform them about new features or services, users are explicitly asked for that information.
  * Personally identifiable information provided by users (name, e-mail or home address, etc.) will not be disclosed to anyone unless users indicate that TagniFi may do so, or unless required by law, in conjunction with a government inquiry, or in litigation or dispute resolution.
  * Only statistical information about TagniFi.com users as a group (usage habits, demographics) may be shared with any affiliate, subsidiary, sponsor, advertiser or partner of TagniFi, unless an appropriate confidentiality agreement is in place. TagniFi employs strict security measures to safeguard online transactions. All personal information is stored in a secured database.



The following discloses TagniFi’s information gathering and dissemination practices for TagniFi.com. Additional terms and conditions, if any, regarding the collection and use of your information may also be provided to you before you sign up for a particular service. Here you will learn what personally identifiable information of yours is collected, how and when TagniFi might use your information, how TagniFi protects your information, who has access to your information, and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.

**What Information is Collected**  
TagniFi collects certain information from its users in three ways: (a) from TagniFi Web server logs, (b) with cookies and (c) directly from the user.

**(a) IP Addresses (Server Log Information)**  
An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. All computer identification on the Internet is conducted with IP addresses, which allow computers and servers to recognize and communicate with each other. TagniFi collects IP addresses in order to conduct system administration, report aggregate information to affiliates, subsidiaries, sponsors, advertisers or partners, and to conduct site analysis. TagniFi will also use IP addresses to identify any users who refuse to comply with TagniFi’s Terms of Use Agreement, and to identify users who threaten TagniFi’s service, site, user, clients or others.

**(b) Cookies**  
TagniFi places a text file called a “cookie” in the browser files of your computer. Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual’s hard disk for record keeping purposes. TagniFi.com uses cookies during your online session to deliver content specific to your interests. Cookies allow TagniFi to avoid showing you the same ad or other message repeatedly. TagniFi Web Site cookies do not contain personal information. They do enable TagniFi to relate your use of the site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided to TagniFi.com.

**(c) Registration (User-Supplied Information)**  
TagniFi.com site registration systems require users to give TagniFi contact information such as their name and e-mail address, and demographic information such as a ZIP code, income level, organization and/or role. The user’s contact information is used to contact the user when necessary. Users may choose (opt-in) to receive future mailings; see the choice/opt-in section below. TagniFi uses this data to tailor the user’s experience at TagniFi.com, showing the user content that reflects their stated preferences. This information may be shared with affiliates, subsidiaries, sponsors, advertisers or partners on an aggregate basis, but personally identifiable information will not be disclosed without the user’s prior consent.
