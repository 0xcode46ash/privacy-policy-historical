# TagCrowd: Privacy

## Your Privacy

TagCrowd is committed to protecting your privacy. We don't have user accounts and don't require registration, so you are free to visit and use our site anonymously.

Please read on for more details about our privacy policy. See also our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/web/20150926194644id_/http%3A//www.tagcrowd.com/tos.html).

### What information do we collect? How do we use it?

When you use TagCrowd.com to create a word cloud, we don't store any information you submit. It exists on our server for the milliseconds it takes to process and generate a word cloud, then is immediately deleted.

The only time we ever collect identifying information is when you purchase a license for commercial use or donate to TagCrowd. This is done through PayPal, which protects the security of your financial information. We only receive your Name and Email Address through this transaction. This allows us to keep track of who has purchased a license and who has donated.

Your information, whether public or private, will not be sold, exchanged, transferred, or given to any other party for any reason whatsoever, without your consent, other than for the express purpose of delivering the service requested.

### How does TagCrowd protect customer information?

We use PayPal's secure server for collecting personal and credit card information. The secure server layer (SSL) encrypts (scrambles) all of the information you enter before it is transmitted over the internet and sent to us. We never receive any financial information because PayPal protects your financial privacy. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. 

### What about "cookies"?
