You should read the Statement and the Terms of Use before you use TagLocal.com. By using TagLocal.com, you agree to be bound by all of the terms, conditions and notices contained or referenced herein. You should review the Statement from time to time. Operator may change the Statement at any time without notice by posting revisions to TagLocal.com. Your continued use of the site constitutes your acceptance of the revised Statement.

#### No Use by Children.

TagLocal.com is not directed to, or intended for use by, children (defined as anyone age twelve (12) or younger). Children should not use TagLocal.com or submit any information to Operator.

#### What Information is Collected.

There are two (2) general types of information that can be collected as a result of your use of TagLocal.com: (1) Personally identifiable information (such as your first and last name, home or other physical address, telephone number, email address, date of birth, social security number, other identifiers that permit physical or online contact with you or any information about you collected online and maintained in personally identifiable form in combination with any of the preceding categories), and (2) aggregate information (such as your IP address - a number used to identify your computer when you are on the Internet - or the type of browser you are using). 

#### Personally Identifiable Information.

Certain features available at TagLocal.com will require you to submit personally identifiable information about yourself ("Personal Information") as a condition of participation. Some of the features may be offered by Operator, while others may be offered by third parties. (For example, you may be required to submit Personal Information in order to enter a contest conducted by Operator, or you may be required to submit Personal Information in order to receive news updates by email from a third party news source.) In addition, Operator may ask you to provide Personal Information for purposes unrelated to the use of a feature at TagLocal.com.

IN ALL CASES, YOU CAN ALWAYS REFUSE TO PROVIDE PERSONAL INFORMATION, BUT THIS MAY RESULT IN DECREASED FUNCTIONALITY OF TAGLOCAL.COM FOR YOU AND LIMIT YOUR ABILITY TO RECEIVE INFORMATION ABOUT PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT MAY BE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST.

In general, the use of Personal Information you choose to submit to a third party in connection with your use of TagLocal.com will be controlled by the privacy practices of the third party and not this Statement.

In general, a cookie is a small amount of data sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. With most browsers or other software, you can erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. You can refer to the instructions for your browser to learn more about these functions. If you choose to reject cookies, TagLocal.com likely will not operate as efficiently for you.
