# Tafford.com - Privacy Policy

**We ensure your privacy as follows:**

**_Information Collection and Use_** __

At  Tafford, we are committed to protecting your privacy and will take every measure to ensure that all information you provide us is held confidential. The information you provide to us is used to process your order, service your account, and to improve our site's content and functionality and enhance your experience, as described below. 

**_Order Information_**

We request information from you as part of the order process, which requires you to provide contact information (such as your name and shipping address) and financial information (such as your credit card number and expiration date). All this information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer orders. If we have trouble processing an order, your contact information is used to get in touch with you. 

**_Personal Information_** __

The information you provide is used to process and bill your orders and contact you when any problems are encountered.  We may also send you information about our company's new services and special offers unless you elect not to receive such offers.  In some cases, we permit third parties to make special offers available to our customers. If you do not wish to take advantage of such offers, you have an opportunity to opt out and keep your personal information from being shared.  If you do not opt out we will only share your contact information such as your name, email address and mailing address, but would never include financial information such as bank account information, credit card number, and expiration date .

**_Cookies_** __

We use cookies in our system for order processing and other tracking capabilities. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Use of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.  Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. However, we have no access to, or control over, these cookies. 

**_Log Files_** __

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to any personally identifiable information. 

**_Data Sharing_** __

We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers.  We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. When a customer enters an order on our website, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide the services mentioned above. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

Although we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order, or a legal process served on our website. 

**_Links_** __

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Tafford is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website. 

**_Security_** __

This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. When you place an order with us, you are using our secure e-commerce server and secure server software (SSL). This means that all of the information you enter is encrypted before we receive it. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information offline. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, our employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.

Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment. 

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an e-mail to customerservice@tafford.com. 

**_Administrative Type Emails_** __

From time to time, we send users administrative-type email communications. You are not able to un-subscribe from administrative type emails, which contain important information about our products and services. We use administrative emails to communicate with users to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account. 

**_Correction/Updating Personal Information_ : **

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your address), or if a user no longer desires our services, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can be done by clicking the "Your Account" link on any page on the website and making the desired changes, or by visiting our Customer Service Center. 

**_Notification of Changes_** __

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will prominently post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and the circumstances, if any, under which we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
