# Privacy Policy - TaDa.com | About Us

I. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT? 

We collect two kinds of information related to you: (a) Personally Identifiable Information ("PII"); and (b) Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("Non-PII"). 

(a) Personally Identifiable Information: PII includes any information that identifies you as person. We collect your PII when you choose to register with us or when you choose to participate in an interactive feature of our Site such as a review, survey or promotion. You may: (a) provide your name, mail/shipping address, email address, credit card number and phone number when registering with our Site, making a purchase, or in connection with a contest entry; (b) provide certain demographic information about you (e.g., age, gender, shopping interests and preferences, etc.) when participating in a survey or poll; or (c) post a general comment and/or recommendation on our Site. 

(b) Non-Personally Identifiable Information: Non-PII is any information that does not identify you as a person including PII which has been rendered anonymous. We obtain non-PII either separately or together with your PII as described above. We collect certain non-PII from you when you access our Site including IP addresses and information relating to your browser, operating system, ISP, the third party website from which your visit originated and how you use our Site such as the web pages you visit, and the duration of your visits. 

II. HOW WE USE & SHARE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED 

PII and Non-PII is used to provide, or improve, our Site and Services to you and to carry out your requests, respond to your inquiries, better serve you and understand your needs, or is used in other ways naturally associated with the circumstances in which you provided the information. 

We may disclose PII and Non-PII to: 

(1) any merchant you buy Products from using our Site; 

(2) our third party service providers who perform functions on our behalf in connection with the operation of the Site or Services - e.g., providers who host and manage data, process credit card orders, deliver our merchandise, etc; 

(3) participating sponsors to a program or promotion you enter through our Site or Services; 

(4) our parent company, subsidiaries or other affiliated companies ("affiliated companies") for operational, marketing and promotional purposes; 

(5) co-promotional partners and others with whom we have marketing or other relationships;

(7) our other users where you choose to publicly post reviews, comments or other information relating to products or services, communicate with other users via public forums (e.g., forums, message boards, bulletin boards, etc.). 

In addition, we use non-PII to help analyze site traffic, understand customer needs and trends, carry out targeted promotional activities (see "Preference Based Advertising" below). We may use your non-PII by itself or aggregate it with information we have obtained from others to produce research reports and other information and data about online shopping for participating merchants and other customers, as well as media and other interested parties. 

III. COOKIES AND PREFERENCE BASED ADVERTISING 

(a) Cookies and Web Beacons: We automatically receive and store certain types of non-PII whenever you interact with us by using "cookies" and analogous technology. "Cookies" are small files that we place on your computer or your Web browser memory to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide convenience and other features to you. It is important to note that the cookies that we use do not contain and are not tied to PII about you. 

You may be able to direct your internet browser not to allow cookies and you can delete existing cookies from your computer. Please note, however, some elements of our Site will not function properly or be available to you. 

(b) Preference Based Advertising: We work with third parties, including advertising companies and website analysis firms, who use cookies to collect non-PII when you visit our Site and third party sites about your surfing activities. This non-PII, collected through cookies, is typically used by these third party advertising networks to serve you with advertisements while on third party sites tailored to meet your preferences and likely interests. If you do not wish to participate in this activity, please [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) and follow the simple opt-out process. 

A couple of important notes about this opt-out tool: (1) it includes all the advertising networks that TaDa works with, but also many that TaDa does not work with; and (2) it relies on cookies to ensure that a given advertising network does not collect information about you ("Opt-out Cookies") . for a general explanation of how Opt-out Cookies work, please [click here](http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/opting_out.aspx) .

IV. SALE OF BUSINESS AND DISCLOSURE BY LAW 

(a) Business Transactions: We may disclose PII and Non-PII held by us: (a) to a prospective seller or actual seller of any business or assets we acquire; (b) if all or any of our assets are acquired by a third party, in which case, PII and Non-PII may be one of the transferred assets. 

(b) Required disclosures: We may disclose and use any PII or non-PII if we are required to do so by law, with respect to copyright and other intellectual property infringement claims, or if we believe that such action is necessary to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform with the requirements of the law or legal process; (c) protect or defend our legal rights or property, our Site, or other users; or (d) in an emergency to protect the health and safety of our Site's users or the general public.
