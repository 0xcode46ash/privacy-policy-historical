# Tadpoles, Connecting Parents with Childcare, Preschool and Daycare Providers

**Personal Information**  
We consider all information captured using Tadpoles Pro to be a private communication between Providers and Parents. No personal information is shared with any external parties unless a Provider has explicitly invited a Parent to establish communications. All invitations are handled via the Parent's email address and a valid Google account is required for the Parent to authenticate and view the information. No personally identifiable information is sent via emails and instead Parents are required to login to the Tadpoles web application or mobile application to view updates about their children to ensure only authorized viewers have access to information.
