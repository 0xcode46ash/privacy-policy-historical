Personal Information Maintenance & Opt-Out

If you wish to opt-out of our use and/or disclosure of your personal information, other than as expressly covered in this Privacy Policy and/or to process any purchase orders, you will generally have the option to do so when you first submit your personal information via the TMaG Websites. Simply indicate your desire to opt-out by checking or un-checking the appropriate box. If you wish to amend or delete any personal information you have previously provided without opt-out, please send us a message at [consumer.feedback@tmag.com](mailto:consumer.feedback@tmag.com).

How Do We Use Personal Information?

TMaG will never disclose your email address to third parties for use in connection with any email marketing campaign of a third party or business partner (excluding TMaG subsidiary companies).

TMaG may always use personal information in the following ways:

  * to enable us to respond to you generally, or to process, validate and verify requests and/or purchase orders
  * to perform any services requested by you
  * to compile and/or distribute aggregate - never individual \- information about our website users and aggregate usage patterns
  * to provide our own website designers with useful information for developing new features and services that meet your needs
  * to tailor your experience on our websites, showing you content we think might interest you or altering the content according to your personal preferences
  * as part of an online employment application to evaluate your qualifications only



TMaG will not disclose your email address for use in connection with a third party's marketing efforts.

If you have not "opted-out" of our use and disclosure of your personal information, TMaG may also use personal information for all marketing and survey purposes on behalf of itself and its affiliates and subsidiaries. TMaG may appoint third party agents in connection with such marketing and survey efforts. TMaG may disclose personal information to select business partners for use in connection with direct mail marketing efforts, but that personal information will not include your email address.  
If you have "opted-out", TMaG will use or disclose your personal information only as stated above, or: (1) when legally ordered to do so by a lawful subpoena or court order, (2) if you violate or breach an agreement with TMaG, (3) if we believe you will harm the property or rights of TMaG or those of TMaG's other customers, (4) under exigent circumstances to protect the physical safety of TMaG, its employees, users or the general public, or (5) to validate credit card numbers for charging for fee services.

Aggregate Information

TMaG may share aggregate statistical information with business partners, sponsors or other third parties, but none of them receive individual identifying information about you. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of visitors visited a certain area on a website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out registration forms, but we would not disclose anything that uniquely identifies those individuals.

Unsolicited Emails Received by You

TMaG does not send unsolicited bulk emails to anyone who has requested that we do not contact them. We send our newsletters only to those who have taken affirmative steps to subscribe. If you have inadvertently received one of our newsletters, or if you simply wish to stop receiving them, please follow the "unsubscribe" instructions contained in each newsletter or send a request to be unsubscribed to [consumer.feedback@tmag.com](mailto:consumer.feedback@tmag.com).

Chat Rooms and Forums

The TMaG Websites may now or in the future include chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. You should exercise caution before disclosing your personal information via these public venues, which you do at your own risk. If you do so, you may receive unsolicited emails or "spam" from others. TMaG cannot safeguard the privacy of personal information that is disclosed online in this manner. 

Our Cookies

Your browser software includes a feature called "cookies." If enabled, cookies may store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of the TMaG Websites. However, cookies tell us nothing about you personally unless you specifically give us additional information. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features you like best and what content you may have viewed during past visits. When you re-visit the TMaG Websites, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. We may use cookies to:

  * keep count of return visits to the TMaG Websites
  * accumulate and report anonymous, aggregate, statistical information   
on website usage
  * deliver content specific to your interests or past viewing history
  * save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our websites.



You can also disable cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you can accept or reject all cookies, or request a notification when a cookie is set. 

IP Addresses

TMaG does not store or record the Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses of visitors to the Website for marketing purposes, although we may store IP addresses in server logs for system maintenance purposes or to store the source location whenever someone provides Personal Information. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. An Internet Service Providers ("ISP") typically assigns a random IP addresses at the time of your dial-up. For local area network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular computer. We cannot determine your identity solely based upon your IP address. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages, but these IP addresses are never associated with Internet users.

Web Beacons

The TMaG Websites contain electronic images (called "pixels", "transparent GIF files", or "web beacons") that allow us and our advertising partners to view and access cookies. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. Web beacons are small in order not to use valuable space on the computer screen that is better used to display helpful content. In some cases these files are provided by our online management partner. These files enable our online management partner to recognize a unique cookie on your web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by us or by another advertiser that works with our online management partner. We may also include web beacons in HTML-formatted newsletters containing graphics that we send to opt-in subscribers, so we may count the number of newsletters that have been opened and read. We may also use the web beacon and cookies to monitor your online behavior and interests on the TMaG Websites. With both cookies and web beacons, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.

Computer Profiles

TMaG may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data that helps us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors. For example, we may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. If you do not register on one of the TMaG Websites, none of this information is personally identifiable.

Security

The TMaG Websites use physical, electronic and managerial security measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control.

  * We use Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") connections with 128-bit encryption for certain transactions and confidential data. When you use a secure browser, all information you submit comes to us over the Internet in an encrypted form. Every secure page uses a digital certificate issued by a third-party certification authority. A "site certificate" sits on all secure pages. To view this certificate, click on the image of the closed lock or the solid key on the bottom bar of your browser window.
  * We monitor system and application activity logs to identify any unusual activity from authorized and/or unauthorized individuals accessing our systems and/or making changes to stored information. We regularly perform preventative system maintenance and monitoring to ensure the security of our data systems.
  * We maintain our servers in locked facilities with secure access. Backup tapes are retrieved daily and stored by an independent company in a secure, off-site location.



The TMaG Websites do not require you to set up a user ID and password unless you subscribe for some of our special services, create a purchasing account with us, or are an InerCircle member seeking access to your account information. We recommend you do not divulge your password to anyone. TMaG will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited telephone call or email.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. You can report network abuse and any risk of security violations to us by emailing [abuse@tmag.com](mailto:abuse@tmag.com).

Children's Online Privacy Protection

The TMaG Websites comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, which protects the privacy of children using the Internet. TMaG does not knowingly collect contact or personal information from children under 13\. The TMaG Websites are not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under 13, and are designed to block our knowing acceptance of any such information. It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information pertaining to children under 13. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will immediately obtain parental consent or otherwise delete the information from our servers. If you want to notify us of our receipt of information by children under 13, please do so by emailing us at [consumer.feedback@tmag.com](mailto:consumer.feedback@tmag.com).
