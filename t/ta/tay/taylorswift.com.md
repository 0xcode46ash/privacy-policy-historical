This Policy is part of the Terms and Conditions governing your use of the Website and the Services.  Please read the [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20110514164755id_/http%3A//www.taylorswift.com/terms) ** **.   If you do not agree with any part of this Policy, please do not use the Sites or the Services.

For this reason, please visit this page on a regular basis to ensure that you are familiar with the most recent version of this Policy. You can address your questions or concerns regarding this Policy to [privacy@TaylorSwift.com](mailto:privacy@TaylorSwift.com). 

This Policy is effective as of the date set forth above and is only applicable to the Sites and not to any other website that you may be able to access from any of the Sites which may have its own data collection and use practices and policies.

This Policy answers the following questions:

  * What is our policy on children’s privacy?

  * Will we share your personally-identifiable information with third parties?
  * What choices do you have about the collection and use of your personally-identifiable information?

**_What is our policy on children’s privacy?_** _ _

We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the activities offered on the Sites. 

The Sites are not for children under 13 years of age.  However, there are some areas of the Sites that may be attractive to children under 13.  We do not condition participation by a child of any age in any activity or any of the services available on or through the Sites on the disclosure of more personally-identifiable information than is reasonable necessary to participate in an activity.  We do not knowingly collect personally-identifiable information from users of the Sites who are under 13 years of age.  No personally-identifiable information should be submitted to, or posted at, the Sites by visitors under 13 years of age without the prior written consent of their parent or guardian.

If we receive an e-mail message from a child who discloses, or is otherwise known to us, to be under 13 years of age, we may, without the consent of the child’s parent or guardian:

  * Respond to a one-time request from the child;
  * Provide notice of the child’s communication to the child’s parent or guardian; 
  * Use this information as may be necessary to ensure the safety of the child on the Sites; or
  * Send our electronic periodical publications and materials, with the notification to the child’s parent or guardian and the opportunity to discontinue any future delivery of the above information.



Any parent or guardian of a child under 13 years of age who has provided personally-identifiable information to us may request a description of the personally-identifiable information that has been collected from or about that child, and either limit or restrict any further maintenance or use of such information from that child and/or direct us to delete it.  Also, a parent may decline to allow any future collection of personally-identifiable information from that child.  Such requests can be made by contacting us at privacy@TaylorSwift.com.  We will take reasonable measures to verify that the requesting party is, in fact, the parent or guardian of the child in question before providing a child’s personally-identifiable information to such person. 

A parent may also access the personally-identifiable information that has been collected by us through accessing the “My Account” area of that parent’s child’s account by logging into the Sites with that child’s account name and password.

We will not knowingly use or disclose any personally-identifiable information of a child under 13 years of age for any purpose except as described above.    

**_What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?_**

**The Type of Information We Collect and How We Collect It**

By accessing or using the Sites, you may provide us with two types of information: (1) personally-identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to disclose to us, such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and credit card information; and (2) non-personally-identifiable information, which we collect through the use of the technology called “cookies,” “web beacons” and/or “web logs.”  You do not need to submit personally-identifiable information to access certain areas of the Sites, but if you do not want to disclose certain personally-identifiable information to us, you will not be able to access certain aspects of the Services.

We collect personally-identifiable information when you create an account through the Services; subscribe to our newsletter; participate in chat rooms, forums, polls, surveys, and questionnaires; participate in contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions; purchase a product through the Services; register a product that you have purchased; contact us through the “Contact Us” links on the Sites, or receive customer or technical support. 

To create an account for the Services, we require you to provide your name, date of birth, e-mail address, and phone number.  You will also need to create a screen name and password.  When you are purchasing products through the Services, in addition to your name, e-mail address and screen name that you choose, we will ask for your shipping and billing address and credit card, debit card or other payment information. 

Additionally, we may also collect other types of information (known as demographic information) such as your gender, hobbies and interests. This demographic information may be associated with your personally-identifiable information.

**How We Use Your Personally-Identifiable Information**

The personally-identifiable information you provide to us will allow us to fulfill your product or service order; alert you of new products or services, features, or enhancements; handle/route your customer service questions or issues; and/or notify you of contests, promotions, or special events and offers.  We may contact you by e-mail with respect to your order of our products or services or your account.  We also use your e-mail address to send you messages about the Services and other general announcements. 

We keep track of your interactions with us, including, but not limited to, your activity within the Services.  We may use information relating to your interactions with us to generate information about the popularity of certain Services and how users of the Sites utilize different aspects of the Services (“ ** _Popularity Data_** ”).  We may use this Popularity Data to design, develop and implement additional services and features of the Sites and to improve the Services.  Popularity Data may be associated with your account and we may provide a point system in which your account earns points through the amount of Popularity Data your account has achieved.  These points may be displayed with the account information that is publicly displayed to other end users of the Sites, such as when you participate in a forum in the Sites, but we do not disclose the Popularity Data itself as associated with your account. 

We may use personally-identifiable information that you provide to us to send messages to you in response to your request to perform an activity in connection with your use of any of the Services. 

**How We Use Your Non-Personally-Identifiable Information**

  * Service Providers.  We may share your personally-identifiable information with service providers that we engage for the purpose of processing information on our and your behalf.  For example, we have partnered with other companies to sell products through the Services, fulfill product orders and process payments.  Additionally, we may partner with other companies to process consumer surveys, fulfill prizes, or to process, analyze, and/or store data.  While providing services for us, these companies may access your personally-identifiable information.  To the extent applicable, we require these entities to comply with this Policy and appropriate confidentiality and security measures.  ** **



**Additional Information You Should Know About Third Parties**

This Policy does not cover the information practices of third party websites linked to any of the Sites. Although we encourage such third parties to adopt and follow their own privacy policies, we are not responsible for their collection and use of your personally-identifiable information.  You should refer to the privacy policies and statements of other websites or contact the respective webmasters of those websites to obtain information regarding their information collection, use and disclosure policies. 

When you click on an advertisement or third party logo displayed on the Sites that links you to a different website, this Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser or third party to see how your personally-identifiable information will be handled on their website.

The Services may also have message boards, forums and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.  When you post to a message board, forum or chat area, please be aware that the information you post is made publicly available on-line and you do so at your own risk.

**Dispute Resolution for Residents of the European Union**

If you are a resident of the European Union, in the event that you have any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Policy, you may report your claim to the European Union Data Protection Authorities located in your jurisdiction.

The personally-identifiable information that you provide to us is stored on servers, which are located in secured facilities with restricted access, and protected by protocols and procedures designed to ensure the security of such information.  In addition, we restrict access to personally-identifiable information to our employees, independent contractors and agents who need to know this information in order to develop, operate and maintain the Sites and Services.  All personnel who have access to this information are trained in the maintenance and security of such information.  However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure, and, for this reason, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us.
