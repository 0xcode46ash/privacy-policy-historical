1\. SECURITY ASSURANCE  
TackleDirect guarantee's that your credit card information is safe with us! In an effort to further protect the consumer against fraudulent charges, TackleDirect offers our customers total security assurance.

Here's how we protect you:

1) First, our site uses the latest in encryption technology, digital certificates, secure commerce servers and authentication to ensure that your personal information is secure online. TackleDirect uses digital certificates from Verisign, Inc., a trusted third-party Certification Authority (CA). Also known as Digital IDs, these digital certificates are similar to your driver's license, passport or membership card in that they prove your identity. Digital IDs are useful in electronic commerce because they verify the identity of the parties involved. Making a credit card purchase at TackleDirect is actually more secure than using your credit card at the local store or restaurant. 

2) TackleDirect uses 128 bit encryption for maximum security for communications over the Internet. Furthermore, TackleDirect ensures the privacy of the information not only online, but through our back-end systems. 

According to CNN, "The prevalent opinion...is that on-line credit card use is actually no riskier for consumers than traditional "low-tech" transactions." We order products online all the time, both as a company and as individuals. When we use a credit card to buy something online, we feel at least as safe as we would using one in a store or restaurant.
