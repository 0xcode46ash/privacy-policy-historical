## What is the Shimano Technical Center?

When Shimano came to us looking for a tackle shop to represent their products in the United States, we couldn’t have been more proud. We are now home to a fully stocked, full-time Shimano Technical Center.

Along with showcasing the complete product line of reels, rods, lures and storage systems that Shimano has to offer, the Shimano Technical Center at TackleDirect is a “store within a store” for all Shimano brands. This includes a G. Loomis Performance Center for rods, a PowerPro products center, a full cross section of Jackall Baits, and an apparel selection from all of the brands Shimano has to offer.

You could literally travel hundreds of miles in any direction and not find a selection as comprehensive as what TackleDirect has to offer at the Shimano Technical Center.

This regionally unique concept not only maintains the widest selection available, but the ProStaff at TackleDirect has also undergone extensive training in all of the products. In face, Shimano regularly sends its overseas employees to our Technical Center to train in merchandising and marketing.

If you reside or travel anywhere throughout the Mid-Atlantic or Northeastern United States, a visit to the Shimano Technical Center at TackleDirect is a must-do on your list. For expert product knowledge, award winning service, and the ONLY Shimano Technical Center on the East Coast, come to TackleDirect, the World's Premiere Fishing Outfitter.

## What is your privacy policy?

TackleDirect is committed to respecting your privacy and recognizing your need for appropriate protection and management of personal information you share with us (the phrase "personal information" means any information by which you can be identified, such as your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, etc.). The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform you what personal information we may collect from you, how we use such information, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to review and correct, the information. This policy applies only to customers in the United States.

As a part of our commitment to your privacy, TackleDirect supports and adheres to the guidelines and practices adopted by the Direct Marketing Association's "Privacy Promise to American Consumers." We have agreed to (1) provide customers with notice of their ability to opt out of information rental, sale or exchange with other marketers; (2) honor customers' requests not to share their information with other marketers; and (3) honor customers' requests not to receive mail, telephone or other solicitations from TackleDirect.

### Collecting Information About You

There may be times (such as when you purchase or order a product, subscribe to a service, register to receive catalogs, or to participate in contests, sweepstakes or promotions, etc.) when we ask you to provide certain information about yourself, such as your name, shipping/billing address, telephone number, email address, credit card information, birth date, gender, occupation, personal interests, etc. We may also maintain a record of your product purchases.

Whether or not to provide such information is completely your own choice. But if you choose not to provide the information we request, you may be unable to purchase products, or access certain services, offers and content on our web site. In addition, we may need to contact you via phone, email or mail to address questions or issues specific to your order, entry, etc., even if you have opted to not receive communications from us.

In general, you can visit many of our web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We may track the Internet domain address from which people visit us and analyze this data for trends and statistics, but individual users will remain anonymous, unless you voluntarily tell us who you are.

### Using Information About You

We use the personal information you provide for internal purposes, such as confirming and tracking your order, subscription or registration, analyzing trends and statistics, informing you of our new products, services and offers, and providing you with information from and about TackleDirect. From time to time we might establish a business relationship with other persons or entities whom we believe trustworthy and whom we have asked to confirm that their privacy policies are consistent with ours. These are known as our TackleDirect Partners. In such cases we might share and cross-reference information, including personal information about you that will enable such persons or entities to contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest to you.

To serve you better, we may combine information you give us online, in our stores or through our catalogs. We may also combine that information with publicly available information and information we receive from or cross-reference with our TackleDirect Partners and others. We use that combined information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us, to communicate with you about our products and events that may be of interest to you, and for other promotional purposes.

We may contract with companies or persons to provide certain services including credit card processing, shipping, data management, promotional services, etc. We call them our Service Providers. We provide our Service Providers with the information needed for them to perform these services. We also ask our Service Providers to confirm that their privacy practices are consistent with ours.

Although unlikely, in certain instances we may disclose your personal information when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities who may be causing injury to you, to TackleDirect or to others. We may also disclose your personal information when we believe the law requires it.

Editing, Updating, Correcting and Deleting Information About You We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us.

You can generally set your browser to not accept cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it.

We may contract with third parties who may use cookies and collect information on our behalf. These third parties are prohibited by our contract with them from sharing that information with anyone other than us or our Service Providers. However, we respect your right to choose whether to be included in such services. If you would like to opt out of these services, please contact us.

## What is your security policy?

Every angler knows the importance of safety in the water. We take a similarly rigorous approach with your security. We guarantee that your credit card information is safe. In an effort to protect you against fraudulent charges, we offer all our customers the following total security assurance:

  * TackleDirect.com uses the latest in encryption technology, digital certificates, secure commerce servers, and authentication to ensure that your personal information is secure online. TackleDirect.com uses digital certificates from Verisign, Inc., a trusted, third-party Certification Authority (CA). Also know as Digital IDs, these digital certificates are similar to your driver’s license, passport, or membership card—they prove your identity. Digital IDs are useful in electronic commerce because they verify the identity of the parties involved. Making a purchase at TackleDirect.com is actually more secure that using your credit card at a local store or restaurant.
  * We use 128 bit encryption for maximum security. We ensure the privacy of your information online, and within our back-end systems.



We promise to take every precaution to protect the security of your personal information. Unfortunately, no data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our web sites, and you do so at your own risk.

We urge you to keep your password in a safe place and not to divulge it to anyone. Also, please remember to log off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit. This will ensure that others cannot easily access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone or using a computer in a public place.

## Do you have an opt-out policy?

Of course! You have the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us at any point. If you want to be removed from our database and no longer receive communications, please email us at [sales@tackledirect.com](mailto:sales@tackledirect.com).
