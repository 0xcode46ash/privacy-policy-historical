## Privacy Policy

**Harris Publications believes that you should control the dissemination of the personally identifiable information that you provide when using the Tactical Life web site (“the Site”). Please review this policy carefully to understand how we will treat the personally identifiable information that you give to us and other information in connection with the Site. This policy applies only to the Site.**

Your use of this Site in any fashion constitutes your agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms). Please review this page periodically. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it. Your continued use of the Site constitutes your agreement to any such changes.

### What personally identifiable information is collected on this Site?

You do not have to provide any personally identifiable information to use the Site. However, when you use the Site to obtain our products and services, to enter contests, to post messages on the Site, or for other reasons, you may choose to provide Harris Publications with certain personally identifiable information as indicated in each such area of the Site, such as your name, physical address, email address, zip code, phone number, and gender. Harris Publications will make an effort to include a link to the Privacy Policy whenever we ask you for personally identifiable information.

### How is my personally identifiable information used by Harris Publications?

We use the personally identifiable information to provide you with the services you have requested and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. We may use the personally identifiable information to send you advertising from selected Harris Publications partners and advertisers (unless you have opted out of receiving these types of communications).

We may also aggregate the information we collect to develop certain summary reports for our partners and/or advertisers. We provide this information to assist our partners and/or advertisers in determining how to promote their products and services. In so doing, we do not reveal personally identifiable information.

### Who has access to my personally identifiable information?

Harris Publications makes reasonable efforts to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we do not share your personally identifiable information with any third parties other than our contractors who assist us in providing our services. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure. While we takes steps to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or from the Site, and you use the Site at your own risk.

### What personally identifiable information is disclosed to third parties?

Harris Publications may share the following personally identifiable information with its advertisers, sponsors, and partners in the following circumstances:

  * Information you provide when entering into a contest, sweepstakes or promotion sponsored by the Site and/or one of our advertisers/partners/sponsors.
  * Information you provide when you register to receive goods or services from Harris Publications or from one of our advertisers/partners/sponsors.



Unless you have opted out of receiving special offers or emails from selected third parties, we may provide a report to an advertiser or partner which tells them who responded to a particular offer. For example, we might send you an email which offers you a discount on a particular product. If you click on that e-mail or accept an offer or discount contained therein, we may provide the advertiser with the personally identifiable information necessary to provide you with that discount.

Harris Publications may disclose your personally identifiable information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process. Harris Publications may also disclose information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Use, or to protect the safety of our users or the public. Harris Publications may transfer your personally identifiable information in connection with the sale or merger, in whole or in part, of Harris Publications its assets or the division responsible for the services being provided to you.

You should be aware that personally identifiable information which you voluntarily include and transmit online in a posting may be viewed and used by others. We are unable to control such uses of your personally identifiable information, and by using such services you assume the risk that the personally identifiable information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties.

### How do I opt out of the collection, disclosure and distribution of personally identifiable information?

You can always choose whether or not to disclose personally identifiable information and that choice will not prevent you from using the Site. Please note, however, that you must provide some personally identifiable information in order to use certain services on the Site. In addition, you can always choose to opt-out of certain uses of your personally identifiable information at any time.

If you do not want your personally identifiable information shared with third parties for their marketing purposes, then please email us at [privacy@tactical-life.com](mailto:privacy@tactical-life.com)

If you do not want us to use your personally identifiable information for our own marketing purpose in connection with the Site, then please email us at [privacy@tactical-life.com](mailto:privacy@tactical-life.com)

However, we are not responsible for removing your personally identifiable information from the lists of any third party who has previously been provided your information in accordance with this policy.

### What happens when I go to linked sites?

When you are on our Site, you may be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. For example, if you “click” on a sponsor’s logo, the “click” may take you off the Site. These other sites may independently collect data, solicit personally identifiable information, or send their own cookies to you. You should review the privacy practices of every web site you visit.

### What is Harris Publications’ policy regarding children’s privacy?

This Site is neither directed to nor intended for children under 13. Harris Publications will not knowingly collect and use personally identifiable information from children under age 13 without receiving verifiable consent from such individual’s parent or guardian. When we become aware that personally identifiable information from a child under 13 has been collected without such child’s parent or guardian’s consent, we will use all reasonable efforts to delete such personally identifiable information from our database. For more information on protecting your privacy, please visit [www.ftc.gov/privacy](http://www.ftc.gov/privacy).

### How are cookies used by Harris Publications?

Harris Publications assigns a random number to each user for anonymously tracking traffic patterns. This random number is kept in a file on your computer called a “cookie.” Cookies allow Harris Publications to keep track of how often users are visiting specific areas of our Site – or simply how many times a user visits our Site each month. Third parties, such as our advertisers, may use cookies of their own in connection with this Site.

Harris Publications does not require users to accept cookies in order to enjoy the Site. You can set your browser to reject cookies, or to notify you when Harris Publications or any other company sends you a cookie. If you have questions about how to change your browser’s “cookie” settings, you should contact the software manufacturer. You should be aware, however, that many areas of Harris Publications will be significantly slower, or may not function at all, if cookies are disabled.

Anonymous and non-personally identifiable information collected via cookies and through other methods on this Site may be used by Harris Publications or any purpose and shared with any number of third parties, as long as such information does not include any personally identifiable information.
