# Policies

## Privacy Policy

Please read this document carefully. It is Tableau Software's ("Tableau's") privacy policy. This policy covers how Tableau treats personal information that Tableau collects and receives, including information related to your past use of Tableau products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable, like your name, address, employer, email address, or phone number, that is not otherwise publicly available. 

This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Tableau does not own or control, or to people that Tableau does not employ or manage.

## Information Collection and Use

Tableau collects personal information when you register with Tableau [(examples)](https://web.archive.org/useexamples), or when you use Tableau products or services. Tableau receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Tableau cookie information, and the pages you request. Tableau uses this information for the following general purposes: to fulfill your requests for products and services, to improve our products and services, to contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the Tableau service, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the Tableau Newsletter, that are considered part of your Tableau account, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them. 

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

Tableau does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies, except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: we provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Tableau under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Tableau communicate with you about offers from Tableau and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.

## Confidentiality and Security 

We limit access of your personal information to only those who we reasonably believe need this information in order to provide products or services to you.

## Online Forums

You agree, through your use of any and all online forums (e.g., the Tableau Support Center) made available on Tableau’s websites, that you will not post any material which is false, defamatory, inaccurate, abusive, vulgar, hateful, harassing, obscene, profane, sexually oriented, threatening, invasive of a person's privacy, adult material, or otherwise in violation of any International or United States Federal law. You also agree not to post any copyrighted material unless you own the copyright or you have written consent from the owner of the copyrighted material. Spam, flooding, advertisements, chain letters, pyramid schemes, and solicitations are also forbidden on this forum. 

You have the ability, as you register, to choose your username. We advise that you keep the name appropriate. With this user account you are about to register, you agree to never give your password out to another person except an administrator, for your protection and for validity reasons. You also agree to NEVER use another person's account for any reason. We also HIGHLY recommend you use a complex and unique password for your account, to prevent account theft. 

Note that it is impossible for Tableau to confirm the validity of posts. Please remember that Tableau does not actively monitor the posted messages, and as such, are not responsible for the content contained within. Tableau does not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any information presented. The posted messages express the views of the author, and not necessarily the views of Tableau. Anyone who feels that a posted message is objectionable is encouraged to notify an administrator or moderator of this forum immediately. Tableau reserves the right to remove objectionable content, within a reasonable time frame, if they determine that removal is necessary. This is a manual process, however, please realize that they may not be able to remove or edit particular messages immediately. You remain solely responsible for the content of your posted messages. Furthermore, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless Tableau. Tableau also reserves the right to reveal your identity (or any other related information collected on this service) in the event of a formal complaint or legal action arising from any situation caused by your use of this forum. 

Any information Tableau determines to be inaccurate, unhelpful or inappropriate for any reason will be removed, with or without prior notice. Appropriate sanctions may be applicable. This policy applies to member profile information as well. 

Please note that with each post, your IP address is recorded, in the event that you need to be banned from this forum or your ISP contacted. This will only happen in the event of a major violation of this agreement. 

Also note that Tableau’s online forums place a cookie, a text file containing bits of information (such as your username and password), in your browser's cache. The collection and usage of this information is governed by Tableau’s Privacy Policy.
