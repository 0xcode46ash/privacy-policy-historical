# Tabblo - Privacy Policy

At Tabblo, we’re serious about protecting your privacy. The following privacy policy details how we will and will not use your personal information. 

What Information We Collect

  * To create an account and start making Tabblos, you need to submit a valid email address and create a password. We will use your email address to communicate with you about your account. We will also use it to communicate with you about the Tabblo service in general, unless you choose to opt out of these mailings. You can do this by changing your preferences on your profile page and/or hitting the “unsubscribe�? link at the bottom of any Tabblo emails. Additional use of this address is limited to the uses listed below in "Information Sharing and Disclosure."
  * Email invitations to view Tabblos are controlled by individual Tabblo members and are not subject to Tabblo corporate control.
  * If you order print products, we will need your full name and address in order to ship them to you. We also require a valid credit card number for payment.
  * Any contact with our customer service team may be recorded to help us provide better service.
  * Information posted by individuals on the Tabblo blog or Tabblo forums is public and visible to anyone visiting those pages.
  * Tabblo uses cookies to make it easy for you to navigate the site and so we can improve your experience when using the site. Cookies are small files stored on your computer’s hard drive by your web browser. We never save personal information such as passwords or credit card numbers in the cookies. If you set your browser preference so that it will reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Tabblo.
  * Our third-party service providers also use cookies to gather anonymous information such as IP address and browser information. We track that information so that we can understand how Tabblo is being used and ultimately how we can improve the user experience.



Information Sharing and Disclosure

  * Tabblo will never rent, sell, or share your email, physical address or other personal information to a third party, except in the following circumstances: 
    * We may share your email and/or physical address with our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted third-party partners for the purpose of providing and operating the Tabblo service (e.g., communicating with you regarding shipment of items ordered on Tabblo). We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
    * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;
    * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Tabblo's Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.
    * If Tabblo becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
  * We will send you regular email updates (such as information about new features) and occasional promotional offers (such as information about Tabblo-sponsored contests) that may be of interest to you. You may opt-out of these mailings at any time by hitting the "unsubscribe" link in the bottom of the email or by changing your email preferences on your profile page.
  * You may use Tabblo to invite others to view your photos. We will use the email addresses you provide only to send an invitation to view your photos. Tabblo will not sell or share the recipients’ email addresses, or add them to any mailing lists.
  * You control who sees your photos on Tabblo. Be aware that if you choose to make your photos public on the Tabblo site, they can be viewed by anyone using the site. Please also be aware that if you post a link to your Tabblo pictures on your own website or the websites of others, or share your pictures with friends or family members who post your share invitation on a website or forward it to other individuals, these pictures may be accessible to additional people who view the email or visit these websites.
