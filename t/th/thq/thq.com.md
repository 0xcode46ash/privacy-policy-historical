# THQ | United States | Privacy Policy

**THQ Inc.  
Online Privacy Policy**

[](https://www.esrb.org/confirm/thq-confirmation.htm) THQ Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates (hereinafter collectively referred to as "THQ" and/or "we") respect the privacy of our online visitors and recognize the importance of protecting your personal information. THQ has therefore adopted a corporate wide Online Privacy Policy that guides how it collects, stores and uses the information you provide us when you visit our web site.

This Privacy Statement and the certification seal located to your right confirms that THQ is a valid licensee and participating member in the Entertainment Software Rating Board's Privacy Online Program: ESRB Privacy Online. To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this initiative and had all of our web sites reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Online to meet established online information collection and use practices. As part of this privacy program, we are subject to frequent audits of our sites and other enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by ESRB Privacy Online.

ESRB Privacy Online is a third-party seal provider whose mission is to protect consumers' online privacy and make the Internet a secure, reliable, and private place to share information and conduct business. ESRB Privacy Online promotes and enforces established principles and guidelines for fair information practices that include requirements of full disclosure, notice, and informed consent.

Whenever you visit a web site that displays the ESRB Privacy Online certification seal, you can expect to be notified of: 

  * Exactly what personal and demographic information may be collected and by what means;
  * Who, if anyone, is collecting your personal information; 
  * How this information may be used, including, with whom, if anyone, it might be shared; 
  * The consequences, if any, resulting from your refusal to provide personal information; 
  * How you can access and, if necessary, change the personal information a company collects and maintains; 
  * How a company ensures data security, quality, and integrity; 
  * Whether information is collected from children under 13; and, 
  * Where and how to ask questions or file complaints. 



If you have any questions, complaints, or comments regarding our privacy statement or policies, please contact THQ's Privacy Policy Administrator by sending an e-mail to privacypolicy@thq.com, a facsimile to (818) 871-7400, or by writing to: Privacy Policy Administrator, c/o THQ Inc., 27001 Agoura Road, Suite 325, Calabasas Hills, CA 91301. You can also contact ESRB Privacy Online directly at (212) 759-0700 or by regular mail at 845 Third Avenue, 14th Floor, New York, NY 10022.

**WHAT AND HOW INFORMATION IS COLLECTED**

THQ may request and collect information from our online visitors on a voluntary basis and only during: (1) product registration; (2) contest registration; (3) demo or patch download; (4) registration for game-specific event participation; (5) online purchasing; (6) web site registration; and, (7) Customer Service and Technical support sessions. The requested information may include personal identifying information such as **your name, e-mail address, phone number, fax number, home address, and age**. Visitors purchasing goods or services through our Online Store will need to provide a valid credit card number and expiration date, in addition to the credit card holder's name, mailing address, phone number and e-mail address. In addition, THQ may collect demographic information such as platform preference, and magazine or retailer preference.

THQ collects personal information via conventional Internet forms. For example, a new user to our web site may be asked to register by providing his or her name, phone number, fax number, and home address. This information will then be associated with your e-mail account, so that you may identify yourself during future visits to our web site. THQ also stores and maintains personal information that you submit to us in an e-mail or that you post on our bulletin board. 

From time to time, however, THQ may employ third-party vendors, such as NetSales, to collect personal information on THQ's behalf. These third parties operate or sponsor some of the services we provide you including online product fulfillment, free e-mail, promotions, and contests and sweepstakes. When requesting these services, you may be asked to supply your name, mailing address, phone number, e-mail address, valid credit card number and expiration date. Although these third-party vendors, not THQ, collects the personal information you provide when requesting such services, THQ still requires that all third parties adhere to THQ's stated privacy policies.

**INFORMATION USAGE AND DISTRIBUTION**

The information you provide us is collected by THQ and may be shared with third-party vendors for the following reasons: (1) to inform you of new products, features and enhancements, promotional offers, and, contests and events of interest; (2) to fulfill prizes; (3) to provide you feedback on technical support or customer service inquiries; (4) to monitor and improve the use and satisfaction of our site; and, (5) for our internal marketing and demographic research, so we can improve our web site and products to better meet our visitors' requirements. Whatever our business objectives may be, we only collect and share information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill those objectives. In addition, third-party vendors have agreed to maintain the confidentiality and security of the information we share with them.

**REFUSAL TO PROVIDE PERSONAL INFORMATION**

THQ does not require registration or submission of personal information to obtain basic access to our web site; however, you may not be able to access all areas and functions of our web site, including the online sales area and the Customer Service and Technical Support area. You may contact our Customer Service center by phone or by mail if you have concerns about online submission of personal identifying information.

**OPT-OUT**

If you do not want THQ to send you e-mail or postal mail about our products and services, you can opt out at the time of registration or information collection, or at any time in the future by contacting THQ by e-mail at [privacypolicy@thq.com](mailto:privacypolicy@thq.com) or by mailing or faxing a request to THQ Inc., Privacy Policy Administrator, 27001 Agoura Road, Suite 325, Calabasas Hills, CA 91301; (fax) 818-871-7400.

**COOKIES AND IP ADDRESSES**

We use "cookies" on our web site. Cookies are very small data files left on your computer by our Site. These files can then be accessed by our Site in the future, so that you may resume a shopping session, etc. Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent, although this may affect your ability to shop online, both at THQ and elsewhere.

THQ also keeps track of Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses in order to support our Message Board software. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.

**Links to Other Sites**

You should be aware that when you are on THQ's web site, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from THQ's web site that may take you outside our service. We cannot guarantee that the privacy policies of these websites meet our high standards and the requirements of the ESRB Privacy Online Program. As always, we recommend reading the privacy policy of any new site you go to online.

**UPDATING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

If for any reason you wish to access, review, correct or delete the personal information collected about you, you may do so online at <http://www.thq.com/registration>. You must be able to provide your account name (e-mail address) and password. If you have forgotten your password, you may select the option to have it emailed to you. Once identified, we will be happy to review, update or remove your information as appropriate.Â 

**SAFEGUARDING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

THQ maintains appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of your personal information. For example, when you place an order, access your account information, or send us personal information at our request, the information collected moves into a secure server. THQ uses "Secure Socket Layers" ("SSL"), an advanced encryption technology that protects your credit card number and other personal information, including your name and address, so that no one can read it in transit. 

**CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OLD**

_Collection of Information_

Children under 13 may not participate in online activities that require registration without the prior written consent of a parent or legal guardian ("parent"). A copy of our permission form can be found at <http://www.thq.com/Policies/ParentPermission.pdf>. This form must be signed by the child's parent or legal guardian and returned to THQ by fax at (818) 871-7400 or by mailing to THQ Inc., Privacy Policy Administrator, 27001 Agoura Road, Suite 325, Calabasas Hills, CA 91301. Until we receive verifiable permission from a parent, a child under 13 may not submit or post his or her personal information on our site. 

In addition, we urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers, without permission, when using the Internet. Once we have obtained parental consent, we only ask the child for information that is reasonably necessary for the child to participate in our online activities. Parents also have the ability to consent to the collection of their children's information without consenting to the disclosure of that information to third parties. 

If a child submits personal information to our customer support, THQ collects that information solely for the purpose of responding to the child's one-time request. Once THQ has responded to the child's request, the information is deleted.

_Parental Access_

If you believe that any of your child's personal information is inaccurate, or if you wish to verify the information we have in our records, please contact the THQ Privacy Policy Administrator by sending an e-mail to [privacypolicy@thq.com](mailto:privacypolicy@thq.com), a facsimile to (818) 871-7400, or by writing to: Privacy Policy Administrator, c/o THQ Inc., 27001 Agoura Road, Suite 325, Calabasas Hills, CA 91301. We will check and update information as appropriate.
