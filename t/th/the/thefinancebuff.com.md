# Privacy Policy - The Finance Buff

## Privacy Policy

The privacy of visitors to thefinancebuff.com is important to me. 

At thefinancebuff.com, I recognize that privacy of your personal information is important. Here is information on what types of personal information I receive and collect when you use or visit thefinancebuff.com, and how I safeguard your information. I never sell your personal information to third parties.  


## Web Analytics Data

As with most other Web sites, I collect and use data from third party web analytics services. The information provided by the web analytics services include your IP address, your ISP (Internet Service Provider, such as Verizon or Cox Cable), the browser you used to visit the site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited the site and which pages you visited throughout the site.  


## Cookies and Web Beacons

The site does use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit the site. This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of the features. 

I also use third party advertisements on thefinancebuff.com to support the site. Some of these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) may use technologies such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on my site, which will also send these advertisers information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit my site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geo-targeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites). 

You can choose to disable or selectively turn off cookies from this site or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with this site as well as other Web sites. This could include the inability to login to certain services or programs.
