_**Updated March 28, 2011**_

PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THE RELATED TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS WEBSITE.

This website is operated by **CORPKA Entertainment** on behalf of **Kik Axe Music and Entertainment** ™

**Kik Axe Music** **and Entertainment™** (part of the CORPKA Entertainment Network [http://www.corpka.com](http://www.corpka.com/)) and its subsidiaries (collectively “Kik Axe”) respect the privacy concerns of all users. Protection of personal and sensitive information is paramount. This Privacy Policy discloses what type of information is collected, the method used to collect it and how Kik Axe utilizes the information to better serve all interested parties. Your use of any Kik Axe website constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy and any other applicable terms. The Terms of Service for this website are hereby incorporated by reference.

**Children**

Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. We recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of children and encourage parents to check and monitor their children’s use of online activities regularly. The Kik Axe website supports and complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and other laws. The Kik Axe website is not aimed at nor intended for children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not use the Kik Axe website. Our website does not accept registration from children under the age of 13. No personally identifiable information (as defined in the COPPA, 15 U.S.C. Section 6501) is purposefully or knowingly collected from children under the age of 13 by Kik Axe without parental consent. Every user hereby agrees that all information you provide, including but not limited to age, shall be truthful and correct. Kik Axe will not condition a child’s participation in an online activity on the child providing more personally identifiable information than is reasonably necessary for participation in such activity.

**Information We Collect**

Kik Axe gathers, analyzes and/or stores personal information generally by way of four different sources: (1) the personal information voluntarily submitted by visitors when using or registering to use our services; (2) the personal and contact information visitors voluntarily provide when participating in any contests, sweepstakes and/or other promotions; (3) through merchandise purchase or pre-order transactions; and/or (4) by analyzing data through mechanisms that identify site usage, browser types, IP servers, etc. Kik Axe strives to provide our visitors with information relevant to their particular desires, needs and/or concerns. The information we gather helps us to better serve our purpose.

**General Data**  
General data includes information about you such as your name, address, email, and preferences. This information is generally gathered when you voluntarily submit the information to Kik Axe for purposes of, including but not limited to, registering for newsletters and/or contests or because you wish Kik Axe to provide you with our products, services or information. Such information allows Kik Axe to personalize your experience and helps Kik Axe better understand the demographics of our audience.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small piece of information sent to your computer’s browser, which is stored on the hard drive of your computer. There are two kinds of cookies Kik Axe operates: those that are “session” oriented and those that are “expiration” oriented. Session cookies delete from your computer at the moment you close your browser. Conversely, expiration cookies can be programmed to expire at any time; therefore when you close your browser, the cookie will remain on your hard drive until its expiration. Should you wish to be notified of, or to accept or decline cookies from being stored on your hard drive, please refer to your internet help directions.

To better provide you with excellent service, we may use cookies to remember information about your activities on our website. For example, cookies can track merchandise you’ve ordered, can save your password for effortless login or can remember your preferences for a more tailored visit.

**Sensitive Information**

There are two ways sensitive information (e.g. credit card numbers) may be obtained. When a visitor makes a purchase, his/her information may be sent directly to a third party authorization center that will relay to Kik Axe whether to proceed with the transaction. The information is not at all stored in our system. The second way is when a visitor pre-orders merchandise. In this case, the information is sent to a non-public server and stored until the transaction is complete.

Kik Axe uses all possible efforts to ensure the safety of your sensitive information. No website, internet transmission, computer system or wireless connection is completely secure. Kik Axe cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. Your use of the Kik Axe website is at your own risk. Kik Axe urges you to take steps to keep your information safe by memorizing your password or keeping it in a safe place (separate from your account information), logging out of your account, and closing your web browser.

Whenever you give Kik Axe sensitive or confidential information, Kik Axe will take commercially reasonable steps to protect the information by establishing a secure connection with your web browser. Kik Axe uses the Security Socket Layer (“SSL”), an industry standard security protocol for encrypting sensitive information. Unless otherwise specified herein or on the site where you make a purchase, credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for marketing purposes.

**Non Identifying Information**

Kik Axe gathers and analyzes non-identifying user information such as Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses and browser types for statistical purposes only. Your IP address is an identifying number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the internet and is done automatically by many websites. In order to better aim our application efforts, we may record and tally information for the purpose of, including but not limited to, measuring our traffic and determining the origin of the audience.

**External Links**

Kik Axe may contain links to, or advertisements about, non-Kik Axe websites. Other sites may also reference, advertise, or link to Kik Axe websites. Kik Axe does not endorse or sponsor other websites, is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of non-Kik Axe sites, expressly disclaims any statements or assertions made on such websites, and denies all liability associated with your use of, and the content on, such other websites and advertisements.
