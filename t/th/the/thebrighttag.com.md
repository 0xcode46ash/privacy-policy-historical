We may use cookies to identify your device when you revisit our Website, to recall your authentication information, or to store information related to your navigation throughout the Website. These uses help us better operate the Website and enhance your visit by remembering your preferences and displaying personalized content.

These companies – our vendors – are contractually bound by BrightTag to use personal information that we share with them only to perform the services we have hired them to provide and to process any such information in accordance with the data protection principles set forth in this Privacy Policy. BrightTag will take reasonable measures to prevent or stop its agents from using or disclosing such information in violation of the principles set forth in this Policy to the extent that BrightTag becomes aware of such actions.

From time to time, we may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of the Website, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Website, how long they stay on that page and which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on. We collect this information through the use of “cookies” and other tracking technologies, which are discussed in greater detail above in the section on cookies. We collect this information in order to determine which areas of the Website are most popular and to enhance the Website for visitors. As with other aggregated data, we may disclose such data to our existing or potential business partners, affiliates, sponsors or other third parties, but this aggregate data will in no way personally identify you or any other visitors to the Website.

### I. Links to Other Sites

BrightTag makes no representation about any third-party websites that may be accessed via links from this Website.

### J. Security of Information and Disclosures

BrightTag uses industry standard security measures to safeguard information concerning, and submitted by, users like you and takes reasonable precautions to protect personal information in its possession from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

BrightTag will, to the extent possible, secure your personal information, and, except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties. Although we are committed to maintaining the confidentiality of your personal information, if required by law, we reserve the right to disclose such information without first obtaining your consent.

### K. Verification of Compliance with this Policy and Enforcement

BrightTag conducts periodic audits of its privacy practices in order to verify compliance with this Privacy Policy. Any employee or contractor that BrightTag finds to be in violation of this Policy will be subject to disciplinary procedures that could result in termination.

Any questions, concerns or complaints relating to the use or disclosure of personal information by BrightTag in its capacity as a data controller should be directed to Mike Sands, CEO, at privacy@brighttag.com. BrightTag will investigate and seek to resolve any complaints or disputes in accordance with the principles set forth in this Policy.

Any complaint that cannot be resolved in this manner will be referred to confidential binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in Chicago, Illinois, or another forum mutually agreed upon by the complainant and BrightTag, pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules (“Rules”) of the AAA by a sole arbitrator nominated by agreement of the complainant and BrightTag and confirmed in accordance with the Rules.

## III. BrightTag’s Tag Management Service Privacy Policy

### A. Our Tag Management Service

BrightTag uses its proprietary tag management technology to provide data processing services (“the Services”) that enable owners of other websites (the “Customers”) to manage and control the collection of data derived from their website(s) and its distribution to various third party marketing and technology partners. BrightTag acts as a data processor on behalf of its Customers and not as a data controller in relation to any personal data that is collected, stored, processed or distributed as part of BrightTag’s provision of the Services.

BrightTag’s tag management technology consists of proprietary JavaScript or other code, which may be placed on or within the Customers’ web pages, systems or platforms in accordance with the Customer’s instructions pursuant to a service agreement with BrightTag. If so instructed by the Customer, BrightTag may set, read, and modify cookies or other stored content objects on the browsers of visitors to the Customer’s website(s). As a result, data pertaining to such visitors (“User Data”), which may include personal data, may be collected by BrightTag on behalf of the Customer.

BrightTag does not have any relationship, contractual or otherwise, with visitors to its Customers’ websites. BrightTag’s service agreements with its Customers require them to provide notice of, and obtain consent for, the transfer of User Data to BrightTag for processing and for onward transfer to third parties, where required by applicable law. Any personal data collected by BrightTag on behalf of its Customers is carried out under the instructions of its Customers. Personal data collected from Customers that are established in the European Economic Area will be processed pursuant to data transfer agreements between BrightTag and each Customer in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the EU Standard Contractual Clauses for Processors.

### B. Information We Collect

Most of the information collected by BrightTag when providing the Services to its Customers is not personal data or is anonymized data. In circumstances where BrightTag collects and processes personal information, BrightTag acts as a data processor and the collection, processing and storage of any such data is subject to the Customer’s sole direction and control.

BrightTag does not itself collect, and requires that its Customers notify visitors as required by applicable laws before using the Services to collect or transfer, data elements that are considered to be sensitive in some jurisdictions, namely personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, or the processing of data concerning health or sex life.

The types of User Data that Customers may instruct BrightTag to process include, for example:

  * IP address and other information that a visitor’s device sends to identify itself to network servers, and configuration information about a visitor’s web browser and device;
  * Information about visitor interactions with a Customer’s website, such as content viewed and products purchased;
  * Information that visitors have provided to a Customer, including information about personal interests and information that may personally identify visitors, such as name, address, phone number and email address;
  * Anonymous demographic data, such as age, gender and location; and
  * Data that anonymously identifies your web browser and device to one or more third-party services.



### C. How We Use the Information We Collect

BrightTag does not control User Data but may temporarily store and process such data, and transfer it to Customer-approved third parties, in order to provide the Services to our Customers pursuant to their instructions and control.

Each Customer that BrightTag serves is responsible for establishing and complying with its own privacy policy. In accordance with the terms and conditions of BrightTag’s service agreements with our Customers, each Customer is responsible for ensuring compliance with any applicable laws relating to the provision of notice to, obtaining consent from, and responding to the withdrawal of consent (“opt out”) from visitors to its website whose personal data may be processed or whose devices may be subject to the application of cookies or similar types of stored content objects by BrightTag pursuant to instructions issued by the Customer.

### D. Transfers of Information to Third Parties

BrightTag does not transfer any User Data to third parties except in accordance with the Customer’s explicit instructions. BrightTag’s service agreement with its Customers requires them to provide notice of, and obtain any consent for, the transfer of such data to third parties, in accordance with applicable law.

### E. Security of Information and Disclosures

BrightTag uses industry standard security measures to safeguard the information that it processes and takes reasonable precautions to protect personal information in its possession from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

BrightTag will, to the extent possible, secure any personal data and, except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy, will not disclose such data to third parties. Although BrightTag is committed to maintaining the confidentiality of personal data, if required by law, BrightTag reserves the right to disclose such information without first obtaining consent.
