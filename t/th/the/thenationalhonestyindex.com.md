# Honest Tea Privacy Policy & Terms of Use | Honest Tea

#### Honesttea.com Privacy Policy

This website is owned and operated by Honest Tea, Inc. At Honest Tea, we recognize that visitors to our site may be concerned about the information they provide to us and how we handle that information. We’ve prepared this website Privacy Policy to address those concerns. This policy relates only to information collected through this website.

#### Personally-Identifiable Information

On our website, we may collect certain personally-identifiable information about our online visitors. Personally-identifiable information relates to an individual consumer – for example, name, address, telephone number and e-mail address. You may provide personally-identifiable information, for example, by entering a promotion. We don’t require you to register or provide personally-identifiable information to view our site or access much of its content. Here are the ways we collect personally-identifiable information.

#### Contests, Sweepstakes and Games

Our site contains notices of contests, sweepstakes and games we are conducting, which you may enter electronically in some cases. We use the information you provide to conduct the promotion (for example, to contact you if you’re a winner). We won’t use the information you for any other purpose unless you’ve agreed otherwise.

#### Other Site Features

We offer visitors to our website various features for their enjoyment, which we change from time to time. We may ask you to submit certain personally-identifiable information so we can provide you with these features.

#### Aggregate and Non-Personal Information

We collect certain aggregate and non-personal information when you visit our website. Aggregate and non-personal information does not relate to a single, identifiable visitor. It tells us how many users visited our site or the pages accessed. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our website to our visitors. We collect this information through “cookie” technology, as explained below.

#### Cookies

Like many companies, we use “cookies” on our website. Cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer’s hard drive when you visit certain websites. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site.  
When you visit our website, cookies are placed on your computer. We use cookies to tell us, for example, whether you’ve visited us before or if you’re a new visitor. We collect this information to enhance your experience on our website.

#### How We Use Personally-Identifiable Information

If you ask to be contacted by us, we may use the information you provide to contact you from time to time. For example, we may (i) send you promotional materials and other communications you request, (ii) respond to your comments or questions, or (iii) contact you if needed while processing service you requested through our website.  
We also use personally-identifiable information about you to improve our website features and content and to analyze website usage. In addition, we use personally-identifiable information for market research purposes. We also may use personally-identifiable information about you to deliver content that is customized to your interests as we understand from the information you’ve provided to us and your activities on the site.

#### How We Share Personally-Identifiable Information

Except as described below, we don’t sell, transfer or otherwise disclose to third parties the personally-identifiable information we collect on this website without your prior consent. We disclose information where we think it’s necessary to investigate or prevent an actual or suspected crime or injury to ourselves or others or where disclosure is required by law. We also may disclose information in response to a request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials.

On our website, we may conduct joint promotions with other companies. We may share with our promotional partners (and their service providers) certain personally-identifiable information as necessary to conduct the promotion. We will not share this information with our promotional partners for any other purpose unless you tell us it’s ok to do so.

We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to require that the transferee use personal information provided through this website in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.

#### Links to Other Websites

This website may contain links to other websites. We provide these links solely for your convenience and information. Different websites have different privacy practices. You should always check the privacy policy of the specific site you’re visiting to understand the privacy practices associated with that site.

#### Children’s Privacy

Some portions of our website may be directed to kids under 13. In these areas of our website, our conduct is governed by federal law and regulations that address children’s online privacy.

We do not knowingly collect personally-identifiable information from kids under 13 on our website. We sometimes offer promotions on our website, such as contests or sweepstakes. We may permit a child to enter promotions directed to children by submitting a first name and e-mail address only, along with the name and e-mail address of the child’s parent. We then notify the parent about the child’s entry and offer the parent an opportunity to withdraw the entry and remove the submitted information from our database. If the parent permits the child’s participation in the promotion and the child wins, we contact the parent (not the child) for further information needed for any prize delivery. Unless the parent has explicitly consented, we do not (i) use the child’s personal information for any purpose other than to complete the promotion or (ii) share the information with third parties except as described above in this Privacy Policy. We do not retain the child’s or the parent’s personally-identifiable information in our database unless the parent has given us permission to do so.

Upon proper identification, a parent may review any personal information we have collected from his or her child if we still have the information in our database. The parent also may request that the child’s information be deleted from our database and may refuse to permit further collection or use of the child’s information. If you are a parent and wish to exercise these rights, please contact us as described below.

#### How We Protect Personally-Identifiable Information

The security of personally-identifiable information is important to us. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized use, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the personally-identifiable information we collect on this website.

#### Updates to This Privacy Policy

We may change or update portions of this Privacy Policy at any time. Please check back from time to time so you are aware of any changes or updates to the Policy. We will indicate the Policy’s effective date on the first page of the Policy.
