# Privacy Policy - The Best Colleges

## Terms of Use and Privacy Policy for Use of TheBestColleges.org (Effective January 5, 2016)

Thank you for using our site content and services. This page will explain how TheBestColleges.org gathers and utilizes different kinds of information to provide users with content and related products and services. By using our website, you are agreeing to these Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. 

We generally collect two kinds of information: submitted information and automatic information. Submitted information is the data users voluntarily submit through our web forms, which may be personal contact information (such as name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address), as well any other information that may be required to match users to an education product or service. This helps us provide the services requested by our visitors. Submitted information is collected, stored and shared with schools and other third parties as necessary to provide users with information about education-related services, in addition to schools and programs.

By submitting this information, you authorize TheBestColleges.org, as well as our affiliated schools and partners, to contact you in accordance with all applicable laws by phone, text messages, email or mail regarding education options or related topics. If you receive any email communications from us, a school, or third party, you will be afforded the ability to unsubscribe through a link in the email, at which point you will be removed from further mailings from that sender.

In addition, TheBestColleges.org collects automatic information. This includes certain types of anonymous information whenever you interact with us. This information is useful for improvements and for creating a more relevant and tailored user experience. For example, we use “cookies” to collect anonymous data for analytics, site optimization and for tailored advertising and marketing purposes. Examples of this kind of information include, but are not limited to, your browser version, operating system version, and your IP address. 

By utilizing our website, you acknowledge and agree that automatic information collected on our website may be shared with schools, affiliated companies, and third parties for the purpose of providing information about degrees, programs and other education-related products and services. You also acknowledge and agree that we retain the right to release any collected information, including personally identifiable information, as needed, to businesses providing our company with administration services (such as an email delivery service, for example). In addition, through this action, you grant us, our affiliates, and partners and vendors the right to contact you for a period of time, and relinquish any rights granted to you by the Do Not Call list or other applicable law. Your submission serves as an omission to Do Not Call requirements established by state and federal governments and may exempt us from other applicable laws.

We also retain the right to release your personal information in instances required by law. For example, to abide by a subpoena or other legal procedure, when, in good faith, we believe it is necessary to preserve our rights, ensure the safety of you or others, explore alleged fraud, to reply to a government or legal request, and/or in the instance that TheBestColleges.org is merging, acquisitioning, or selling some or all of its assets to a third party.

_It is possible that we will revise our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy in the future if we change our practices. We recommend that you reread this document periodically to stay up-to-date with our practices concerning your privacy and other important information._

Cookies are small pieces of data sent from a website and stored in the user’s web browser, including for technical purposes such as web analytics. Our web analytics are primarily performed using Google Analytics, a tool provided by Google, Inc. Advertising cookies do not contain personally identifiable information, allowing users to remain anonymous. However, they do permit advertisers to make ads more relevant to the user’s interests. Advertising cookies are sometimes referred to as third-party cookies because they track navigation and publish ads on behalf of third parties.

We, including activities through services and partnerships with vendors and third-party service providers, may use cookies for the following purposes:

  * Web analytics such as demographic and other anonymous data for web optimization and other analysis
  * “Lead auditing” to ensure the accuracy, relevance and validity of submitted information
  * Marketing and conversion-tracking cookies for, but not limited to, targeting and optimizing digital ad serving to improve relevance, user experience, and advertising effectiveness



You can remove cookies through your browser settings at any time, though you may need to do this on a per use and not one-time basis. You can also generally opt-out of receiving personalized ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt-out pages on the NAI website and DAA website.
