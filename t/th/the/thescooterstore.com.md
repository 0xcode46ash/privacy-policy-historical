# The SCOOTER Store ? Privacy Policy

## Privacy Policy 

##### Our Commitment to Privacy

Our Privacy Policy was developed as an extension of our commitment to combine the highest quality products and services with the highest level of integrity in dealing with visitors to our site. The Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how this site collects, uses and safeguards the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our site.

##### What Information Do We Collect and How Do We Use It?

When you visit this site you may provide The SCOOTER Store with two types of information: personal information you knowingly and actively choose to disclose to The SCOOTER Store that is collected on an individual basis ("Active Information") and site user information collected, in a way not visible to you, on an aggregate basis as you and others browse this site ("Passive Information").

##### Active Information You Choose to Disclose

When you submit information to our site, The SCOOTER Store may collect your name, address and other personal information. The SCOOTER Store uses such information only so that one of our representatives may contact you to further discuss your inquiries, which may include employment opportunities with The SCOOTER Store. Email addresses are collected to build "House Lists" for future marketing campaigns that you may opt out of at anytime. If you choose to correspond further with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with your email address and our responses.

##### Passive Information Collected

Our site uses a standard feature of web browser software technology called "cookies" to "passively" collect information about how this site is used. Passive Information gathered may include the date and time of visits, browser information, the site pages viewed, time spent on this site, and the IP address of the computer assessing our site. IP addresses are collected solely for troubleshooting that may occur (We may use the IP information to conduct research on questionable leads that have come through the Internet). Passive Information is collected on an aggregate basis without any association to your personal information so that you may remain anonymous. If you do not wish to transmit "cookie" information about yourself, you may turn off the cookie function in your web browser (please consult the "Help" section of your browser to do so).

We use Passive Information to gather information about our site's users for marketing campaigns and to enhance and design this site to make it easier, faster and friendlier to use. Additionally, cookies help The SCOOTER Store know more information about how many people visit this site, when they visit, and how they use this site.

##### How Do We Secure Active and Passive Information?

We secure Active and Passive Information by using industry standard encryption protection to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure of, or accidental loss or destruction of, such Active and Passive Information. Unfortunately, however, no information is 100% secure when transmitted over the Internet. Once we receive your information, we use our best efforts to ensure its security on our systems.

##### Do We Share Information?

We may provide aggregate Passive Information about site traffic patterns and related site information to our affiliates or reputable third parties, but this information will not include personally identifying data. Except as stated below in this section, we do not sell or share your Active Information. We may sell or share except your Active Information, to provide services and products you have requested or when we have your consent.

We may also share your Active Information with carefully selected third-party vendors, who may use the Active Information shared to provide special opportunities and offers to you. Your Active Information will be shared with Medicare to further process your application for products being sold to you by The SCOOTER Store.

##### How Can You Choose Not to Receive Information from Us or to Correct Your Information?

If you wish to access, delete or correct your information, please access our contact information at [http://www.thescooterstore.com/contactus/](https://web.archive.org/contactus/). From this link, you may also elect to be removed from our marketing lists by selecting Stop Direct Mail. Please note that if you choose to delete your information, it may be impossible for us to ensure that your information has been deleted from every file we maintain, i.e., from back-up files no longer used. We will, however, remove your Active Information from all actively used files.

##### What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?

We are not responsible for the practices employed by sites linked to or from our site nor the information or content contained therein. Often links to other sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our site. 

Please remember that when you use a link to go from our site to another site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other site, including sites which have a link on our site, is subject to that site's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.

##### What About Children's Privacy?

Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally-identifiable information from any person we know is a child under the age of 13. If we discover that we have received any information from a child under age 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately.

##### Granting Your Consent? 

By using our site you consent to our collection and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. 

##### HIPAA - Notice of Privacy Practices

We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at our discretion. Please check back on this site as this Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time without notice to you.
