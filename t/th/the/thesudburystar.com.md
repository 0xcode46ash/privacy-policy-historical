We also wish to inform you that the risks associated with the supplying of personal information in a chat room, via e-mail or on a web-based message board are not covered by our privacy protection policy; thus, you must be extremely careful if you choose to supply personal information through these means. You are submitting this information at your own risk. Indeed, this information may be collected and used by third parties without your prior consent.

Sun Media declines all responsibility in this regard. We urge you to remain cautious and vigilant, at all times, on the Internet. 

  * ## IV- Security

Sun Media has set up security measures to protect you from the loss or unauthorized use of your supplied personal information. As well, our Sun Media servers are equipped with firewall technology. Despite these measures, and given that no technology is foolproof, we must advise you that there will always remain a certain amount of risk and that your personal information may be disclosed, without your consent, unintentionally, and without fault on the part of Sun Media. Sun Media declines any responsibility in the event that such confidential information is disclosed, unless caused by negligence on the part of the Sun Media. 

  * ## V- Protection of children and teens on the Internet

Children and teenagers are increasingly using the Internet and discovering its many advantages. However, as is the case in many other environments, their greater vulnerability may be targeted for crime and exploitation. This is why we urge you to monitor the Internet use of your children and teenagers and provide them with advice on security and recommendations based on common sense. Such measures will often prevent your children and teenagers from being exposed to offensive content, or from becoming victims of harassment or other criminal acts. 

To reduce these risks, as a parent, you should exercise a reasonable amount of supervision of Internet use by your children and teenagers. They should be told to never give out their personal information, such as their name, address or phone number, on any Internet forum. 

It is also important that children and teenagers be encouraged to share their concerns with you in the event that they receive disturbing or provocative messages. 

These recommendations will help your children and teenagers surf the Internet in an informed fashion and allow you to ensure that they fully benefit from the learning and development possibilities that exist online.
