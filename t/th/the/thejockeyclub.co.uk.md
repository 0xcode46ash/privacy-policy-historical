The Jockey Club (“we”, “our”, “us”) takes your privacy very seriously. Please read this Policy carefully to see how we will treat the personal information that you provide to us either when using this website (the “Site”) or in other circumstances when we collect data from you. We will take reasonable care to keep your information secure and to prevent any unauthorised access or use of it. We process all information in accordance with applicable UK data protection legislation. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time and the change will take effect once the revised Privacy Policy is available on this Site. Therefore, please refer to this policy each time you submit your personal information.

  Please note that if you choose to participate in any discussion forum on the Site you may disclose personal information about yourself to other participants. If you do so this is at your own risk.

  **Collection and Management of Information**  
This Site is hosted on behalf of The Jockey Club by Haymarket Network of Teddington Studios, Broom Road, Teddington, Middlesex TW11 9BE (“Haymarket”). As a result Haymarket may have access to and process the information that you provide to us on the Site.

  We, our holding, subsidiary and sister companies and selected third parties (such as our commercial partners) would like to send you marketing information, by post, e-mail, or SMS. We will only do this if you have indicated that you are happy to receive such information when you submit your details to us. 

  If you submit your views to us via our contact form we will circulate them internally for training and management purposes. We may also publish your views on this Site, or in other media. If you do not want us to do this, please let us know when you submit your views. 

  We may aggregate the information you send to us with other data (so that you cannot be identified from that data) and use that aggregated data for administrative purposes and/or share it with other people.

  **Sharing information**  
We will share your information with our affiliates and third party service providers only if this is necessary or reasonably required for any of the purposes above. Such third party service providers are not entitled to use your information for their own purposes. We may also share your information with our commercial partners for marketing purposes (in accordance with the paragraph entitled “How The Jockey Club uses the information” above) if you have indicated that you are happy to receive such information. Some of these third parties may be located outside of the United Kingdom, including in countries where data protection laws might not exist or be of a lower standard than the EU. If you wish to opt out of this, please email info@thejockeyclub.co.uk.

  **Protection information**  
We are committed to protecting your privacy and we implement various security measures in relation to our processing and transfer of personal data. However, the nature of the Internet is such that the data may in some circumstances flow over networks without full security measures and could be accessible to unauthorised persons.
