Additionally, you may choose to register a website user name and/or password so that we can communicate with you, provide the services you have requested and to provide a more personalized experience on our website. You are not required to provide us with this information, but if you choose not to do so, you may not be able to participate in some of the activities on our website. 

We may also offer you the choice of whether to receive mailings from others that we think will be of interest.   In order to keep you informed about the operation of our services, we may also send emails and announcements that are needed for the proper functioning and administration of our website and services.

## **TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES**

Our website has features that automatically collect information from you to assist us in creating a website that honor your preferences and serves your needs.   In certain instances, our website uses cookies, which are small data files containing information about you that are stored on your hard drive.  Cookies are embedded in the HTTP information that travels back and forth between your computer and the servers.  Cookies allow automated customer customization and personalization, and, for example, cookies may be utilized to assure that a sweepstakes applicant enters any given sweepstakes only once or to store session preferences.   Our website may also use retargeting cookies.  You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by adjusting the settings of your browser. If you set your browser to decline cookies, you may be limited in using some areas of our website.  If you use our website without setting your browser to decline cookies, you are agreeing that we may use cookies to customize your website experience.

In addition to automatically collecting information from you, our website may also access, but not collect, additional information from you (such as browser header information, browser type and IP address) in order to customize your website experience.

## **HOW YOUR INFORMATION MAY BE USED**

We use the information collected from you to allow you to participate in the website activities for which the information is collected.  For example, when you provide an email address in order to receive updates on a particular title or type of show, that address is added to the email list for that title or type of show. We sometimes use the information collected to communicate with you, such as to notify you when we make changes to our subscriber agreements, to fulfill your request for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us. From time to time, we may also use this information to offer products, programs or services to our customers.   When we have co-branded or sponsored services, when we host a site or when we join with other parties to provide specific services, we may share (provide and/or receive) your personally identifiable information with them. We may also share your information with others if you choose to let us do so, such as where we offer opt-in or opt-out choices.

Such information will not include personally identifiable information such as your name or email address. Aggregate information collected about the users of our website may also be used to improve our services, for marketing purposes and industry reporting purposes. Additionally, we may share your personally identifiable information in the event of a corporate change (such as a merger, acquisition or sale of assets).
