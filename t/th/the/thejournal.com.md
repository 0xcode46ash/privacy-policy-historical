##### Collected Information

The information we collect is gathered from several sources. These include our websites, conferences, product subscriptions and survey information via telephone, e-mail, and direct mail. For each visitor to our websites, our web server automatically recognizes only the visitor’s domain name and IP address, but not the e-mail address. In addition, we collect aggregate information on what web pages visitors access or visit, and information volunteered by the visitor, such as survey information, and/or site registrations. We collect postal addresses, e-mail addresses, and/or telephone numbers of visitors who post messages to our bulletin boards, make postings to our websites, and/or voluntarily subscribe to our print or digital magazines and/or e-mail newsletters. In addition, we collect information from our conferences (e.g., attendees, exhibitors, speakers).

##### How We Use Collected Information

The information we collect is used to improve the content of our web pages, to customize the content and layout of our pages for each individual visitor, and/or to notify visitors about updates to our website. As part of a subscription and/or registration agreement, subscribers and conference registrants will be contacted by us through mail, e-mail, and/or phone to communicate with them about their subscription and/or registration. Subscribers will be contacted for renewal, re-qualification, surveys, updates concerning their account profile and special offers related to their subscription and/or registration. We also use the information to contact them for marketing purposes and share it with other reputable organizations to allow them to contact our subscribers/registrants for pre-screened marketing purposes. We do share non-personal, aggregate statistics about our members, sales, demographics, traffic patterns, and related website and product information with advertisers and reputable third party vendors for marketing and promotional purposes; however, none of the information we disclose in this aggregate form can be used to personally identify you. Certain information — such as your password and credit card number — is never disclosed in any form whatsoever to any outside party. 

##### E-mail Communications

Subscribers that have registered for our products and/or services, and have supplied an e-mail address, will receive emails pertaining to your subscription and/or registration. These are sent in order to maintain your account with 101communications. Subscribers/registrants can “opt-out” from receiving these types of e-mails by using the opt-out mechanism located within the received e-mail message.

For marketing e-mails, we retain three types of permission for usage of your submitted e-mail address as defined below. We allow subscribers to “opt out” of receiving marketing e-mails about 101communications products or from outside companies either at the time of subscription, in response to a received e-mail or within this Privacy Policy website.

  * **E-mails about Related Products and Services**  
Subscribers that provided information at the time of registration may from time to time be contacted by us about related products, services and/or upcoming events grouped with your subscription account within one of the [IT Publishing Groups](https://web.archive.org/grouplist.asp) that comprise 101communications.

As a result of your visit to our site, ad server companies may collect information such as your domain type, your IP address, and clickstream information.

##### Security

101communications takes every precaution to protect your information from unauthorized use. When you submit sensitive information via our websites, the information is protected both online and offline. When our registration/subscription form asks for credit card number, or other sensitive information, that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry – SSL.

##### Policy Updates

From time to time, we may use provided information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy policy. If our information practices change at some time in the future, we will immediately post the policy changes to this Website to notify you of these changes.
