## Website Privacy Policy

Welcome to The Ride Channel, a website operated by 900 Films, Inc. ("900 Films", "we", "us", "our") within the COMPLEX MEDIA, INC. (“Complex”) network. This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information when you access the services and other features or functionality (collectively, the "Service") on www.theridechannel.com ("Site"). We receive information about you from various sources, including through your use of the Service and from various third party websites and other services. When you use the Service, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Your Personal Information may be processed by us in the country where it was collected as well as other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country. Any capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meaning given to them in our Terms of Use.

When you provide us Personal Information, we share it with Complex, who operates this Site on our behalf as part of its network of websites. We do not control Complex’s use of such Personal Information and you should review Complex’s privacy policy available at www.complex.com/privacy. As a result of this disclosure, your username and password will work on other Complex websites and Complex may aggregate information it collects from you on this Site and on other Complex websites. Please do not share Personal Information with us if you do not wish for such Personal Information to be accessed and used by Complex.

**What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?**

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any other sites, services and applications, including YouTube, Facebook, Google+ and Twitter ("Third Party Services"), that you elect to access through the Service. While we attempt to provide access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.

**What Information Do We Collect?**

When we use the phrase "Personal Information", we mean information that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. “Anonymous Information” means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information; Anonymous Information does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons.

**The information we gather from users enables us to personalize, operate, provide and improve our Service. We collect the following types of information from our users.**

**Personal Information Collected:**

We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily at registration and in the course of your use of the Site and/or Services. By creating an account or by signing in for the Service using a Third Party Service (as discussed below), you may provide us certain Personal Information, and you may allow others, including us, to identify you.

**Third Party Services:**

As mentioned above, we may allow you to link your accounts to Third Party Services, such as YouTube, Facebook, Google+ and Twitter ("Third Party Accounts") to the Service. If you elect to link to such Third Party Services, we may collect information related to your use of that Third Party Service, such as access tokens made available by that Third Party Service, and other content or information that is provided to us from that Third Party Service. For example, we may receive additional information about you through that Third Party Service, such as gender, age, education, occupation, hobbies, interests, relationship status, and zip code. Third Party Services may also have the ability to restrict the information that is provided to us. Moreover, we don’t actually store your passwords for those Third Party Accounts. Instead, we just use an authentication token to verify your user name. You can revoke our access to any Third Party Service at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within your account settings on the applicable Third Party Service.

Any information that you elect to distribute through any of these Third Party Services by using the Service is provided to such Third Party Services and, after leaving our servers, becomes accessible by such Third Party Services. Therefore, in addition to reviewing this Privacy Policy, you should also review the privacy policies and terms of use of the Third Party Services that you access through the Service. We will not be responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such Third Party Services; (ii) the content, products or services on or availability of such Third Party Services; or (iii) your use of any such Third Party Services

**Email Communications:**

We may receive email activity data from your personal email provider.

**Public Information**

To the extent you post Personal Information in comments in a publicly available area of our Site or Services, it will be available to other users of the Site who may use it at their discretion. Please be thoughtful about the information that you post in any forums or comments.

**Anonymous Information Collected Automatically:**

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Service. We automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested.

Generally, our Service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the Service so that we can improve and make the Service appealing to as many users as possible, and improve. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use the Site and Services.

**Cookies:**

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our Site are visited and by how many people.

Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Service or all functionality of the Service.

Flash LSOs. When we post videos, third parties may use local shared objects, known as “Flash Cookies,” to store your preferences for volume control or to personalize certain video features. Flash Cookies are different from browser Cookies because of the amount and type of data and how the data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash Cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash Cookies, click here: http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html.

**Third Party Cookies and Web Beacons:**

We and our authorized third party partners may use device identification, cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to deliver more relevant advertising and communications to consumers. This advertising is sometimes called interest-based or online behavioral advertising. Such advertisements are generally targeted and served to particular users (as described in more detail below) and may come from third party companies called "ad networks". Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. We do not provide Personal Information to any ad networks for use outside of the Services.

Interest-based advertisements may be targeted to users who fit a certain general profile category, may be based on anonymized information inferred from information provided to us by a user (including Personal Information such as gender or age), may be based on usage patterns of particular users on the Services, or may be based on your activity on Third Party Services. Ad networks may set cookies through our Site that enable them to retarget you on other sites.

If you would like an ad network to not set or use cookies on your computer or mobile device, you can visit the following sitehttp://www.aboutads.info/choices/.

We may also use third party services such as Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Site. Google Analytics uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Site and Services. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Site, rather than your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with your Personal Information. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Site, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.

We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other websites. When linking to another website, you should read the privacy policy stated on that website.

You should always use caution and common sense when choosing to provide Personal Information on the Internet.

We want you to feel confident using the Service and endeavor to protect your Personal Information we hold in our records. However, no system can be completely secure. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.

Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their Personal Information and should avoid sending Personal Information through insecure e-mail.

Certain information is necessary in order for us to provide the Services; therefore, if you delete such necessary information you may not be able to use the Services.
