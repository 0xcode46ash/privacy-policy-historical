## Customer Testimonials

I just wanted The Watchery and other potential customers to know what a wonderful experience I had with their company. I am a first time purchaser from The Watchery and placed my order online on Sunday. Unlike other companies, they have a great verification system where they will telephone you with an automated pin number which you simply type to confirm. I have ordered from other online watch companies and they take forever to verify your order (this is usually when your order is for a large amount.) I searched online for The Watchery coupons and found one for 10% of all Gucci watches. Then, my order was shipped on Monday morning next day UPS air for no extra charge!!! (Not everyone may qualify for this, but my order was for a pricey Gucci!) Anyway, nice gesture. I received it on Tuesday morning by 9:30 am. The watch was surely authentic (not my first Gucci), very well-packaged, and wrapped in a The Watchery tote bag. Very cute. To top it all off, I live in Texas and they set the time for my time zone (they ship from a different time zone.) These are small, but very much appreciated, gestures that will make me order time and time again (when I have the money!) Folks, you can't go wrong with this company. I am very impressed and I think you will be too!

Sincerely,

Laura Rupp

Just wanted to thank you for your recommendation and assitance for another graduation watch for my daughter. I asked her what she wanted. She asked what was possible. I said anything but me paying off her loans OR a watch. She said "but daddy I really need a nice watch"

She came down last week and we talked again about graduation -- she said she really could use a watch. I said no way, ain't gonna happen -- besides her WAtch was fine. I said let me see it. She gave hers to me, I turned my back, put it in my pocket and handed the new one back. Once she realized it wasn't hers, she was floored.

Thanks for making her day!
