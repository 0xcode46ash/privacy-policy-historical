## Customer Testimonials

Good Morning Miriam,

Thank you very much. Now, I can say with confidence if any family members ask where we got our son's watch, The Watchery will be our response and with a very good story to tell.

You know Miriam, my husband & I typically do not spend that kind of $$ for a watch, but it was for our son's graduation, and he loved it...So, I thank you most sincerely for your service.

Today, customer service is not like it used to be, but at The Watchery...it is.

Hi. My name is Ben and I had the distinct pleasure of working with Zack to purchase a men's Concord Delirium 18kt gold watch with diamonds on the sides of the bezel (your item 0311002). It arrived as promised, on time, new but the fit was a bit snug.

I then had the distinct pleasure of speaking with Carlotta who then introduced me to Molly. I also had the distinct privilege to chat and e-mail Eddie Shaer who got Katy to get in touch with me and now the whole thing seems to be handled quite well and to my great satisfaction.

I want to express my gratitude to all of you who made this (somewhat expensive) sale, go smoothly from start to finish. I would rate The Watchery as follows;

Sales 100%  
Customer Service 100%  
Cust. Service after sale 100%  
Overall Cust. Satisfaction 110%  
Referral to Friends/Family 100%

Thanks to each and every one of you for making this special gift, that more special.

Ben
