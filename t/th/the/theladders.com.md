Our third party advertising partner(s) employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information. This information is used by TheLadders for internal use only and is not sold or rented to third parties for purposes of marketing the products or services provided by those third parties.

While We strive to protect Your Personal Information, We cannot ensure or warranty the security of any such Personal Information.

**Other Web sites**

Our Website contains links to other websites. Please note that when You click on one of these links, You are entering another website over which TheLadders.com has no control and will bear no responsibility. Often these websites require You to enter Your Personal Information as You apply for a job directly with the hiring company. We encourage You to read the privacy statements on all such websites as their policies may differ from ours.

**Legal Disclaimer**

We may disclose Your Personal Information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on TheLadders.com.

As such, We cannot ensure that Your Personal Information will not be disclosed to third parties.
