Cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that some websites transfer to your computer, through your web browser, for record-keeping purposes. Use of cookies makes web-surfing easier by performing certain functions such as saving your passwords and your preferences regarding use of the particular website. Cookies also allow us to track your activities at our Site and provide you with personalized display advertising. To opt out of this advertising, [click here](http://dtmc.theladders.com/adinfo/adchoices_fpc_gen.html?cid=2675&cname=Ladders&cmagic=a8aa68&clogo=the_ladders.png). 

Third Party Cookies. We may also engage third parties to track and analyze Site data. We use the data collected by such third parties to help us administer and improve the quality of the Site and to analyze Site usage. Such third parties may combine the information that we provide about you with other information that they have collected. This Policy does not cover such third parties' use of the data. 

Disabling Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The "Help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. If you disable cookies, however, our Site will not function properly. 

Clear GIFs. We and our third party service providers and third party advertising partner(s) may clear gifs (a.k.a. pixel tags/Web Beacons/Web Bugs). Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of website users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on webpages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We may use clear GIFs, in connection with our Site, to among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage.

To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose "[Website Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html)" and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.

We do not share your personal information with these third parties. 

**Third-Party Ad Networks**

We use third parties such as network advertisers to display advertisements on our Sites or other websites. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Site as well as other websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Site and our services, as well as aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Site and users of our service. 

You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA").

Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you. It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Site or other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you later erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available on NAI's and DAA's respective websites.
