Congrats To Don King's PR Ace Alan Hopper!

I was honored to receive the BWAA's "Good Guy" award on June 12. My favorite recollection of any Boxing Writers Association of America Awards Dinner was in 2001 when I was arranging to bring Fighter of the Year Felix "Tito" Trinidad and his father Papa Trinidad, who had been named Trainer of the Year, to accept their awards in New York. My boss Don King was staying at another hotel and was running late, so I called to ask him if I could save some time by bringing Tito and Papa to the ceremony. Don berated me on the phone: "You will do no such thing, Alan. Under no circumstances are you to go anywhere with my fighter!" I jumped in and said, "I was just thinking it might help..." when he cut me off and said, "Stop thinking, Alan, and don't try to help," before he hung up on me. Imagine my dismay and then my surprise when he phoned back three minutes later, and his disposition had completely changed. In fact, he chuckled when spoke. "You know, Alan, I've been thinking about it, and you're the only person I could trust to take my fighter to the awards dinner," he said. "As a matter of fact, if I don't make it on time, go ahead and introduce them yourself." Not only was I in shock, but everyone at the dinner was confused when Don's PR man got up and introduced Tito and Papa to accept two of the highest honors in boxing. Later that night, we learned what Don had been up to. He was in the process of signing the hottest boxer in the world, Hasim Rahman, the man who had just shocked the world by knocking out Lennox Lewis to become heavyweight champion of the world. Only in America! (photo courtesy of Tom Casino, thanks Tom)
