In addition, the collected personal information allows us to notify our clients and other Site users of products and services that we think may be of interest.

We use third party companies to place cookies on your computer to collect non-personally identifiable information to compile aggregated statistics for us about visitors to our site.

Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.

## Protection of Rights

Security

The personal information that clients provide to The Search Agency is stored on servers, which are located in secured facilities with restricted access, and protected by protocols and procedures designed to ensure the security of such information. In addition, all of The Search Agency's personnel who have access to such information are trained in the maintenance and security of such information, and we limit access of such information by our employees to the information reasonably required in order to provide prompt, high quality service. However, no server, computer network or system, or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect user information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or through our Site, and you provide such information to us and engage in such transmissions at your own risk. Once we receive a transmission from you, we will endeavor to maintain its security on our server.

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number, national ID and personal health information) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
