CONTESTS AND GIVEAWAYS

Both the The Roar newsletters and websites contain links to other sites. The Roar is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information directly collected by The Roar.

FACEBOOK  
If you use one of our Facebook applications, The Roar may collect your Facebook name as part of the automated process.

SECURITY  
The Roar takes every precaution to protect usersâ€™ information. Access to your personal information is limited to people who need it to do their job.

NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES  
The Roar reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify or otherwise alter these terms and conditions at any time. Such changes and/or modifications shall become effective immediately upon the posting thereof. Please review the [terms and conditions](http://www.theroar.com.au/terms-and-conditions/) periodically.
