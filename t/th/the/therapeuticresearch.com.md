Not all features of the Services will function as intended if you reject cookies. 

**How do we protect your information?**

We will take reasonable precautions to protect Personal Data in our possession from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Data. 

  * Our website(s) are scanned on a regular basis for security holes and known vulnerabilities. All sensitive information you supply (such as credit card numbers, licensing information, and employee identification numbers) is encrypted during transmission via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. 
  * All payment card transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers. Please review the gateway provider’s privacy policy for additional details on our provider’s safeguards.



No method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee absolute security. You acknowledge that: (a) the limitations of the Internet are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity, and privacy of information and data exchanged between you and us cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party. TRC has no responsibility or liability for the security of information transmitted via the Internet. If you have any questions about security, you can contact us at [privacyofficer@trchealthcare.com](mailto:privacyofficer@pletter.com).

**What about links to other websites?**

Occasionally, at our discretion, we may link to third-party websites. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our Products and Services and welcome any feedback about these sites. We rely on a gateway provider, for example, to process your payments. 

**18 or under; no use by children**

The Products and Services are not intended for users younger than 18. We do not knowingly collect contact information from children under the age of 18. If we become aware that a visitor under the age of 18 has submitted Personal Data, we will remove his or her information from our files.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we decide to make a material change in our Privacy Policy, we will post it on this page. Your continued use of the Products and Services after the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will mean you accept these changes. In some cases, we may attempt to contact you through an email or other address you have provided, so we can give you choices about our using your information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection. If we make any material changes in our privacy practices that affect your Personal Data that is already in our possession, we will apply those changes to that older information only with your consent or as otherwise allowed by law.
