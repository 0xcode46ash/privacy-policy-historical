## Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy discloses the online privacy practices for The Green Button, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, "TGB") and applies to the information we collect through www.thegreenbutton.com (the "Site"). By accessing and/or using the Site, you are consenting to the collection, storage, and disclosure of data as described in this Privacy Policy. 

TGB reserves the right, at any time, to modify, alter, update, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy. We will post any changes to this Policy on this page so you can readily review the most current version. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the bottom of this Privacy Policy the date it was last updated. 

**Your IP Address**

An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer every time you browse the Internet. When a user requests a page from the Site, our servers log the user's current IP address. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer the Site. When you post to our forums your IP address may be displayed to other members. 

**Cookies**

The Site is developed using Active Server Pages (ASP), and we use per-session "cookies" (pieces of data your browser stores in your computer's memory at TGB’s request) to establish user sessions on our server. We use the cookies to carry information about usage from page to page through the Site. TGB does not use cookies to retrieve personal information about you from your computer. 

Most browsers are set up to accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to refuse them. If you disable cookies, your browser may experience some erratic behavior on some portions of the Site. 

**Personal Information**

When you sign up to receive updates from us via the Site, we will ask you to provide us with information, including, your name, address, email address, phone number, mailing address and membership status (“Personal Information”). 

**Use of Personal Information**

Except as provided below under “Disclosures for Legal Reasons”, we will not sell, trade or otherwise provide Personal Information to any third party other than to entities affiliated with TGB that are subject to similar restrictions as set forth in this Privacy Policy. We will use Personal Information only for the purposes of sending you updates and information regarding the Site. We may compile and provide aggregate statistics about our Site visitors to third parties, but these statistics will not include any Personal Information. 

**Use of Submission Information**

Any other information other than Personal Information we collect through the Site (including, without limitation feedback regarding the Site or any comments, ideas and suggestions you provide) is referred to in this Privacy Policy as "Submission Information." 

As described in our [Terms of Use](file:///content.aspx?file=terms.htm&pname=TermsOfUse), TGB does not accept or collect Submission Information on a confidential or proprietary basis. Consequently, we are free to use Submission Information for any purpose whatsoever. 

**Disclosures to Third Parties**

Because TGB does not accept or collect Submission Information on a confidential or proprietary basis, from time to time TGB may disclose your Submission Information to third parties, including, without limitation, our consultants, our representatives and our affiliated companies. 

**Disclosures for Legal Reasons**

TGB will also disclose Submission Information and Personal Information when it believes, in its sole discretion, that the law requires such disclosure or that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law; protect and defend the rights or property of TGB or others; or act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of the public or the users of the Site. 

**Links**

This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by TGB. Other Web sites (including those that we may link to) may have their own policies. TGB has no responsibility for or control over the information-collection practices of such third party Web sites. 

**How to Contact Us**

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please e-mail us at [admin@thegreenbutton.com](mailto:admin@thegreenbutton.com).
