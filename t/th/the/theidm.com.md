 **Keeping your financial information secure: rest assured that any credit or debit card details you provide will be processed, transmitted and stored with the utmost care and security.**

### SecureTrading

All credit and debit card payments made on this website are processed by SecureTrading, a carefully chosen payment service provider. The IDM does not store your card details on this site—this information is held only on a well-protected SecureTrading enterprise server, and all transactions are encrypted between your browser and the server. No personal or financial details are left unencrypted on a remote server, and such details are never sent by email.

Of equal importance is the security surrounding the payment system itself. Our partnership with SecureTrading allows the IDM to safely process your card payment through your bank, and to complete the transaction securely behind protected firewalls.

SecureTrading is a subscribing member to the VeriSign Secure Site programme. This gives you further assurance that:

  * VeriSign has verified the organisational name;
  * the site legitimately runs under the auspices of VeriSign;
  * all information sent to the site is encrypted if in an SSL (Secure Socket Layer) session, protecting against disclosure to third parties.



Elsewhere on the IDM website, SSL encryption is used wherever we ask you to supply payment details.

### "How will I know I'm in a secure page on this website?"

You can check if you are in a secure part of any website by looking for the 'closed padlock' symbol. (usually found in the bottom-right corner of the screen in your browser's task bar). Double-click on the padlock for details of the site's security certification. Also, when in secure areas, the address bar at the top of the browser shows the prefix 'https' (rather than just 'http').

 **The Institute is a member of the Marketing and Sustainability Steering Group in the UK.**

Environmental issues, including sustainable marketing practice, are some of the most pressing issues facing society. The IDM recognises the need for sustainable development and consumption, and is committed to improving the environmental impact of its activities.

The Institute is committed to continually improving its environmental performance, particularly in the areas set out below. We aim to achieve this by working with our members, customers, suppliers and through training and educating our employees. We shall monitor and regularly review the progress we are making with the programme of environmental initiatives that include, but are not limited to:

### Membership Cards

In 2009, the IDM transferred to environmentally-friendly membership cards. These cards are made by [oomph!™](http://www.madebyoomph.co.uk/), and are created from recycled credit cards. They can be readily recycled again. (IDM members signing up for their "Fantastic with Plastic" loyalty scheme will also earn double points.)

### Energy and water

We have implemented a number of efficiency measures to reduce our consumption of energy and water.

### Recycling

The IDM participates in the London Borough of Richmond’s _Business Recycling Programme_. The majority of our office waste is recycled through this scheme, and we are actively assessing other ways of recycling the waste that is not covered by the Borough’s programme.

### Print and paper

We have significantly reduced our use of paper through a number of measures. Recycled paper and office products are used wherever possible.

IDM promotional materials (brochures, leaflets, etc.) are printed on paper from sustainable forests and are elemental chlorine free.

### Course delegates

Some 2,000 training delegates and qualifications candidates pass through the IDM’s training suites each year. We provide recycling facilities for the use of delegates and, where possible, we offer the option to receive training manuals by CD-ROM rather than on paper.

We also source fair-trade refreshments for our delegates where possible.

### Suppliers

We take into account environmental policies when selecting suppliers, particularly those related to print, marketing services and office facilities.

### Transport

The IDM is a member of the Cycle to Work Scheme. We are also assessing a number of other ideas that will support and encourage our staff to travel to work and meetings using public transport. We encourage delegates to use public transport when they travel to our courses and events.

#### Working with other marketers

The Institute is represented on the UK’s _**Marketing and Sustainability Steering Group**_ , whose objective is "to create measurable engagement by marketers, communicators and sales personnel in support of sustainable (responsible) marketing practices."
