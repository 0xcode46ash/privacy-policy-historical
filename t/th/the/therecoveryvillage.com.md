Who Will Follow This Notice
This notice describes the information privacy practices followed by our employees, staff and
other personnel.
Your Health Information
As per 45 CFR 164.520, this Notice of Privacy Practices (the Notice) describes how medical
information about you may be used or disclosed and how you can access this information. Your
personal health record contains private and confidential information about you and your health.
Both State and Federal laws protect the confidentiality of this information. Protected Health
Information (PHI) under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
(HIPAA) includes any individually identifiable health information. PHI relates to your past,
present or future physical or mental health or condition and any related health care services.
How We May Use and Disclose Health Information About You
Below are examples of the uses and disclosures that we may make of your Protected Health
Information (PHI). These examples are not exhaustive but simply describe the uses and
disclosures that may be made.


Uses and Disclosures of PHI for Treatment, Payment and Health Care Operations
Treatment - Your PHI may be used and disclosed by your physician, counselor, our program
staff and others outside of our program that are involved in your care for the purpose of
providing, coordinating or managing your health care treatment and any related services.
Example: Your care while with us may require coordination or management from a third party,
consultation with other health care providers, or referral to another provider for health care
treatment. Additionally, we may disclose your protected health information to another physician
or health care provider who becomes involved in your care.
Payment - With your authorization, we may use and disclose PHI about you so that we can
receive payment for the treatment and services provided to you from your insurance or other
payor sources. Example: We give information about you to your health insurance so it will pay
for your services.
Healthcare Operations - We may use and share your health info to run our business, improve
your care, and contact you when necessary. This may include quality assessment activities,
employee review activities, licensing, and conducting other business activities. Examples: using
a sign-in sheet where you will be asked to sign your name and indicate your physician, counselor
or staff. We may share your PHI with third parties that perform various business activities for
us, such as a billing company. Also, we may contact you by phone to remind you of your
appointments or to provide you with additional information regarding your treatment or other
health-related benefits.
Special Rules Regarding Disclosure of Behavioral Health, Substance Abuse, and HIV-
Related Information:
For disclosures concerning protected health information relating to care for psychiatric
conditions, substance abuse or HIV-related testing and treatment, special restrictions may apply.
  • HIV Related Information: We may disclose HIV-related information as permitted or
required by State law. For example, your HIV-related information, if any, may be disclosed
without your authorization for treatment purposes, certain health oversight activities, pursuant to
a court order, or in the event of certain exposures to HIV by personnel of the company, another
person, or a known partner (if certain conditions are met).
• Minors: We will comply with State law when using or disclosing protected health information
of minors. For example, if you are an un-emancipated minor consenting to a health care service
related to HIV/AIDS, venereal disease, abortion, outpatient mental health treatment or alcohol/
drug dependence, and you have not requested that another person be treated as a personal
representative, you may have the authority to consent to the use and disclosure of your health
information.


Other Uses and Disclosures That Do Not Require Your Authorization
Required by Law. We may use or disclose your PHI to the extent that the use or disclosure is
required by law, made in compliance with the law, and limited to the relevant requirements of
the law. You will be notified, as required by law, of any such uses or disclosures. Under the law,
we must make disclosures of your PHI to you upon your request. In addition, we must make
disclosures to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services for the purpose of
investigating or determining our compliance with the requirements of the Privacy Rule.
Health Oversight. We may disclose PHI to a health oversight agency for activities authorized
by law, such as audits, investigations, and inspections. Oversight agencies seeking this
information include government agencies and organizations that provide financial assistance to
the program (such as third-party payors) and peer review organizations performing utilization
and quality control. If we disclose PHI to a health oversight agency, we will have an agreement
in place that requires the agency to safeguard the privacy of your information.
Public Health. We may use or disclose your PHI for public health activities to a public health
authority authorized by law to collect or receive such information for the purpose of preventing
or controlling disease, injury, or disability, or if directed by a public health authority, to a
government agency that is collaborating with that public health authority. In certain
circumstances outlined in the Privacy Regulations, we may disclose your PHI to a person who is
subject to the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration with respect to the reporting of
certain occurrences involving food, drugs, or other products distributed by such person. In
certain limited circumstances, we may also disclose your PHI to a person that may have been
exposed to a communicable disease or may otherwise be at risk of spreading or contracting such
disease, if such disclosure is authorized by law. For example, we may disclose PHI regarding the
fact that you have contracted a certain communicable disease to a public health authority
authorized by law to collect or receive such information.
Medical Emergencies. We may use or disclose your protected health information in a medical
emergency situation to medical personnel only. Our staff will try to provide you a copy of this
notice as soon as reasonably practicable after the resolution of the emergency.
Child Abuse or Neglect. We may disclose your PHI to a state or local agency that is authorized
by law to receive reports of child abuse or neglect. However, the information we disclose is
limited to only that information which is necessary to make the initial mandated report.
Deceased Patients. We may disclose PHI regarding deceased patients for the purpose of
determining the cause of death, in connection with laws requiring the collection of death or other
vital statistics, or permitting inquiry into the cause of death.
Research. We may disclose PHI to researchers if (a) an Institutional Review Board reviews and
approves the research and a waiver to the authorization requirement; (b) the researchers establish
protocols to ensure the privacy of your PHI; (c) the researchers agree to maintain the security of


your PHI in accordance with applicable laws and regulations; and (d) the researchers agree not to
re-disclose your protected health information except back to the company.
Criminal Activity on Program Premises/Against Program Personnel. We may disclose your
PHI to law enforcement officials if you have committed a crime on program premises or against
program personnel or its agents.
Court Order. We may disclose your PHI if a court of competent jurisdiction issues an
appropriate court order and the disclosure of PHI is explicitly permitted under Federal and State
law.
Interagency Disclosures. Limited PHI may be disclosed for the purpose of coordinating
services among government programs that provide mental health services where those programs
have entered into an interagency agreement.
Public Safety. If you are in a mental health treatment program only, we may disclose PHI to
avert a serious threat to health or safety, such as physical or mental injury being inflicted on you
or someone else.
Specialized Government Functions. If you are or have been a member of the U.S. Armed
Forces, we may disclose your PHI as required by military command authorities. We may
disclose your PHI to authorized federal officials for national security and intelligence reasons
and to the Department of State for medical suitability determinations.
Family and Friends. We may disclose health information about you to your family members or
friends if we obtain your verbal agreement to do so or if we give you an opportunity to object to
such a disclosure and you do not raise an objection. We may also disclose health information to
your family or friends if we can infer from the circumstances, based on our professional
judgment that you would not object. For example, we may assume you agree to our disclosure of
your personal health information to your spouse when you bring your spouse with you into
treatment center or while treatment is discussed. In situations where you are not capable of
giving consent (because you are not present or due to your incapacity or medical emergency), we
may, using our professional judgment, determine that a disclosure to your family member or
friend is in your best interest. In that situation, we will disclose only health information relevant
to the person’s involvement in your care.
Uses and Disclosures of PHI That Require Your Written Authorization
Other uses and disclosures of your PHI will be made only with your written authorization. You
may revoke this authorization at any time, unless the program or its staff has taken an action in
reliance on the authorization of the use or disclosure you permitted. If you revoke it, we will no
longer use or disclose protected health information about you for the reasons covered by your
written authorization, unless required to do so by law. You should understand that we are unable
to take back any disclosures we have already made with your authorization and that we are
required to retain our records of the treatment and care that we have provided to you. Examples
of when an authorization from you may be required include the following:


• Marketing: Any uses and disclosures of PHI for marketing purposes requires your signed
authorization.
• Sale of PHI: Even if permitted by law, we will not sell your protected health information
unless we receive a signed authorization from you.
• Psychotherapy Notes: A signed authorization is required for the use or disclosure of
psychotherapy notes except for use by the originator of the psychotherapy note in order to treat
you or to defend ourselves in a legal action or other proceeding.
• Uses and Disclosures Not Described in This Notice: Unless otherwise permitted by Federal
or State law, other uses and disclosures of your protected health information that are not
described in this Notice will be made only with your signed authorization.
