# The UPS Store: Privacy Policy

At Mail Boxes Etc., Inc., we recognize the importance of protecting your privacy. We adhere to the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy for the treatment, use and protection of the personal information provided to us by visitors to our web site. Please take a minute to read this Privacy Policy so that you can better understand our website information practices. If you have questions about our Privacy Policy, please contact us at [editor@mbe.com](mailto:editor@mbe.com)

Our Privacy Policy governs only information gathered by us from visitors to the Web Site. As used in our Privacy Policy, "MBE", "our" and "we" refers to Mail Boxes Etc., Inc. and any of its subsidiaries. MBE is a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Parcel Service of America, Inc. (UPS). The term "Our Affiliates," as used in the Privacy Policy, includes UPS and all subsidiaries and affiliates of UPS.

  
Personal Information Collected and How It Is Used  
Personally identifiable information is information that allows you to be identified or contacted individually. This web site does not collect any personally identifiable information from you unless you provide it.

Personally identifiable information may be collected when you complete any online form, application, survey or request for information. Therefore, if you do not wish for us to obtain your personally identifiable information, please do not submit it to us. You will be informed at the time you provide personally identifiable information whether the information is required or optional.

Below we describe how the personally identifiable information collected at each visitor interface on this web site is used by us. We do not sell or rent information collected on this web site, and do not disclose the information collected on this web site to third parties except to act upon your requests or queries as described in this section, or as described in Information Sharing and Disclosure.

From time to time, we may collect personally identifiable information other than as described below, but it will be obvious to you that we are collecting such information (e.g., through use of surveys). If we collect additional personally identifiable information in a manner that is not apparent, we will provide you with notice as described in Changes to the Privacy Policy

Domestic Franchises  
Within the U.S., we are accepting applications for The UPS StoreSM franchises only. If you are interested in becoming a domestic The UPS Store franchisee, you may complete and submit on-line forms requesting more information about franchising opportunities from us or make an on-line application for a domestic franchise. These forms require you to submit personally identifiable information such as your name, address, contact information, as well as information relevant to your ability to purchase a franchise. If you have co-applicant, similar information may be required from him or her.

International Franchises  
If you wish to pursue a franchise opportunity outside the U.S., you may complete and submit a Mail Boxes Etc. International Franchise Request Form. This form requires that you provide personally identifiable information including your name, address, contact information, and other information relevant to an assessment of your application for a Mail Boxes Etc. franchise. You will also be required to identify any corporation or partner participating in your application for a Mail Boxes Etc. franchise, and the country or countries for which you are interested in franchise opportunities.

The personally identifiable information collected from potential franchisees (and any subsequently gathered by us and our agents in acting on a submission) is used by us to assess and act upon your application to become our franchisee. In the case of domestic applications, the information may be shared with our area franchisees who render sales support and other assistance to us. In the case of international applications, if your submission indicates an interest in an individual or multiple-unit franchise, your information may be shared with our Master Franchisee for the applicable territory. In either case, the information will be used for purposes of assessing or acting on your application. MBE, its area franchisee or its Master Franchisee may contact you about franchising opportunities with us by means of mail, e-mail, or phone.

We also advertise franchise opportunities in various media, and if you have submitted personally identifiable information in response to any such advertisement by us, that information may be combined with the information you have submitted by means of this web site.

  
We invite web site visitors who may be interested in a corporate account to submit information in order to be contacted by one of our representatives. You will be required to supply personally identifiable information including your name and contact information. Other information about your business and needs are optionally requested. We use this information in order to contact you with information on the corporate account services which may be useful to you.

  
Both customers and our franchisees are invited to submit on-line customer service inquiries. You will be required to provide personally identifiable information such as your name, e-mail address, and other contact information in connection with your inquiry. This information will be used within MBE to address your customer service query. If your query requires us to contact a third party in order to address the query properly, we may disclose your personally identifiable information to this third party.

  
Web site visitors are asked to complete surveys regarding their use of and opinion of our web site. No personally identifiable information is collected from the surveys, which are used to improve the web site's design and functionality.

  
In addition to the uses outlined above, we may internally use your personally identifiable information in order to establish and verify your identity if you submit information to us, provide services and support to visitors to the web site, improve the web site and tailor it to your preferences, provide you with updates, promotions and other information about us, and maintain the security and integrity of our systems.

We may also anonymize your personally identifiable information by cleansing it of any information which might allow you to be identified or contacted, and combine this non-personally identifiable information with that of other visitors to the site. We use non-personally identifiable information for internal business purposes, such as analysis and planning by our marketing and customer service departments.   
When you visit our web site, like when you visit most other web sites, certain information is automatically logged about your visit. This information may include your IP address, which is the number assigned to your computer whenever it is connected to the Internet, your operating system, screen settings, Web browser software, and referring Web site.

We may employ third party contractors to perform functions on our behalf, which may include assisting us in processing your information. We share personally identifiable information with such contractors in order to assist us in using the data for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. These contractors are contractually required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are restricted from using the information for any purpose other than those authorized by us.

  
We may provide your personally identifiable information to government agencies as required by law or regulation.
