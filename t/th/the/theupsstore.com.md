**Personal Information Collected and How It Is Used**

Personally identifiable information is information that allows you to be identified or contacted individually.  Personally identifiable information may be collected when you complete any online form, application, survey or request for information. Therefore, if you do not wish for us to obtain your personally identifiable information, please do not submit it to us. However, if you choose not to provide us with certain personal information, we may not be able to provide you with the services that you requested.

If you are interested in becoming a The UPS Store® franchisee in the U.S., we use information that you provide to us in order to provide you with more information about franchising opportunities and to process franchise applications.  We also use information that you provide to us in order to provide you with specific services that you request, to provide you with additional services that we believe may be of interest to you and to improve our services going forward.  For instance, we may use your information in the following ways: 

  * To respond to requests for more information about The UPS Store® franchising opportunities. 
  * To respond to and process an application for a The UPS Store® franchise. 
  * To respond to requests from companies interested in hosting opportunities for non-traditional franchise sites.
  * To respond to your requests for information about Corporate Retail Solutions. 
  * To provide you with package tracking features. 
  * To process documents that you send via the Website for printing.
  * To respond to customer and franchisee inquiries. 
  * To process your registration for events offered via the Website.
  * To provide online promotions, sweepstakes and surveys.



In addition to the uses outlined above, we may use your personally identifiable information in order to establish and verify your identity if you submit information to us, provide services and support to visitors to the Website, improve the website and tailor it to your preferences, provide you with updates, promotions and other information about us, and maintain the security and integrity of our systems.

  
**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

When you visit our Website, like when you visit most other websites, certain information is automatically logged about your visit. This information may include your IP address, which is the number assigned to your computer whenever it is connected to the Internet, your operating system, screen settings, Web browser software, and referring website. It is used for system improvement and administration, security, statistical analysis purposes, and other internal business purposes.

We may also anonymize your personally identifiable information by cleansing it of any information which might allow you to be identified or contacted, and combine this non-personally identifiable information with that of other visitors to the site. We use non-personally identifiable information for internal business purposes, such as analysis and planning by our marketing and customer service departments.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

We will not license, sell, rent or share your personally identifiable information with any third party except as set forth below, to act upon your requests as detailed in Personal Information Collected and How It Is Used, or with your consent.

Contractors and Agents

We may employ third party contractors to perform functions on our behalf, which may include assisting us in processing your information. We share personally identifiable information with such contractors in order to assist us in using the data for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. These contractors are contractually required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are restricted from using the information for any purpose other than those authorized by us.

Affiliates and Franchises

We may share your personal information with our Affiliates and Franchisees to respond to your requests and provide you with requested services or offer services that may be of interest to you. Each Franchise is owned and operated independently from The UPS Store and is solely responsible for its own acts and omissions.  For example, in the case of franchise applications, the information may be shared with our area franchisees who render sales support and other assistance to us. We may also share information relating to your customer service query with Affiliates, Franchisees and other third parties in order to address the query properly.

Compliance with Law and Legal Requests

We may provide your personally identifiable information to government agencies as required by law or regulation. In addition, we may release your personally identifiable information in the unlikely event we deem release necessary to comply with the law, or to legally protect us, our Affiliates, customers or franchisees.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information

We may share non-personally identifiable information, including anonymized data derived from personally identifiable information collected from this Website with third parties or our Affiliates.

Business Transfers

In the event that all or a portion of The UPS Store, or substantially all the assets of The UPS Store, is sold to another business entity, personally identifiable information collected from the website will likely be among the assets transferred to such business entity. 

**Accessing and Deleting Your Personal Information**

If at any time you wish to access your information in order to update, modify or delete it, or if you wish to receive no further communication or promotional materials from us, please contact us at the address or phone number listed below. After receiving your request, we will make all reasonable efforts to make the appropriate changes to our database.  However, certain archival information may be difficult or impossible to locate and/or remove.
