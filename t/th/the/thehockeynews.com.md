**GATHERING OF INFORMATION**

**Optional Registration**  
Thehockeynews.com.com offers free, voluntary registration to users. By registering, users can enter the site without having to log on each time; users who register will have complete access to all content and resources on the site; and users who register receive the best available subscription offer at our website. During registration the user is required to supply a username, password and email address, and must answer mandatory survey questions about age, gender, income, Internet connection, zip code, country, employment status, and other employment information.

**Electronic Newsletters  
**The Hockey News offers newsletters to users. The Hockey News gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription management page or by unsubscribing. Users can also subscribe to the newsletters at the time of registration.

**Surveys**  
Occasionally The Hockey News conducts user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our advertisers and partners. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited and to allow easy access to restricted areas of the website. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. The Hockey News uses cookies to simplify access to restricted areas and to track user traffic in aggregate.

If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie.

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use Thehockeynews.com

**Use of the Information  
**The Hockey News uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.

As stated above, The Hockey News uses information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to move seamlessly through the website. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (daily or weekly, depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing.

We use tracking information to determine which areas our site users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. The Hockey News does not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.

The Hockey News creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because The Hockey News doesn't track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser will never know that a specific user clicked their ad.

The Hockey News does allow select advertisers to mail promotions to registrants and newsletter recipients who have given us their permission to do so. All promotions are pre-approved by The Hockey News and all mailings are conducted by a reputable third party mail house to ensure the names are not mis-used or used more than once. Our users are asked at the time when their information is collected if they would prefer to not receive promotions from our partners. You may change this designation at anytime.
