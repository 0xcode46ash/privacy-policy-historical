As part of the operation of this website (the “Website”), PRG Parking Management, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company d/b/a The Parking Spot gathers certain types of information about users of this Website.  This policy describes the types of information gathered, what is done with it, and how to correct or change the information.

1.         **_The Information Collected_.**  The Parking Spot collects two types of personally identifying information from users who use this Website:  personal information (such as names and e-mail addresses) and aggregated information (such as information about how many users log into this Website on a daily basis, and other information about traffic patterns on this Website).

(a)        Personal information is collected when users voluntarily provide personal information to The Parking Spot, such as when they make parking reservations, join The Spot Club or manage their Spot Club account, request answers to specific questions, respond to surveys, or register for contests and other promotional opportunities which may be provided by The Parking Spot from time to time.

(b)        The Parking Spot may use various methods to collect aggregated user information, such as information as to which pages users access or visit, and aggregations of information volunteered by users such as survey information and/or site registrations.  For example, when you click on this Website, our servers log your IP address, which is a number automatically assigned to your computer or a group of computers by your Internet service provider.

The Parking Spot uses “cookies” to collect certain information while respecting your privacy.  A “cookie” is a small data file that many websites write to your hard drive for recordkeeping purposes when you visit the websites.  Cookies allow The Parking Spot to measure activity on the Website and to improve your enjoyment of the Website by, for example, remembering your viewing preferences and, if you registered for The Spot Club, your password.  The Parking Spot does not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally written to your hard drive by The Parking Spot.  The Parking Spot does not use any information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes or share such information with any third parties, other than information that you voluntarily provided to The Parking Spot as described above.  You may occasionally get cookies from third parties who may advertise on the Website, which is customary in the Internet industry.  Since The Parking Spot does not control these cookies, these cookies are not subject to The Parking Spot’s privacy policies.  Most web browsers are initially set to accept cookies; if you prefer, you can set your web browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent.  However, it is possible that some parts of this Website will not function properly if your web browser is set to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. 

2.         **_Use of Information Collected by The Parking Spot_.**  The Parking Spot uses both the personal and aggregated information that it collects for various purposes.  The information is used to improve the content of this Website, to customize the content and/or layout of this Website for each user, and to notify users about updates to this Website or promotional offers or opportunities that we believe would be of interest.  Each time that The Parking Spot uses this information to send you a notice, you will be given the opportunity to elect not to receive any further notices from The Parking Spot, simply by following the simple procedure described in the notice.  The Parking Spot may use IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to provide aggregated data to advertisers about the volume of use on this Website.  The Parking Spot may share aggregated information with some third parties for both advertising and promotional purposes.  The Parking Spot may share personal information with third parties for marketing or promotional purposes.  The Parking Spot may disclose personal information, when it believes in good faith that such disclosure is legally required, to protect its rights or the safety of others.  If you object to The Parking Spot’s use of any personal information which you may provide for any reason, you may stop such use by modifying your registration information.  To change or delete your registration information, provide specific information in an e-mail sent to The Parking Spot via this Website’s “Contact Us” feature.

3.         **_Children and Privacy_.**  The Parking Spot encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children on-line, so as to be fully familiar with the websites visited by their children.  At various places on this Website, for example in requesting personal information, The Parking Spot may ask whether the user is under a specified age, and if so The Parking Spot may ask for parental consent.  In each such case, The Parking Spot relies on users to be truthful in responding to these questions and providing such consent.  In no event should any information be submitted to or posted on this Website by users under the age of 16.  Users under the age of 18 are requested not to participate in contests or other promotional opportunities.  Users who are 16 or 17 years old are requested not to submit or post information to this Website without the consent of their parent or guardian.  The Parking Spot may collect information, including personally identifying information, from users who are 16 or 17 years old and who submit or post information to this Website with the consent of their parent or guardian.   This information may be used for marketing and promotional purposes and may be shared with third parties.  If a user or his or her parent or guardian changes his or her mind with respect to such use, such user, parent or guardian may stop such use, either by an e-mail sent to The Parking Spot via the Website’s “Contact Us” feature or by modifying his or her registration information on-line.  Finally, it is important to note that this Website contains links to other websites, and that those websites may not follow the same privacy policies as The Parking Spot.  These websites may send their own cookies to your hard drive, and may collect information and make use of such information in ways that The Parking Spot would not. 

4.         **_Miscellaneous Provisions_.**  The Parking Spot reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time without notice.  This Privacy Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.  If any provision hereof shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this Privacy Policy, and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions hereof.  The rights granted to you hereunder are personal to you and are not subject to transfer or assignment.  Any claim relating to this Website or its use shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Illinois, and by your use of this Website you submit yourself to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.
