  * How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.



### Information Collection, Use, and Sharing

I am the sole owner of this website. I only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give me via e-mail or other direct contact from you. I will not expose, sell or rent this information to anyone – ever!

I will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted me. I will not share your information with any third party outside of my organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request(s).

Unless you ask me not to, I may contact you via e-mail in the future to tell you about new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.

### Your Access to and Control Over Information

You may opt out of any future contacts from me at any time. You can do the following at any time by contacting me via the e-mail address or phone number given on my website:

### Security

I take precautions to protect your information. You will notice that that my site is secured (https) and the green padlock is in the locked position in you browser’s location bar. When you submit sensitive information via my website, your information is protected both online and offline.

All information is encrypted and transmitted to me in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon in your Web browser, or looking for “https” at the beginning of the address of all pages on my website.

While I use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, I also protect your information off line. I am the only person with access to your information. The computers/servers in which I store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment and are password protected.
