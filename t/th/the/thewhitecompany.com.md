The Information We Need and How We Use It   
When you order with us, we ask for information such as your name, e-mail address and credit and debit card details.

All this is necessary to process your request or notify you of acceptance of your order.

For the purposes of staff training and to ensure we offer excellent customer service all calls to us are recorded and monitored. 

**Safety and Security Of Your Information**   
Our site uses secure server software to protect your information whenever you place an order or access your account information. This software encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us to minimise the risk of this being intercepted before it is received by us.
