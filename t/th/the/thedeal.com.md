# TheDeal.com - Privacy Policy

**Registration:** When you register to receive certain services from the Web site, such as personalization, you are required to supply a unique User ID and password, your full name, e-mail address, and certain demographic and professional information (for example, whether you are an investment banker and what corporation you work for). Customers who register must agree to the Terms and Conditions of Use for the Web site. 

**Premium Services:** In the event you wish to subscribe to any premium content on the Web site, you must provide contact information and, in some cases, credit card information in order for us to bill you for these optional services. All other areas of the Web site are offered free of charge. 

**Anonymous Information:** The Web site may also gather anonymous information that may be used by The Deal or shared with third parties. While this information does not personally identify you, it may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer. Generally this information is collected through traffic data reports and may entail the use of "cookies," "IP addresses," or other numeric codes used to identify a computer and/or a computer user. 

**Cookies:** A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. The only personally identifiable information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser, and you can also set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies. To enhance your experience, the Web site employs cookies to recognize you and to simplify your access privileges on our site, as well as to track site usage. Subscribers who do not accept cookies from the Web site cannot access many areas of the Web site. For detailed information or questions regarding our use of cookies, please contact us by sending e-mail to [privacy@thedeal.com](mailto:privacy@thedeal.com). 

The Web site uses advertising servers developed by third parties to display ads. Some of these ads may contain cookies that are set by third parties (i.e., advertising agencies or advertising clients). While the Web site may have access to many of these cookies, and any information that they may contain, the Web site does not share any such cookies or information with third parties.

**IP Addresses and Log Files:** The Web site also logs IP addresses for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. (Your IP address indicates the location of your computer on the Internet.) The Web site does not log IP addresses to track your session, nor does it link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable.

**Credit Card Information:** If you use a credit card to pay for a subscription on the Web site, your account will continue to be charged for the length of the subscription term or until you cancel. If you give The Deal your credit card information on the Web site for any other purpose, or to pay for any other type of purchase, it will be used one time only, to fulfill one order. The Web site will not store your credit card information.

**What does the Web site do with the information it gathers and/or tracks?**

**Statistical Analyses and Banner Advertising:** The Deal may perform statistical analyses of user behavior to measure interest in the various areas of the Web site (for product-development purposes) and to inform advertisers how many consumers have seen or clicked their advertising banners. The Deal also uses demographic information to allow advertising banners on the Web site to be targeted, in aggregate, to the readers for whom they are most pertinent. This means that readers see the advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to the people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer's experience and the effectiveness of the ads. In this statistical analyses and banner advertisement targeting, The Deal will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form. 

**E-mail:** Using the e-mail addresses provided at registration, the Web site periodically sends promotional e-mail to its subscribers about services offered by the Web site and its advertisers. The Deal may contact you regarding account status, changes to the subscriber agreement and/or to confirm registration.

Occasionally, The Deal shares data collected about subscribers with other units within the The Deal group of companies or third parties whose products or services we feel may be of interest to you. Many of our subscribers find these mail or e-mail promotions valuable, whether they are shopping for merchandise, taking advantage of a special offer, or purchasing unique services. You will only receive these e-mail promotions if you have "opted in," in other words, stated explicitly that you want to receive them during the registration process.

**How does the Web site protect its content and user information?**

**Data Security:** The Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect online, including encryption security for credit card submissions. 

**With whom does the Web site share the information it gathers and/or tracks?**  
The Deal shares the information it gathers, in aggregate form, with advertisers and other partners. The Deal does not release personal information about you as an individual to third parties, except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as if you are purchasing goods or services from the third party through the Web site. 

**What are the privacy guidelines for **TheDeal.com** community areas?**

**Discussion Groups:** The Web site offers a variety of discussion groups, chat areas, bulletin boards, and message boards ("Boards"). While it is intended that these Boards be used by corporate executives, bankers, lawyers and other professionals, the Boards are freely accessible to anyone. These guidelines do not cover the transfer of information in this context. Any information you disclose when posting a message in the Boards becomes public. Moreover, users who post a message in the Boards make their e-mail address available to others, which could result in unsolicited e-mail from other users or third parties. You should always be careful when distributing your personal information in this manner. 

If you choose to participate in or post messages on the Web site's Boards, the Web site will collect such information about you as you choose to disclose. If you use a third-party service co-branded by The Deal, the third-party service provider may provide information about you to The Deal. If you send The Deal personal correspondence, such as e-mails or letters, or if other users or third parties send correspondence to The Deal about your activities or postings on the Web site, The Deal may collect such information into a file specific to you.

**Board Usage and management.** The Boards are intended for use by deal practitioners (deal advisers, financial intermediaries, entrepreneurs, corporations and institutional investors). The Boards are not for use by consumers seeking financial, business or legal advice. The Boards may only be used for non-commercial purposes. You may not post any material concerning promotion, advertising or solicitation for goods or services.

Frequently, the Boards may be monitored by The Deal staff to maintain professional decorum and to prevent prohibited uses of the Boards. The Deal reserves the right to remove any material, message or discussion thread that is, in the sole judgment of The Deal, inappropriate. 

**Are the services of the Web site available to minors?**  
Children are not eligible to use the Web site's services, and we ask that minors not submit any personal information to us. If you are under 18 years of age, you may use this service only with the participation of a parent or guardian.
