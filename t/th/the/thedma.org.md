**Cookies**

**_All visitors_** – we place cookies on all Web site visitor hard drives to collect aggregate information on the number of visitors to our site and the number of pages viewed.

**_Registered visitors_** – we place unique identifier cookies on the hard drives of those who sign on which are used to maintain the visitor "sign on" status for the duration of the visit, for one-time customizing/tailoring of your visit and for long-term storage of user preferences. We also use cookies to track the pages visited by a visitor so that we can deliver DMA Web content based on the visitor's profile (as provided by the visitor) and the visitor's past activity on the DMA Web site.

It is used in aggregate for traffic analysis and to provide relevant information to our visitors. It is also used for Web site and system administration, including research and development, user analysis and business decision-making.

### For Web site visitors who do not make purchases or otherwise identify themselves…

If you do not sign on to our Web site, our Web server does not have access to personally identifiable information about you. It does not know your e-mail address unless you volunteer it.
