All content published in The Daily Bell by High Alert Capital Partners Inc., including the Terms of Use agreement, was originally written in English. In the event any translated version of this agreement conflicts with this English version, this English version controls.

High Alert Capital Partners Inc. considers privacy of paramount importance to liberty and thus implements rigorous security in safeguarding our readers' information. We are committed to keeping your information secure.

**Your Information:** The Daily Bell collects only the personal information from you that you voluntarily provide, which may include your name, email, mailing address, billing information, phone number, etc. Such personal information, including credit card numbers, will only be requested for purposes of completing financial purchases or conference registration transactions. The order itself will be protected via a secure connection and you will only be asked for information essential to placing the order itself.

High Alert Capital Partners Inc. will not sell your personal information to anyone, though it is possible a law enforcement agency may obtain it via proper legal steps (which does not include your mailing address).

**Mailing Address:** Once we have received your mailing address, we may use it to send you products or suggest services. If you do not want to receive such information, please let our customer service department know via [CustomerService@TheDailyBell.com](mailto:CustomerService@TheDailyBell.com).

**Email:** Your email address may be used to send you information, especially publishing or subscription information, and sometimes advertisements. However, except for these purposes, we will not sell, rent or otherwise share your email address with anyone. If this is not satisfactory, you may remove your address from our database simply by following instructions at the end of every email we send. We do not send unsolicited email. If you believe we may have done so in error, please let us know via [CustomerService@TheDailyBell.com](mailto:CustomerService@TheDailyBell.com).

**Cookies:** A cookie is a small data file containing information, such as a user's login name, that is written to the user's hard drive by a web server and used to track the pages visited. Cookies are placed on your computer via a web page you've visited. The Daily Bell uses cookies for statistical purposes but it is not our purpose to collect information that would be identifiable as yours.

**Security:** We limit access to personal information about you to those employees whom we determine need access to that information to provide products and services to you. However, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our servers, nor can we guarantee that information that users supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet.

**Third-Party Websites:** The Daily Bell links to some third-party websites, including social networking sites. We are not responsible for either the accuracy of information those sites may provide nor for security of your information at those sites, and encourage readers to review the privacy policy of such third-party sites before providing any information.
