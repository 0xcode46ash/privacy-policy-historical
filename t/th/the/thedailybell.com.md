**Guarding Your Privacy

 _The Story of the  
Appenzell Bear_

**

The symbol of the black bear comes from a 500-year-old Appenzell tradition which upholds the values of power, courage, might and virility. It is no wonder the upright bear with flashing red claws is central to the Appenzell flag and coat of arms. 

It represents the contrarian who stands alone, if necessary, to protect what is his and defend his rights as an individual. 

It also reflects our reverence for personal responsibility and free-market principles. And in keeping with those principles, we accept the duty to protect your personal information. 

Sincerely,  
  
Meinrad Mueller,  
Chairman, ARBP
