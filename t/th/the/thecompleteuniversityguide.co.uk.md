## IP addresses and cookies

We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.

For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer.

### **What is a cookie?  
**

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites you visit. They are simple text files which can be read using the Notebook program. When you visit a site that uses cookies for the first time, a cookie is downloaded onto your computer. The next time you visit that site, your computer checks to see if it has a cookie that is relevant (that is, one containing the site name) and sends the information contained in that cookie back to the site.

The site then ’knows’ that you have been there before, and in some cases, tailors what pops up on screen to take account of that fact. For instance, it can be helpful to vary content according to whether this is your first ever visit to a site or not.

Complete University Guide puts cookies onto your computer to make your interaction with our website smother. We collect information about how you browse the website and remember your preferences. Cookies also provide us with information on the number of website visits, pages viewed, how long people stayed on the website or how they accessed our website. This helps us improve our site.

We also use targeting cookies to deliver interest-based advertising on behalf of universities and partners. This helps us to keep our service to you free. These cookies record your visit to our website, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make our website and the advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests. We may also share this statistical information with third parties, such as universities.
