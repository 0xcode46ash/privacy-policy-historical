Please read this policy carefully before you use the site.

It is very important to us that you should be able to use and enjoy the website without your privacy being compromised in any way. Please read the following to understand how your personal information will be treated.

We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 500 men aged under 30 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day). We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in SW1). We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.

We will not sell, rent, trade, share, reveal or disclose any of your personal information, unless:

  * you have specifically requested that we do so;
  * we deem it necessary to provide you with services you have requested (for example, we share your personal information when you make an enquiry to a course provider through our website – we pass on your contact details to the course provider so that they can contact you directly);
  * we are required to do so by a Court of competent jurisdiction or by a governmental order, decree, regulation or rule of any regulatory agency;
  * our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/terms-and-conditions/ "Terms and Conditions") state that we will;
  * we reasonably believe that use of disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to an individual's life, health or safety or a serious threat to public health or safety; or
  * we have reason to suspect that unlawful activity has been, is being or may be engaged in and the use or disclosure of your personal information is a necessary part of our investigation of the matter or in reporting our concerns to relevant persons or authorities.



We may provide aggregate information and statistics about [www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk](https://web.archive.org/ "Home") users, traffic patterns, and related site information to third parties, but these statistics will not include individual personal information.

Some of our products are hosted by third parties but we agree with those third parties that they will keep your information secure and not use it for other purposes.

If you sign up for services that are managed or offered by other organizations, they will obtain your information.

A number of other people's web sites have links on our site. If you link to their sites, they may collect information. Such sites are not within our control and are not covered by this privacy statement.

### Disclosure of personal information

In many circumstances we will not disclose personal data without your consent unless required by law. 

Complete University Guide is owned by Hotcourses Limited. Hotcourses Limited is the principal company and the Data Controller in the Hotcourses Group of companies (Hotcourses India PVT, Hotcourses Pty Ltd (Australia), Hotcourses Inc (North America) and Complete University Guide). We may share your personal information with organisations that are part of the same group as the data controller as those companies may provide services to you over our websites.). To ensure your details are protected to the same level as in United Kingdom, we have put agreements in place to ensure these companies comply with the Hotcourses Privacy Policy and the Data Protection Act 1998. 

Another instance when we may share your personal information is when you make an enquiry to a course provider though our website – we pass on your contact details to the course provider so that they can contact you directly.

### IP Addresses and Cookies

We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.

For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer.

#### **What is a Cookie?  
**

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer browser from a website's computer and is stored on your computer's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other websites. Many websites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows.

#### What Type of Cookies Do We Use?

We use the following cookies:

  * Strictly necessary cookies. These are cookies that are required for the operation of our website. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our website, use a shopping cart or make use of e-billing services.
  * Analytical/performance cookies. They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.
  * Functionality cookies. These are used to recognise you when you return to our website. This enables us to personalise our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).
  * Targeting cookies. These cookies record your visit to our website, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make our website and the advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties, such as universities during clearing, for this purpose.



#### How Can Cookies be Managed/Blocked?

Users have the opportunity to set their devices to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these means that certain personalised features cannot then be provided to that user and accordingly they may not be able to take full advantage of all of the website's features. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. Alternatively, you may wish to visit <http://www.aboutcookies.org/>, which contains comprehensive information on how to do this on a wide variety of desktop browsers.

During the course of any visit to our site, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your computer. Our site uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our site. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our site and also allows us to improve our site.

#### Third Party Cookies

Please note that third parties (including, for example, advertising networks and providers of external services like web traffic analysis services) may also use cookies, over which we have no control. These cookies are likely to be analytical/performance cookies or targeting cookies.

To find out which third party cookies are stored on your computer and possibly to remove them, please visit <http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/> to opt out.

#### Where We Store Your Personal Data

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.

Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
