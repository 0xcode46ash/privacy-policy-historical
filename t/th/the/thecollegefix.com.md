You retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in Content, which you may submit, post or display through http://www.thecollegefix.com.

Below is our privacy policy, which incorporates these goals.

The College Fix operates a website at http://www.thecollegefix.com. It is The College Fix’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.

**Website Visitors**  
Like most website operators, The College Fix collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. The College Fix’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how The College Fix’s visitors use its website. From time to time, The College Fix may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

The College Fix also collects potentially personally identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. The College Fix does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally identifying information, as described below.

**Children and Privacy**  
Thecollegefix.com is intended for use by individuals over the age of 18. If you are under 18, please do not submit any personally identifiable information on our site. Children should always ask a parent or guardian for permission to send any personal information online to anyone.

Thecollegefix.com’s mission is to investigative and spotlight the radical views found on America’s college campuses. As such, the subject nature of many news stories and commentary featured on thecollegefix.com may involve sensitive subjects like race, religion, and human sexuality. As such, thecollegefix.com is not intended for use by children under the age of 18, unless under the supervision of a parent and guardian.

Certain visitors to The College Fix’s websites choose to interact with The College Fix in ways that require The College Fix to gather personally identifying information.

The College Fix does not disclose personally identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
