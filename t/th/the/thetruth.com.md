# Privacy Policy – thetruth.com

### Here comes a lot of legal mumbo jumbo. So, even if you’re bored to tears, read it and then check out the rest of our site.

This is a website of the American Legacy Foundation (“Legacy”), which is dedicated to creating a world where young people reject tobacco and anyone can quit. We respect your privacy and have created this policy to explain what information we collect and how we use it. If you have any questions about this policy, please contact us at info@thetruth.com.

We automatically collect aggregate information about our site’s users, including the domain name and IP address of visitors, the browser and operating system used, and the date and time of each visit. This information does not identify individual visitors, and it is used for our own research purposes and to improve the site’s content, structure, and security. We share this information only with our vendors, who use it for the same purposes.

When you visit our site, we may send one or more cookies to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies for several purposes. For example, if you are a registered user, cookies allow the server to know that you are allowed to access information or perform operations restricted to logged-in users. We use the information we learn from cookies to improve the quality of our service, for example, by tracking user trends. We share this information only with our vendors, who use it for the same purposes.  
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some of our features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.
