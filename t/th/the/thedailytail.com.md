# Privacy Policy

Last updated: June 10, 2012

Taildom is a website and service operated by The Daily Tail, Inc., a Massachusetts Coropration. The Daily Tail and Taildom take your privacy very seriously. We are providing this privacy policy to inform you of our policies and procedures to collect, use and disclose information on the Taildom service (hereafter referred to as "Taildom"), as well as your choices regarding information. If you have any questions or concerns, please let us know by clicking [here](https://web.archive.org/contact "Contact us").

This policy may be modified from time to time at our sole discretion, so check back frequently. We will notify you of any changes to the policy by posting the new policy and updating the "last modified" date at the top of the Taildom privacy policy page.

The terms "using" and "processing" information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way. This includes, but is not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization.

### How we collect information

We collect information when you browse Taildom. Tools like cookies and log files collect certain information about your activity on Taildom (see more details below).

We collect information that you voluntarily provide us to become a user of Taildom, and when you use certain capabilities of Taildom (such as when you provide your email on a form to send Taildom a message).

We collect information when you register to join Taildom through Facebook, Yahoo or Google. For instance, you may create a Taildom user account and may login to Taildom using your Facebook account. If you are not registered as a Taildom user and you click on "Login with Facebook," you will be asked to enter your Facebook login and password, and then will be given the option to create a Taildom user account. Your Facebook password will not be stored in Taildom servers. The same applies to other third-party login websites such as Google and Yahoo.

### What information we collect and how we use it

#### Personal Information

When you register as a Taildom user, you will be prompted to login to Taildom through Facebook, Google or Yahoo. If you do not have an account with any of those websites, you will not be able to login to Taildom.

When you login to Taildom through Facebook, Google or Yahoo, you will be prompted to authorize these websites to provide us with some information about you that you have already provided them before – your personal Information – which may be your name, gender and email, depending on the website you choose to login to Taildom. The information we collect may depend on the privacy settings you have with Facebook, Google or Yahoo, so please consult their privacy and data practices.

Once you have established a Taildom account for you, you may enter more personal information about you on your Taildom profile page. Your personal information may include, but is not limited to, your name, gender, profile photo, date of birth, location, your personal website and email address. We use your personal information -- in some cases, in conjunction with your non-personally identifiable information (see below) -- to provide our service to you.

#### Ways we use your Personal Information

We ask for your personal information so that we can identify you, create an account for you and contact you.

We use your personal information to create your Taildom user account, so you can use Taildom; to answer any questions or messages that you send us; and to contact you. We may send you Taildom newsletters, marketing and/or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive communications from us, follow the unsubscribe link provided in any of the communications.

#### Non-Personally Identifiable Information

We also collect other information that you provide as part of your registration and your use of Taildom (including personalization of your profile on Taildom) that cannot reasonably be used to identify or contact you (for example, without limitation, age and type of pets you own), which we call non-personally identifiable information. We may combine your personal information with non-personally identifiable information and aggregate it with information collected from other Taildom users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of Taildom and to analyze and understand how users use Taildom.

#### Log Files

As in most websites, we automatically gather certain information in log files, whether you visit Taildom as a registered user or as a non-registered user. These log files may include information such as the webpage you were visiting before you arrived at Taildom, the web browser you were using, search requests you make on Taildom, what pages of Taildom you visited, how much time you spent on those pages, among other statistics. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, administer Taildom, track users' navigation habits on Taildom and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

#### Cookies

Like many websites, Taildom uses small text files called cookies that are stored on a user's computer to store information. We use persistent cookies, which stay in your computer for an extended period of time, to save your login information for future logins to Taildom, making easier for you to use Taildom. We may use session ID cookies, which expire when you close your web browser, to enable certain features of Taildom, to better understand how you interact with Taildom and to monitor how users use Taildom as a whole. You can change your browser settings to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use Taildom or some capabilities of the service.

### How your information is shared

#### With other Taildom users

When you register at Taildom and submit personal information to enhance your profile or create posts, other Taildom users will see at least your name. Taildom users will automatically see your name if you login to Taildom via Google or Yahoo; and will automatically see your name, profile picture and gender if you log in to Taildom via Facebook. You will be able to change this information once you are registered at Taildom. If you choose to add more of your personal information on your Taildom profile page, Taildom users will see such personal information, including, but not limited to, your profile picture, location, personal website, your pets and information related to your pets. We recommend you to guard and refrain from disclosing at Taildom any information you consider sensitive and confidential. Providing additional personal information on your Taildom profile page is voluntary and should be compatible with the degree of interaction you want to have with other Taildom users.

#### Aggregate Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information

We may share aggregated information that does not include personal information and we may otherwise disclose non-personally identifiable information and log files with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your personal information.

#### With Service Providers

We may hire service providers and third party companies to facilitate Taildom, to provide Taildom services on our behalf, to perform service-related services (such as, but not limited to, maintenance, database management, web analytics and improvement of services) or to assist us in analyzing how Taildom is used. These third parties have access to your personal information only to perform these tasks on Taildom's behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

#### With Login Websites (Facebook, Google, Yahoo)

We may share the information in your Taildom user account, including your personal information, with the websites you choose to login to Taildom -- Facebook, Yahoo and/or Google. These websites will access your personal information through Taildom only to log you in to Taildom.

#### With Facebook Community

Taildom allows you to link your Facebook account to Taildom. When you are logged in to Taildom via Facebook, you have the option to post recent activity on Taildom back to your Facebook account (your Facebook wall or timeline). You may choose to post your activity on Taildom back to your Facebook wall at any time by clicking on checkbox next to the Facebook logo at the bottom of every Taildom post draft (shown in a popup box). The default setting is always to not publish your Taildom activity on your Facebook wall. You will have to click on the corresponding checkbox every time you would like to share your Taildom posts on your Facebook wall.

 **Please note that even if you delete or remove all your user content from Taildom, or if you terminate your Taildom user account, Taildom is not able to delete or remove user content you posted to Facebook using the checkbox method described above. Therefore, as soon as you post such user content via Taildom to Facebook, we have no obligation and no means to remove such content. It is your obligation to access Facebook and delete whatever content you posted via Taildom.**

#### With Government, Law Enforcement Officials, Others

Taildom may disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. In addition, your personally identifiable information may be transferred if Taildom is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets.

### Your choices regarding information

You have several choices regarding the use of information on Taildom:

#### Email Communications

If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive email communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.

#### Cookies

If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to accept cookies from Taildom for any of the purposes described above, you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. Consult your browser's technical information. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use Taildom or all its capabilities.

#### Changing or Deleting Your Information

You may review, update or correct your personal information in your Taildom account by editing your profile. You may delete your account at any time by contacting us [here](https://web.archive.org/contact "Contact us"). If you delete all of your personal information, your Taildom account may become deactivated. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes, and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request.

#### Links to other websites and services

The fact that we may link to a website or online service is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. If you visit a third party website via Taildom, you should read that website's privacy policy before providing any personally identifiable information or using their services.

### How we store and protect information

Your privacy is very important to us. We use generally accepted safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of information that Taildom collects and maintains. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us or guarantee that information on Taildom may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by unauthorized persons.

Identity theft and phishing are of great concern to Taildom, and safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We will never request your login password, your credit card information, or any national identification numbers. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission website [here](http://www.ftc.gov/ "FTC").

We will make any legally required notifications of security breaches, breaches affecting confidentiality, or integrity of stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or visible posting on the Taildom homepage in the most expedient manner possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with the needs of law enforcement or any measures required to determine the scope of the breach and restore the integrity of the system.

Your information may be transferred and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. Wherever you are located, if you choose to provide information to us, Taildom transfers personal information to the United States and/or Canada, and processes it there. Your consent to this privacy policy and your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

### Age limit

Taildom is not directed to children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has submitted personal information to Taildom without their consent, he or she should contact us via email [here](https://web.archive.org/contact "Contact us"). If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete such information from our files.
