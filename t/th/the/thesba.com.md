Privacy Policy

Effective: October 2002

Our Commitment To Privacy

This privacy policy has been created to show the integrity of The Small Business Authority, and any subsidiaries and to inform you of our level of commitment to the privacy of customer and non-customer information. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our website. 

By participating in the Council of Better Business Bureau's BBB OnLine ® Seal Program, we have made a commitment to meet the programs' strict requirements regarding how we treat your information and have it verified by BBB OnLine. Further information about this program is available at [http://www.bbbonline.org](http://www.bbbonline.org/). 

The Information We Collect

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on The Small Business Authority website. On some pages, you can order products, make requests and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are: 

Name  
Company   
Address   
Email address   
Phone number   
Fax number   
Credit/Debit Card Information   
Domain name   


When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information such as financial information, we redirect visitors to a secure server and will notify visitors through a security icon that appears in the visitor's browser.

The Way We Use Information

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. 

We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to start a service, order a product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. 

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. We will occasionally send our customers emails regarding new features and upgrades to our services that will benefit them, and that is the extent of the "marketing" that is done to customers. We DO NOT send email to non-customers, except in cases where those email addresses are used as points-of-contact when a site is set up. We do not harvest emails nor do we do any data mining on the information we collect. 

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. With respect to cookies, we use cookies to record session information, such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart. With respect to ad servers, we do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server companies. 

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. In certain instances (e.g. domain name registrations), you are asked to submit your information yourself for the purposes of receiving information or for purchasing additional products or services that complement the services you order from The Small Business Authority. In those instances, you will be advised that you are submitting your information to a third party, and you will be given the opportunity to opt-out of providing that information (and therefore, of purchasing the product or services). 

Disclosure of Information

The Small Business Authority may disclose information including, but not limited to, information concerning You, a transmission made using our network, or a web site, in order to comply with a valid court order, subpoena, summons, discovery request, warrant, statute, regulation, or governmental request (compliance documents) properly served on The Small Business Authority or one of its affiliates. If one of the aforementioned documents and/or requests is issued, The Small Business Authority and/or its attorneys will review such documents to determine their validity prior to taking any action related thereto. You agree that The Small Business Authority may charge You a reasonable administrative fee for addressing and responding to any requests and/or any such issues related to You, Your sub-resellers and/or Your customers. The Small Business Authority assumes no obligation to inform You that Your information has been provided and in some cases The Small Business Authority may be prohibited by law from giving such notice. 

Finally, The Small Business Authority may disclose Your information or information transmitted over its network where necessary to protect The Small Business Authority and others from harm, or where such disclosure is necessary to the proper operation of The Small Business Authority system and/or infrastructure.
