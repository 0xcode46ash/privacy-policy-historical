**We neither sell nor share your information with outside companies or third parties.**

When you purchase from our online store, we collect your name, billing and shipping addresses, phone number, e-mail address, and credit card information. You provide this information so we can process and ship your order. We respect your privacy by not selling or sharing this information.

We encourage you to sign-up for our e-mailing list. These letters provide you with advanced notice of store sales, new merchandise, and other store-related events. But, of course, you have the freedom to add or remove your name from our list at any time.

**Protecting your information is our highest priority.** We have developed several safeguards to keep your information completely confidential. To proceed to checkout, you must enter your e-mail address and create a password. The checkout process itself employs Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)* technology to insure your safety.

*Secure Sockets Layer encrypts your order information and sends it to a secure server, making it impossible for that information to be decoded by a party outside of the store you shop with.

To check the security of your connection during checkout, look for the unbroken key or closed lock at the bottom of your browser window. This indicates SSL is active.

Like many other web stores, you must have both Cookies and Javascript enabled in order to use our site. A Cookie is a very small text file stored on your hard drive by your web browser. It is a unique piece of information that helps our server to identify you and cannot be read by other servers or used to deliver a virus. Please note that the cookies used by our site are not “spyware” and cannot be used to store any sensitive private information. They are required for items to be placed in our shopping cart as well as to use additional features on our website and are only stored temporarily. Javascript is also used in many different functions of the site. It is a scripting language that we use to make it more convenient for you to do things such as select and add products. Please make sure you have these features enabled when browsing our site. We respect your privacy and assure that it is safe to use both of these features when shopping at www.theshoemart.com.
