Your privacy is important to The Gear Page, and its owner, The Gear Page, LLC.

If you choose to register with The Gear Page in order to become a member, the information stored on our website is limited to the information that you supply when registering.

We sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to our Web site to help us provide better service. For example, we may keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity on The Gear Page, but we do so in ways that keep the information non-identifiable.

We collect the information mentioned in the previous paragraphs through the use of various technologies, including one called "cookies".
