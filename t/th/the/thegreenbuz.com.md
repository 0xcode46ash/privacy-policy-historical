Effective March 25th, 2009

  


### Our Commitment To Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. We do not sell or share your information to third parties in any way other than that disclosed in this policy.

  


### The Information We Collect: What information do we collect?

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted to Build It Green Concepts Inc. by you, the user. Personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) means individually identifiable information about you that we collect online, including but not limited to:

  * Name
  * Company Name
  * Address
  * Personal Demographic Information (such as income level)
  * General Company Information (such as number of employees)
  * Other relevant data



If you choose to take advantage and access certain tools or Site functionality, you may be asked to provide Personal Information.   
Transaction related data, such as credit card information, will not be stored in our database once the transaction has been processed.

_Collection of Information:_

Like many Web sites on the Internet, we automatically track certain information about you as you visit and use our Sites to help us to better understand how the Sites are used and how we can enhance your overall experience on each Site. This information may include your computer’s Internet Protocol address, the URLs and Site pages you’ve visited, the number of times you visit each Site page, what downloads and/or search queries you have made, how long you spent on particular sections of each Site and on each Site generally, and your browser type. This automatically gathered data includes information provided through the use of "cookies" (which is described in more detail below).

_Information from Cookies:_

Cookies are small files that we send to and store on your computer so that we can recognize it as a unique machine the next time you visit the Sites. You are always free to decline any cookies we use if your browser permits. Some of our advertisers and third-party service providers may also utilize their own cookies.

  


### Information Sharing: How do we use Information?

Build It Green Concepts, Inc. only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of  Build It Green Concepts, Inc. in the following limited circumstances:

  * Due to Build It Green Concepts, Inc. unique free download business model, we may share aggregated, personal information about our users (such as, but not limited to the number of users who downloaded a particular plan in a particular demographic, income level, age group, etc.) with our Product Vendor Sponsors.
  * We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any directly identifying information (such as name, address, e-mail, etc.) to any vendor or third party.
  * We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Build It Green Concepts., Inc., its users or the public as required or permitted by law.



Due to Build It Green Concepts, Inc. unique free download business model, we may share aggregated, non-personal information about our users (such as the number of users who downloaded a particular plan) with our Product Vendor Sponsors. Build It Green Concepts, Inc. does not ever distribute directly identifying information (such as name, address, e-mail, etc.) to any vendor, unless the user has actively chosen to have their information sent to a specific vendor as part of the Build It Green Concepts, Inc. download process (such as a mortgage broker, or specific manufacturer).

From time to time, portions of the Sites may enable you to send email to us or to third parties and to participate in public bulletin boards and discussion groups. All postings to public bulletin boards and discussion groups become our property. Whenever you choose to initiate these kinds of communication with us, or anyone else, you may be contacted in return. Also, remember that our bulletin boards and discussion groups are open to the public, and therefore, your postings can be seen by anyone and are not protected by us or any other entity. Please use your own discretion when deciding what to post and whom to contact. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to edit or delete inappropriate postings from our bulletin boards and discussion groups. This reservation of rights shall not under any circumstances obligate us to conduct such edits or deletions, nor shall it cause us to be liable for any such edits or deletions.

If you use our "tell a friend" service to email one of our articles, reports or product descriptions to a friend or colleague, Build It Green Concepts, Inc. will automatically send this person a one-time email, attaching to the email the content you wished for your friend to receive. Your email address will appear on the "From" line of this email, thereby disclosing this information to whoever opens and reads the email. The email address of you or your friend or colleague will not be stored in our databases based on this “tell a friend” service.

You may choose not to receive direct marketing offers - sent by postal mail, telephone and/or e-mail – from Build It Green Concepts, Inc. These preferences apply to all marketing offers from us and from companies working for us. Direct marketing offers from us may include information about products and services we believe may be of interest to you. If you choose not to hear from us, you may not learn about beneficial offers.

If you elect not to receive direct marketing offers by postal mail, telephone and/or e-mail, please note that we may continue to contact you as necessary to service your account and for other non-marketing purposes. You may also be contacted from your client relationship manager or assigned account representative if applicable. Bank of America may also continue to provide marketing information in your regular account mailings and statements, including online and ATM communications.

Each customer may opt out of each direct marketing option individually. Since marketing programs may already be in progress, it may take up to twelve weeks in some situations for your opt out to be fully effective in some situations.

_Outside Links_

Be aware that our Sites link to other Web sites that may collect personally identifiable information about you. This Privacy Policy only applies to the Sites, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content for any linked Web sites. You should refer to the privacy policies and statements of other Web sites or contact the respective Webmasters of those Web sites to obtain information regarding their information collection, use and disclosure policies.

Build It Green Concepts, Inc. is committed to protecting the information you provide us. There may be occurrences where we may use other companies and individuals to perform supporting functions for the various tools, functionality, products and services offered through Build It Green Concepts, Inc. on our behalf. These service providers will not be permitted to use the information collected from you for any purpose other than performing the support functions for Build It Green Concepts, Inc.

This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date first written above and may be updated and modified from time to time by us in our sole discretion. If we choose to update or modify this Privacy Policy, such updated or modified policy shall become effective five (5) business days after its posting on the applicable Site(s). Accordingly, we encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy and the Sites in order to keep apprised of our current privacy practices. If you do not agree to any provision of this Privacy Policy, or any update or modification thereto, please do not use the Sites.
