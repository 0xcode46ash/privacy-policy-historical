### When High School Cube Discloses Information

High School Cube may share your personally identifiable information with your High School. High School Cube does not share your personally identifiable information with other organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your prior express consent.

Please be aware, however, that any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to display on any publicly available portion of the High School Cube Platform becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others without restriction.

High School Cube may disclose “System Information” and other aggregate non-personally identifiable information with interested third parties to assist such parties in understanding the usage and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, or other functionality of High School Cube.

### Advertisers

High School Cube may allow advertisers, third party advertising networks and advertising serving companies to serve advertisements directly to you. By serving these advertisements directly to you, these companies can set their own cookies on your computer and trigger their own Web beacons to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. High School Cube does not provide your personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent.

High School Cube uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to High School Cube, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, High School Cube makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our managerial, physical or technical safeguards.

If High School Cube learns of a security breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. High School Cube may post a notice on the High School Cube Platform if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach you should notify us at [service@highschoolcube.com](mailto:service@highschoolcube.com).
