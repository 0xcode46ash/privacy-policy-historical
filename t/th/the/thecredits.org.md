**INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT DIRECTLY FROM YOU**  
You may choose to submit information including Personal Information (as defined below) directly to us. For example, you may submit information through any website operated by the MPAA, including [www.thecredits.org](http://www.thecredits.org/ "The Credits") (the “ **MPAA Site** ”, and together with any other sites, the “ **Sites** ”), via various means such as registration forms, forms where you may report copyright infringements, or when you otherwise communicate with us.

  
**INFORMATION WE MAY OBTAIN ABOUT YOU FROM OTHER SOURCES**  
We may obtain information from various sources that identifies you directly or indirectly (“ **Personal Information** ”) as well as information that does not identify you. Sources from which we may obtain information include our members and their affiliates, content protection organizations, data brokers, individuals and anonymous sources, third party service providers, public registers, law enforcement authorities and the Internet.

  
**COOKIES, WEB BEACONS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES**  
Together with our third party service providers, we also may use a variety of technologies that collect certain web site usage information when you access or view any of the Sites.

(i) Cookies. A cookie is a data file placed on a computer or other device when it is used to visit any of the Sites. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including to track user preferences and web pages visited while using any of the Sites. You may disable cookies using your browser’s preferences, but some features of the Sites may not function properly or may operate slowly if you disable the cookies.

(ii) Web Beacons. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, for example, to count visitors to the Sites, to monitor how users navigate the Sites, to count how many e-mails from the MPAA were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.

(iii) Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Sites, such as which links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Sites, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

Information collected through these technologies may be non-identifying or may be associated with you as an individual. We may use such non-identifying information for any purpose. If such information is associated with you as an individual, it will be treated as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.

  
**HOW WE MAY USE PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
We may use Personal Information:

(a) to communicate with you, respond to your inquiries and process any of your requests for e-mails, newsletters or other information, including verifying that your e-mail address is active and valid;  
(b) to facilitate your participation in any online features on any of the Sites;  
(c) to perform internal activities (for example, to administer our organization, to conduct research or to generally enhance user experience on the Sites);  
(d) to enforce the Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy, or to meet any legal obligations;  
(e) to protect or defend the rights, privacy, property, safety or security of any individual or entity, including the MPAA or third parties;  
(f) to investigate, report, prevent or take action to protect against copyright infringement, fraud or other suspected unlawful activity; and  
(g) for other reasons described in the Privacy Policy or disclosed to you at the time you provide the information.

  
**HOW AND WHEN WE SHARE INFORMATION**  
We do not sell or share Personal Information we collect about you, except as described below or otherwise in this Privacy Policy.

(i) Third Parties Providing Services on our Behalf. We may use third parties to perform certain services on our behalf. We may provide these service providers with access to information, including Personal Information, to carry out the services they are performing. We do not authorize these service providers to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform certain services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. We require these service providers by contract to appropriately safeguard the privacy and security of Personal Information they process on our behalf.

(ii) Administrative and Legal Reasons. We may share information, including Personal Information, with our affiliates and offices, our members and their affiliates, content protection organizations, law enforcement agencies or government authorities and other third parties: (a) in the event we are required to respond to subpoenas or other legal process or if in our good faith opinion such disclosure is required by law, (b) at the request of government authorities, (c) to enforce the Terms of Use of the Sites or the Privacy Policy, (d) to protect or defend the rights, privacy, property, safety or security of any individual or entity, including the MPAA, its affiliates and offices, our members and their affiliates or third parties, or (e) to investigate, report, prevent or take action to protect against copyright infringement, fraud or other suspected unlawful activity.

(iii) Change in Ownership or Corporate Structure. We reserve the right to disclose and transfer all information, including Personal Information (a) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Sites; or (b) in connection with a merger, consolidation, restructuring or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process. Should such an event occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use Personal Information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Policy. Following such an event, you should contact the entity to which we transferred your Personal Information with any inquiries concerning the processing of that information.

  
**YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES**  
You may have certain rights regarding the Personal Information we maintain about you. We offer you certain choices about what Personal Information we collect from you, how we use that information, and how we communicate with you.

You may elect not to have a unique cookie identification number assigned to your computer to avoid aggregation and analysis of data collected on our websites. Most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of all features of the Sites.

If you are located in the European Economic Area (“ **EEA** ”) or Switzerland, you may instruct us not to share your Personal Information with third parties, except (i) with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf, (ii) in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets, (iii) if disclosure is required by law or legal process, (iv) with law enforcement authorities or other government authorities, or (v) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to investigate, report, prevent or take action to protect against copyright infringement, fraud or other suspected unlawful activity. Subject to applicable law, you may have the right to request access to and receive information about the Personal Information we maintain about you, to update and correct inaccuracies in your Personal Information, and to have your Personal Information blocked or deleted, if appropriate. The right to access Personal Information may be limited in some circumstances by local law requirements.

You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of such Personal Information or other information that you provide to us, and for correcting or updating any Personal Information or other information you have provided to us.

  
**LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEB SITES**  
Our Sites contain links to other web sites that we do not own, including those operated by our members and content protection organizations, (“ **Third Party Sites** ”) whose information and privacy practices may be different than ours. We have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected on or through, such Third Party Sites, and we are not responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for the information or privacy practices employed by any Third Party Sites. We encourage you to note when you leave any of our Sites and to read the privacy policies and terms of use of all Third Party Sites before using such sites or submitting any Personal Information or any other information on or through such Third Party Sites.

  
**DATA SECURITY**  
We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect Personal Information you provide against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.

While we have taken steps to protect the Personal Information we collect from you on or through any of our Sites, you should note that no Internet, wireless or mobile phone transmission is ever completely secure. In particular, unencrypted e-mail and web traffic are subject to potential interception by unauthorized third parties.

  
**DATA TRANSFERS**  
We may transfer the Personal Information we collect about you to countries other than the country in which the information was originally collected. The laws in those countries may not provide the same level of data protection as the country in which you initially provided the information.

If you are located in the EEA or Switzerland we will comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of Personal Information to countries outside of the EEA or Switzerland. The MPAA is certified under the Safe Harbor privacy framework created by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the European Commission and Switzerland for transfers of Personal Information from the EEA or Switzerland to the U.S. Click here to view our Safe Harbor Privacy Policy [www.mpaa.org/safe-harbor](http://www.mpaa.org/safe-harbor).
