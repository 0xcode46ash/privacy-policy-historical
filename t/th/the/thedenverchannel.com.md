**Privacy Notice**  
This site is owned by McGraw-Hill Broadcasting and powered by Internet Broadcasting (IB). Collectively, we respect your privacy and have developed this Privacy Notice to inform customers about the privacy practices used on this website. In addition to this Privacy Notice, The McGraw-Hill Companies, McGraw-Hill Broadcasting's parent company, has developed a comprehensive privacy policy. For more information about The McGraw-Hill Companies' Customer Privacy Policy, visit our Web site at <http://www.mcgraw-hill.com/privacy.html>. 

This Privacy Notice may be revised from time to time, to reflect changes in our business, the law or technology. If we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify our users by posting a notice on our site. 

**Are you an E-mail Subscriber?**  
If you would like to unsubscribe from an e-mail newsletter or alert [click here](https://web.archive.org/emailnewsletters/).  
If you have e-mail subscription questions, try our [FAQ page](https://web.archive.org/station/3932645/detail.html). **Note: Do not use any of the e-mail addresses on this page to unsubscribe. The respondents are not able to process those requests.

**Information Collection and Use**  
We collect user contact information (like name and email address) and user demographic information (like gender or age) from website visitors who: 

  * Register for certain products or services on-line;
  * Agree to participate in on-line surveys;
  * Wish to make certain on-line information requests from us; or
  * Wish to participate in on-line contests and promotions sponsored by us



When visitors register on our websites, we will use the demographic information collected to tailor the visitors' experiences at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying content according to their preferences. The contact information we collect will be used to contact visitors when visitors have expressed interest in being contacted, and visitors can opt-out of receiving future mailings by complying with the choice/output requirements noted below. 

When you register for a contest, contact information will be used to notify contest winners and award prizes and, in some instances may be shared with the contest or survey sponsor. Anonymous survey information will be used for purposes of reporting survey results and monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users' personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website. We track and record IP addresses that access our site for reporting and profiling purposes. We also gather anonymous browsing habits of our visitors to better identify content preferences. 

Because participation in these activities is completely voluntary, website visitors may choose not to participate in these activities if they do not want their information used in the manner disclosed through this privacy notice. Website visitors' personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties vendors unless we give prior notice and choice. 

If a website visitor elects to use our referral service to inform a friend about our site or to send an e-card through our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. IB will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site or send an e-card, as the case may be. IB stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. The friend may contact security@ibsys.com to request the removal of this information from our database.

This site contains links to other sites. This site is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. Occasionally when linking to another site, you may still see our site's logo or frame. This is to provide you with a seamless experience when visiting our website. In these cases you are no longer on a McGraw-Hill Broadcasting web site and are now on a different website whose information collection practices may differ from ours. The privacy policy of the site you are on will govern how information collected from you is used.

This site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its website visitors. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. McGraw-Hill Broadcasting and IB cannot accept any responsibility for ensuring the privacy of information that you choose to disclose in these areas.

This site is generally not targeted to children. If we learn that we have received personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, we will take steps to delete such information or to obtain verifiable parental consent. We may also share personally identifiable user information with governmental authorities when legally required to do so, and to cooperate with such authorities investigating claims of illegal activity such as (but not limited to) illegal transfer of copyrighted material, or user website postings or email messages that contain threats of violence. We may also disclose personally identifiable information in other cases where we have reason to believe that disclosure is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use.
