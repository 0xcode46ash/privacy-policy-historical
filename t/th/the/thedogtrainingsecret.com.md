## Customer Information

We may from time to time sell or rent our subscriber list or customer information to any other entities when those entities have something to offer that we feel our customers may be interested in. We only do this if we feel a 3rd party product or service is worth recommending to you. Customer information such as name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, fax number and billing information is collected for the purpose of providing services to our customers and notifying them of improvements to our products and services, or with free training advice that we feel can better help our clients and subscribers have a more obedient dog.

From time to time, we will send special offers and promotional notices via mail, e-mail, fax, and/or voice broadcast to our customers and to prospects who have expressed interest and have requested such information. At any time, customers may “opt-out” of such offers and notifications by following the opt-out link on the specific offer received, or by contacting us at support@thedogtrainingsecrets.com

TheDogTrainingSecret.com cannot guarantee that by simply watching our free videos that your dog will immeadiately start behaving, as this depends on too many outside circumstances beyond our control, including time you are willing to commit and your ability to apply what you learn, and the unique and possibly unpredictable characteristics of your dog. We do gaurantee that if our methods do not work for you we will refund you if you ask.
