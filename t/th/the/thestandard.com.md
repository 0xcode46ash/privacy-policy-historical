#### Ad Serving Technology

IDG.net has contracted with DoubleClick to serve all advertising on www.idg.net both on the Web site itself and through our e-mail newsletters. When DoubleClick is serving ads to the user, it is also using cookies to track certain types of non-personally identifiable information such as a user's IP address, his or her browser version or type, operating system, service provider, and his or her local time. For more details about the non-personally identifiable information DoubleClick collects and the opportunity to opt out of such data collection, please visit: [www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy/](http://www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy/). Although DoubleClick does share with IDG.net non-personally identifiable information such as user profiles based on click-stream profile data, such information is strictly in the aggregate. Any pages the users calls up on IDG.net will not be connected with personally-identifiable information collected either at IDG.net or elsewhere. 

#### What information does IDG.net collect and how is it used?

IDG.net collects optional data supplied by visitors to our web site through registration, surveys, sweepstakes and/or contests, as well as information that we gather from visitors via our server log. This information enables us to better tailor our content to your interests, and to help our advertisers better understand the audience they are reaching. Our site is completely free, and is supported by paid advertisements and it is therefore critically important for us to be able to identify our audience. Information is only shared with advertisers or any other third parties in aggregate form. We are also firmly committed to identifying whether information presented on our sites is written by our editorial staff or is contributed by a user or vendor. 

#### IP Addresses

For each visitor to our site, our web server automatically records the visitor's domain and IP address. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site.

#### How is our registration data used? 

Some optional services that IDG.net offers require registration. Our site's registration process requests that users give us contact information (like their name and email address), unique identifiers for authentication, and demographic information that pertains to their profession such as business industry and job function. We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user relevant information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners, but only to those who opt to receive it. These messages are delivered by us, and we never allow email addresses or other contact information out of our control. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary, for the administration of prizes, rewards, or to respond to customer service requests. We also use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. This information is only shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. Unique identifiers such as passwords, are collected to verify the user's identity and for use as account numbers in our database. This site contains links to other sites and IDG.net is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

#### Surveys

We occasionally run surveys that are optional to participate in. We only ask participants for contact information (like their email address) and demographic information that pertains to their profession or professional interests. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary, or for the delivery of prizes or rewards. Users may opt-out of receiving future survey mailings; please see the choice/opt-out section below. The survey data is only used in aggregate form and may be used to guide our editorial process or site development process. 

#### Partner Sites

IDG.net has several partners that produce IDG.net branded services for us. Information that is shared with or collected at partner sites is used to provide the services that the user selects at that site. Communication by our partners with IDG.net customers is limited to the services that our customers select. For example, if a customer requests to be notified when information on a selected topic becomes available, the partner site may contact our customers. Customers are given the option to discontinue services at any time. Additionally a user name and password may be shared with partner sites for the purpose of logging a customer in to an IDG.net service hosted in another domain. If desired, customers may choose to exclude the sharing of this information during the registration process, or by modifying their profile and service selections.

#### Public Forums

This site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

#### Security

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. These hardened security systems include firewalls, authenticated access to internal databases, and audit of regular procedures. 

#### Choice/Opt-Out

IDG.net gives visitors the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us, at the point we request information from you.
