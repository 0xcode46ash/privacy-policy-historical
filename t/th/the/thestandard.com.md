# The Industry Standard: Internet Economy news and analysis for business leaders: Privacy Policy

Below is the current policy regarding the usage of data collected by TheStandard.com. We reevaluate this policy on an ongoing basis based on feedback from readers. 

**Visitor Data**

For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically records the consumer's domain name and IP address. We collect only the domain name of visitors to our web page, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, and information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations. We do not collect e-mail addresses of unregistered visitors. Cookies may be used to collect information. 

The aggregated information we collect is used for the following purposes: 

1\. to improve the content of our Web pages 

2\. shared with advertisers and potential advertisers to help them assess TheStandard.com's suitability for their ad campaigns 

3\. set by our audit bureau to verify our claims of traffic to the site 

In regards to cookies, TheStandard.com's ad-serving partner, Double-Click, records cookies in cookie files only to prevent repetitious ad banner placements. If you do not want the frequency of ad exposure controlled, you can deny this feature by following instructions at: 

<http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/opt-out.asp?asp_object_1>=&.

**Registered User Data**

Registered users are asked to complete a questionnaire with identifying information and demographic information. The information we collect on registered users is used in the following ways: 

1\. to improve the content of our Web pages 

2\. used to notify users via e-mail newsletters about updates to our Web site 

3\. used by us for marketing TheStandard.com products and services 

4\. used by our audit bureau to verify cumulative demographic statistics 

5\. if the user has given permission, names and addresses may be shared with other reputable organizations (including IDG sister companies) for marketing purposes 

6\. used by TheStandard.com, IDG, and IDC for research surveys 

7\. used by Editorial for consultation with readers 

Telephone numbers of registered users will not be rented to outside firms for sales purposes. TheStandard.com may use the telephone numbers for surveys or editorial consultation with users, and may allow outside firms to use them for surveys. IDG Sister publications may be allowed to use TheStandard.com subscribers' phone numbers to promote free subscriptions. 

Currently, E-mail and postal mail addresses may be used by TheStandard.com to promote TheStandard.com and IDG products and services, surveys, and for editorial consultations with users. 

We allow each registered user to "opt out" of receiving e-mail and postal mail from outside firms and IDG sister companies at the time of registration. When the user has given permission, his e-mail address may be rented to outside firms for promotional purposes. Offers for which the names are rented are screened, and renters are required to target their offers carefully. Users who later decide they want to change their preferences may write to us at: 

TheStandard.com.com List Rentals 

501 Second Street 

San Francisco, CA 94107 

and request that their name be removed from the promotion list, or click here to unsubscribe from mailing lists. 

**TheStandard.com Partner Services Data**

TheStandard.com.com will from time to time partner with other companies to provide services to our subscribers and registered users that we feel may be valuable to them. Only in cases where you need to subscribe or register to use these services, TheStandard.com.com will share your registration information with the partner company. We share this information to provide the service to you and for better customer service. 

If any of these services are discontinued, registered users and subscribers of the service on TheStandard.com.com will be given the option to opt out of being contacted by the partner company. 

**TheStandard.com Events and Conferences**

E-mail addresses, postal addresses, fax and phone numbers will be used for notification of information pertaining to the conferences you register for or express interest in. 

Postal addresses of attendees and registrants will be used to promote other TheStandard.com and IDG products and services, and may be rented to selected outside firms for promotional purposes. When the attendee has given permission, his e-mail address may be shared with sponsors or rented to other firms for promotional purposes. Offers for which the names are rented are carefully reviewed, and renters are required to target their offers carefully.
