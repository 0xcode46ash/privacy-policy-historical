# Privacy Policy | The Canary

## What is a privacy policy?

A privacy policy outlines an organisation’s approach to ensuring privacy around its user’s stored data. This is the privacy policy for thecanary.co and for certain services provided through these and other Canary Media websites and applications (“our sites”) by Canary Media Ltd (“CML”).

At CML we collect different types of information about our users for four main reasons:

  1. To provide personalised services unique to individual users.
  2. To help us to monitor and improve the services we offer
  3. To sell advertising space on the site, the income from which is used to **[support us](http://www.thecanary.co/support-us/)** in our mission to build a new media and distributed to our writers based on **[our values](http://www.thecanary.co/values/)**.
  4. If we have permission from the user, to market services to them.



There may be other privacy policies that apply to certain services we provide. Please read these when you register or subscribe for these services on these sites.

## Our principles

  1. We do our very best to protect your privacy by using security and technology appropriately. 
    1. We ensure appropriate security measures to protect your information.
    2. We ensure another organisation have appropriate security measures when we make use of them.
  2. We fundamentally respect your privacy. You should receive emails only from us and, if you agree, from other organisations we have carefully chosen. We will always allow you to opt-out of any marketing / advertising easily.
  3. We will collect individual user details only if we have your permission or we have sensible business reasons for doing so, such as collecting enough information to manage subscriptions.
  4. We will be clear in what information about you we collect and how we use it.
  5. We will use personal information only for the purposes for which it was originally collected and we’ll make sure we delete it securely.
  6. Our site is accessible via the internet. This means that people around the world who access our website can see anything you post on the website, for example, comments about an article.
  7. If we or our service providers transfer any information out of the European Economic Area (EEA), it will only be done with the relevant protection (stated under UK law) being in place.



## How we use your information

  3. through cookies
  4. if you choose to reveal information in postings
  5. when you enter sales promotions and competitions



### Subscriber

We ask the minimum information possible to take payment for the subscription periodically as well as that required to contact you. These details are securely stored by our subscriptions provider, PayPal.

We do not use this information for any other purpose such as marketing other than to contact subscribers periodically with information relevant to their support of the organisation.

### Logging in using social networking credentials

If you log-in to our comments using a Facebook log-in, you are granting permission to Facebook to share your user details with us.

## Who we share data with

We will not share your personal information with others for marketing purposes unless you have given us your permission. If we have your permission, we will share your information only with other organisations we have chosen carefully.

We may make other organisations’ services available, through our sites, although we are not necessarily operating these sites. We process any information which we collect when you access a service provided by another organisation under this privacy policy. Information these other organisations collect is governed by their own privacy policies.

We can access and release personal information to keep to relevant laws and government requests, to operate our systems properly and to protect both us and our users.

Any other organisations who access your information in the course of providing services on our behalf will be governed by strict contractual restrictions to make sure that they protect your information and keep to data-protection and privacy laws which apply. We may also independently audit these service providers to make sure that they meet our standards. We may use service providers to help us run these sites (or services available on the sites), some of whom may be based outside the EEA.

Some of our webpages use plug-ins from other organisations (such as the ‘Facebook Like’ function). These other organisations may use information about your visit to our websites on their pages.

## About our advertising

Our sites contain links to other websites from which we may earn revenue. Our articles are never influenced by advertisers or affiliates, nor are they written for the purpose of promoting a product.

In order to deliver The Canary as a free, open and accessible publication we make use of advertising to generate revenue to cover costs and to compensate [our team](http://www.thecanary.co/team/) for the work they do. In order to provide the most relevant and highest performing advertisements we may use statistical behaviour of our visitors to identify the most valid adverts. The behavioural analysis we perform is anonymous and records preferences around articles they may read and sections they may find interesting and not who they are.

We may also share anonymised behavioural data with advertising partners. This may mean that when you are on other websites, you will be shown advertising based on your behaviour on thecanary.co. We may also show you advertising on our site based on your behaviour on other sites.

## Legal information and how to contact us

Under the UK Data Protection Act 1998 we have to say who the ‘data controller’ is for thecanary.co and services provided through our websites. The data controller is the organisation responsible for protecting information and, in our case, is Canary Media Ltd.
