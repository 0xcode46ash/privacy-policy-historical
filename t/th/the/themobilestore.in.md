**Information We Collect**

At themobilestore.in, we are committed to providing excellent customer service and outstanding value in mobile phone and accessories while respecting and protecting the privacy of our customers. To better serve you, we may collect and maintain certain information regarding, your products and service preferences, date of special occasions related to people you buy gifts for (eg., birthdays), and billing and shipping information. Under no circumstances do we sell or rent this information to other businesses, and we protect and enforce the confidentiality of this information. We respect your privacy and seek to protect the trust you place in themobilestore.in. Our Privacy Policy is explained in more detail below:

**Security**

When you place an order online, your personal information and credit card information are encrypted using SSL encryption technology before being sent over the Internet, making it virtually impossible for your information to be stolen or intercepted while being transferred to themobilestore.in. Your credit card information is always stored in encrypted form in a database that is away from our Web site database so it isn't connected to the Internet, and is therefore safe from hackers. **Kindly keep a copy of your Proof of Identity, address and credit card at the time of delivery for verification.**

 ****Cookies**

To personalize your experience at both themobilestore.in we may use a feature on your Internet browser called a cookie. Cookies are small files that your Web browser places on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to let us know that you are a prior customer and to retrieve certain information previously provided by you to us, so that you do not need to re-enter this information every time you shop at the site. Cookies also let us know how you found us (e.g., through a particular web site or advertisement). Cookies are not used to access information entered on the secure server. This information can only be accessed when you enter your name and password. If you choose to configure your browser to remove or reject themobilestore.in cookies, you will not be able to make purchases from the themobilestore.in site.

**Web Beacons**

In addition, from time to time we may contract with third party companies to help us better provide relevant products and services to you. Some of these companies use Web beacons (also known as action tags or single pixel gifs). A Web beacon is a transparent image that has been placed on a Web page and sends a signal when a user has visited that page. A Web beacon does not contain any personal information. 

**Internet Protocol**

For those individuals who visit our site but do not make a purchase, we collect and store IP ("Internet Protocol") addresses during the visit. No individualized information is collected, and the IP address is not traced to a particular individual. Similarly, we collect information, using that IP address, about the navigational or browsing activities of our visitors. Again, that information is not tied to any name or other personally identifying information but is used solely to provide generalized demographic data, such as what geographic areas our visitors are from and visitor browsing patterns. For those who make a purchase on themobilestore.in, in order to fulfill the order, we collect and store your name, address, shipping information, e-mail address, telephone number, purchase data, and billing information. 

**Use of Information Gathered**

We and the third parties who provide services related to themobilestore.in will use the information referenced above to fulfill your order and provide services related to themobilestore.in or the operation of our business. Examples of these services include payment processing and authorization, fraud protection and credit risk reduction, product customization, order fulfillment and shipping, Web site evaluation, data analysis and, where applicable, data cleansing. The third parties who provide any of these services are authorized to use this information only in connection with the services they are engaged to perform.   
In addition to using the information to fulfill your purchase order, we also retain some of that information in our customer database. We use that information to track your order, to respond to your inquiries and to make subsequent purchases you wish to make easier and faster. We also may use that information, from time to time, to contact you concerning our products, services, sales or special promotions of themobilestore.in or our corporate affiliates, including The MobileStore. We try to limit those contacts to ones that might be of interest to you. If you would prefer not to be contacted about our special offers, products or services, please notify us at the mailing address, e-mail address or phone number provided below:
