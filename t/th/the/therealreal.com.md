# Privacy | The RealReal

Effective Date: February, 2016 

The RealReal, Inc. ("The RealReal", "us", or "we") is committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of our Users. This Privacy Policy, which is part of our overall Terms of Service, covers personal information collected about our Users, which includes users of The RealReal Service (as defined in our Terms of Service), visitors to our web Site (www.therealreal.com, or "the Site"), and Consignors to The RealReal (who are subject to additional Consignment Terms). 

Please review this Privacy Policy to better understand our practices as they apply to personal information. By using The RealReal Service or accessing the Site, you consent to the data practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, or any of the terms in the Terms of Service (including the Consignment Terms if you are a Consignor), you may not continue to use The RealReal Service or visit the Site. 

## Changes to our Privacy Policy

From time to time, we may modify this Privacy Policy in our sole discretion. If we make any updates or changes to this Privacy Policy, all modifications will be posted to this Site, and will be effective immediately upon our posting. Using The RealReal Service, or using the Site, after updates are posted and effective constitutes acceptance of any changes. 

## What Personal Information Do We Collect?

We collect personal information of all Users of The RealReal (including visitors to its Site), which may include name, phone number, address, email address, and payment information. We may require you to provide personal information to interact with or register for the Site. We require you to register for the Site in order to use The RealReal Service or to act as a Consignor to The RealReal. If you participate in our opinion polls, surveys, contests, or sweepstakes, we may collect additional personal information about you in connection with your response or entry. 

Additionally, you may choose to make other personal information available to us in connection with the consignment of an item, when you submit a video or blog for publication on the Site, email us, or invite a friend to join the Site. 

## Use of Personal Information We Collect

We use the personal information we collect to provide you with information, products, and services that you request and that we believe may be of interest to you. We use the personal information that we collect to register users, process requests and orders (including membership registration), communicate with you, provide you with other services, offers, and updates, as well as to administer our Site and comply with applicable laws. 

### Communicating with You

We may communicate with you about topics we believe you may be interested in, including through newsletters, alerts, and reminders about recurring event sales. From time to time we may send you service-related emails, such as a welcome email when you register for the Site. 

If you provide us personal information when you communicate with us (including in person, by phone, or via email) this information may be shared with a Customer Care representative, employee, or expert that is most likely to be able to address your inquiry. This information will be used only for the purpose of responding to your inquiry. 

### Invitations

When you invite a friend to join our Site, we will automatically send your friend an email invitation on your behalf. We will not use your friend’s email address for any other purpose unless they join our Site or request further information or response from us. Similarly, when you email a message using the Invite a Friend function, we do not store the email addresses that are used to facilitate the email communication. 

### Opinion Polls and Surveys

We may share personal information we collect from your responses to opinion polls or surveys with third parties. If we do so, we will provide you with notice and the opportunity to consent. 

### Contests and Sweepstakes

If you enter a contest or sweepstakes conducted by The RealReal and/or one of our partners, we may contact you in connection with that particular contest or sweepstakes, including in order to update you regarding your status, administer the promotion, or let you know that a promotion has ended. 

### Online Tracking

Like most websites, we, our service providers, and our third-party partners may collect certain information about your interaction with our Site. This information may be stored in log files. Information stored in log files may include Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and other information. 

We collect this information through the use of cookies and other similar technologies. We use this information to analyze demographic and other trends, administer the site, track aggregate usage of the Site, and provide you with relevant advertising. 

Because an industry-standard Do-Not-Track protocol is not yet established, the choices we offer will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy independent of any Do-Not-Track signals. 

Your Privacy Choices, and right to control our use of your personal information, are described below. 

## Sharing of Personal Information

### Third Parties

We may provide contractors access to your personal information in the course of assisting in operating our business and providing products or services to you. These contractors include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services and/or content for the operation and maintenance of our Site or Service. Access to your personal information by these contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary for the contractor to perform its limited function. We require our contractors to keep the personal information they are provided confidential and to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

We will not rent, sell or share your personal information with third parties without your consent except to provide you with a product or service you request or as described in this Privacy Policy. 

### Legal Disclaimer

We may disclose personal information pursuant to a request from law enforcement or pursuant to other legal or regulatory process, or as otherwise required by law, or, in our sole discretion, to protect our rights, property or interests, including to enforce this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service. In the event that we are legally compelled to disclose your personal information to a third party, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you unless doing so would violate the law or court order. 

In our sole discretion, we may also disclose information we collect to a third party when we believe it is reasonably necessary to investigate or prevent harm, fraud, abuse, or illegal conduct. 

Information collected from this site may also be transferred as part of a merger or other combination, or as part of a restructuring, bankruptcy, transfer of assets, or to our successors in interest. 

## Your Privacy Choices

### Updates to Your Information

At your request, we will make efforts to update, change or delete personal information The RealReal maintains about you. In order to enforce the terms of this Privacy Policy, resolve disputes, or provide information to satisfy applicable governmental laws, regulations, investigations or proceedings, we may need to retain your personal information in our files. 

### Choice/Opt-out

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletters, alerts, or promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications. 

### How to Exercise Your Choices

You may notify us of your choices or preferences by accessing your “Account Info” on the Site, or by contacting us as set forth in the “How to Contact Us” section below. 

## Additional Information

### Third Party Websites

This Site contains links to other websites provided by third parties. Please be aware that we do not control these third party websites or any of the content contained on those websites. Once you have left our Site, we cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage you to exercise caution and to read the privacy policy for the website you visit. The inclusion of hyperlinks to third party websites on our site in no way constitutes an endorsement by us of such websites' content, actions or policies. 

### Aggregated Information

We may share aggregated information about you with third parties. Aggregated information is non-personal information about you that is combined with the non-personal information of other users. We may not limit the third parties' use of the aggregated information. 

### Your California Privacy Rights

California's "Shine The Light" law permits California residents to annually request and obtain information free of charge about what personal information is disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. The RealReal does not distribute your personal information to outside parties for their direct marketing, except as provided for in this Privacy Policy, without your consent. 

### Access by Children or Minors

Our Site is not directed to children under the age of 13, and our Terms of Service prohibit minors from using our Site or Service. We do not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. 

### Security

We take precautions to protect information that we collect from our Users. We protect the information entrusted to us through physical, technical and administrative safeguards. These protections include restricting access to personal information to employees who need the information to perform a specific job. The RealReal provides its employees training on its security and privacy practices. 

However, no information security safeguards can be guaranteed to be completely secure, so you should use caution whenever providing personal information online, electronically or otherwise.
