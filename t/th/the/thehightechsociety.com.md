# Privacy Policy | The High Tech Society

**Privacy Policy**

At The High Tech Society we not only respect your privacy concerns, but we also understand the issues behind them. We live in a world where information is a currency, and your private data might be sold by unscrupulous web-site owners looking to make a buck. In fact, most of our writers and admins have been a victim of this sort of data transfer at one point or another. That’s one of the reasons why we respect your privacy. Not only do we promise not to share or sell your private or anonymous information with anyone in any capacity other than site analytics, or the purpose for which you have given it, but we also promise to protect your information using the highest standards of web security. The following privacy policy applies to The High Tech Society and it’s sub-domains, newsletters, social pages, and other content.

**What Information Does The Hi** **gh Tech Society Collect?**

The High Tech Society collects both personal and non-personal data.

**Personal Data  **\- We collect personal data such as email and IP addresses, your name, and other contact details when you voluntarily give it to us. This could be signing up for our newsletter, leaving a comment on one of our blog posts, liking or following one of our social pages, or sending us an email. When you do any of these things, you are voluntarily sharing your personal information. We do not use any of this data in any way except for how you intended us to use it when you sent it. So, if you send us an email, the only thing we will do with your data is reply to you. Or if you leave us a comment, we will not use your data in any way. We believe that your personal information is yours so we do not share it, or benefit in any way from it.

**Anonymous Data**  – The High Tech Society automatically collects anonymous data for analytics purposes. This includes your location, computer and browser, your IP address if this is allowed by your browser, the length of time spent on the site, which pages you visit, your ISP (Internet Service Provider), and if applicable, how you accessed the site. This is for internal purposes only and is not shared in any way.

**How Do We Protect Your Data?**

The High Tech Society uses the most recent web-security standards including Transport Layer Security, Secure File Transfer, and basic Data Encryption. In addition, any content that you give us, is protected by passwords and firewalls, so that only administrators of our website can access your data.
