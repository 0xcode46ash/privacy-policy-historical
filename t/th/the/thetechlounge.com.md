# Privacy Policy - About TheTechLounge

Privacy policy

TheTechLounge, Inc. is committed to protecting your online privacy while providing you with the most useful and enjoyable Web experience possible. While you can use many features of TheTechLounge anonymously, you are required to provide personal information to gain access to some of our premium content and services.

How we collect and use personal information

Registering for membership on TheTechLounge gives you access to all the site's information and features. The only information required is your e-mail address, which is primarily used for user authentication. With your approval, we occasionally will send e-mail to notify you about important changes to the site, new services, and special offers from us. If you would rather not receive these e-mail notifications, you can simply indicate that preference either when you register or at any time you modify your account. In addition to receiving e-mail announcements, you can also sign up for a bi-weekly e-mail newsletter.

If you enter a contest or respond to a promotion, we may ask for your postal address, e-mail address and phone number so we can notify contest winners and deliver promotional goodies.

How we use "cookies"

As you probably know, "cookies" are small pieces of information that some Web sites store on your computer's hard drive when you visit them. Like many other Web sites, TheTechLounge uses cookies to identify members so they don't have to enter a user ID and password upon each visit. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies but allow you to modify security settings so you can approve or reject cookies on a case-by-case basis. Even if you do not use cookies, you can still access all of the features on our site by logging in manually with each visit.

What we provide to third parties

While TheTechLounge does not provide any third-party access to your personal information, we may provide third parties with aggregate statistics about our customers, traffic patterns, and related site information. This data reflects site usage patterns gathered during millions of customer visits to our Web site each month, but it does not contain behavioral or identifying information about any individual member unless that member has given us permission to share that information.

Obtaining your consent

By using our Web site, you give TheTechLounge permission to collect information about the pages served to you as an anonymous user for the purpose of calculating aggregate site statistics. If you register at TheTechLounge, you authorize TheTechLounge to use information you provide to personalize the information we deliver to you and to use your demographic information when calculating aggregate customer data. As a registered member, you give TheTechLounge and our agents permission to send you e-mails related to the subscription e-mail services to which you subscribe.

If you are under the age of 18, you must not provide your name, e-mail address, or any other identifying information without the consent of your parent or guardian, or as otherwise provided for by applicable law.

Any changes to our privacy policy will be posted on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.

Tell us what you think

TheTechLounge welcomes your questions and comments about our privacy policy. Please send an e-mail to [Brian@TheTechLounge.com](mailto:brian@thetechlounge.com).
