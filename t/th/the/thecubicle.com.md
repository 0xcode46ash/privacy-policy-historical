**Privacy Policy**  
  
At theCubicle.com (the "Site"), protecting your privacy is important to us. TheCubicle.com is an online community for technology professionals, through which we provide information, online resources and a suite of Internet-based tools and services. We use information that we collect from you to personalize and improve your experience in using our Site and its various products and services, including CircuitNet™ (our proprietary suite of engineering development tools), House of Geek™ (our online store), (IC)2™ (our electronic tradeshow), Sockets™ (our electronic magazine), and Learn and Play (informational and fun areas of theCubicle.com), and to aid in communications between Aprisa and you and Site users. Please read on for more details concerning our privacy policy.  
**_What information do we collect?_**

_Automatic collection of information._ Like many Websites on the Internet, we automatically track certain information about you as you use our Site. This information may include your IP address, the URLs and Site pages you've visited, the number of times you visited each Site page, what downloads you made, how long you spent logged-on to particular sections of the Site and to the Site in general, and your browser type.  
  
_Information you enter._ We also collect information you choose to provide us through the Site or through email. For example, we obtain information when you complete our various online Registration Forms (such as the CircuitNet, (IC)2 and Sockets Registration Forms) or a feedback form, respond to a survey, enter a contest, post information on the Site, or report a problem with the Site. This information may include your name, password, email address, mailing address, job title, phone number, fax number, your primary job function, the types of design you are involved with, how many projects you are involved with in a given year and at a given time, information on your company (such as your company's name, headcount, engineering headcount, product line, annual revenue, and years in business), and credit card information. You can choose not to provide us certain personal information, but then you may not be able to obtain or use various products or services (such as CircuitNet, House of Geek, and (IC)2) or otherwise fully take advantage of the features of our Site.  
**_Who is collecting your information?_**

When you provide information through the Site, the information is stored on and transmitted through one set of servers owned by Aprisa, located at the secure facilities of our third-party Internet Service Provider ("ISP"), with a duplicate copy stored on a second set of servers in our facilities. In both locations, your information can be accessed only by authorized Aprisa personnel.  
  
We advise you that alliance partners, vendors, sponsors and advertisers of the Site that have links on the Site may also collect information about you when you visit their Websites or otherwise communicate with them. Although we encourage these parties to adopt and follow their own consumer privacy policies, we are not responsible for their use of your information. The information practices of those Websites linked to the Site are not covered by this Privacy Policy. You should refer to the privacy policies and statements of other Websites or contact the respective webmasters of those Websites to obtain information regarding their information collection, use and disclosure policies.  
**_With whom do we share your information?_**

We are not in the business of collecting user information for sale to others. We will share your personal or company identifying information only with your consent or under the following circumstances:

  * _Service providers._ We use other companies and individuals to perform supporting functions for the various products and services offered through the Site on our behalf. For example, we have third-party ecommerce and financial services providers that assist us in routing and processing your subscription to CircuitNet and purchase orders submitted through the House of Geek. These service providers are not permitted to use your information for any purpose other than performing the support functions for Aprisa.
  *  _Site vendors._ When you attend a vendor's "booth" at one of our virtual (IC)2 tradeshows, we will provide your email address to the vendor.
  *  _Protection of rights._ We will release your information if we believe that such action is appropriate to: (1) comply with legal process, (2) enforce any applicable Terms of Use Agreement for the Site (or any portion thereof), or (3) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Aprisa, its employees, other Site users or others.
  *  _Asset transfers._ Aprisa continues to develop its business and in doing so might choose to buy Websites, businesses or other assets. Customer information is generally one of the transferred assets acquired in such purchases. Also, if Aprisa should choose to sell some or all of its assets, customer information, including your information collected through this Site, could be included in the transferred assets.

  
In all other circumstances, when we disclose any of your information to a third party it is in the form of aggregated statistical data that doesn't identify you individually. This non-identifying information includes, for example, the purchasing patterns, trends, preferences, and other collective characteristics of our users and serves to help us, our alliance partners, sponsors, advertisers and others evaluate and tailor our communications, advertisements, products, services and general business practices.  
**_Control of Your Information_**

From time to time, Aprisa may provide you through email, telephone solicitations, and/or postal mail information on Aprisa or its various products or services or issues of the Sockets magazine. We provide you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving these types of communications by checking the pertinent "Opt-Out" box(es) on the Registration Form(s) you submit. Please be advised that once your information is disclosed to an (IC)2 vendor in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we do not provide a means of opting-out of any communications that vendor may send to you and we advise that you contact such a vendor directly for more information on any available opt-out procedures.  
  
**_Bulletin Boards and Chat Rooms_**

Aprisa may provide chat sessions and rooms, forums, message boards, bulletin boards and/or news groups for users to receive information about products and various topics. Please remember that any information disclosed in these areas may be viewed by other users of the Site. If you post on any of these areas, please use care not to disclose any personal or company identifying information. Aprisa is not responsible or liable for the uses that others may make of the information you post on any of these areas.  
  
**_Security_**

We use a combination of procedures and technologies to protect your information and all transmissions made through our Site. Here are some of the highlights:

  * The personal or company identifying information that you provide us is stored on servers, which are located in secured facilities with restricted access, and is firewall-protected. In addition, all Aprisa personnel who have access to such information are trained in the maintenance and security of such information, and Aprisa limits access of such information by its employees to the minimum information reasonably required in order to provide prompt, high quality service.
  * Use of the CircuitNet product has a password access feature designed to permit only you (and other authorized employees of your company, if any) and Aprisa to have direct access to your account information. In order to ensure the effectiveness of a password protection system, you must diligently maintain the confidentiality of your password(s). Aprisa will not be responsible for any unauthorized access to and resulting use of your account accomplished through the use of your valid and current password(s).

  
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our Site, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we will attempt to ensure its security on our systems.  
**_Children's privacy_**

Naturally, the safety of children is very important to us. The Site is a general audience Website and no portion of the Site is directed to children under the age of 13. We do not collect personal identifying information from any person we actually know is a child under the age of 13.  
  
**_Summary_**

At Aprisa, protecting your privacy is important to us. By accessing and using our Site, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of information by Aprisa as described in this Privacy Policy. Although this Privacy Policy is subject to change from time to time, we will notify you prior to any material change at least fifteen (15) days prior to implementation of the new Privacy Policy. If you have any questions concerning this policy please send an email to Aprisa's Managing Editor [editor@thecubicle.com.](mailto:editor@thecubicle.com)
