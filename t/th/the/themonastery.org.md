# Universal Life Church Monastery Privacy Policies

_Our church changes constantly, so we may amend this Policy from time to time - and you agree to all amendments. This Policy was last revised on October 19, 2017._

The Universal Life Church Ministries herein referred to as “the ULC”, “the Church”, “we”, and “our”) cares about the privacy of visitors (herein referred to as “you” and “yours”) to our site. We also know you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. Please read on for a full discussion/understanding of privacy policy and how we may utilize, disclose, and protect this information. By visiting our websites, you accept the practices described in this Privacy Notice and our Terms of Use. 

**1\. What Information We Collect**

There are two types of information we collect or use. One is personal information, which you give us and includes your name, email address, and physical address. It also includes certain financial information when you make a purchase, such as your credit card number. The second type is automatic, non-personal information, such as cookies, an IP address, and your browsing behavior on our sites (such as the date and time you visited, how long you spent, and the areas or pages you visited). 

**2\. How We Use Your Information**

**2.a**   In order to provide you a legal and valid ordination, we require all of our ministers to provide us with their full legal name, email address, and physical address. This information is collected to, among other things, verify your identity, populate our member records, and aid us in generating legally valid ministerial documents for you if you choose to acquire any of these from our online store. We may also use it to contact you if necessary. Your personal information is stored in our secure records. As a valid church, the law requires that we retain this information in our records. 

**2.b**   Should any of your personal information change, such as your name or address, we ask that you contact us to update your records accordingly. We have also made it possible for registered members to update their account information on the website itself by accessing the information editor located in the “My Account” section of the website once you have logged in using the email address and password you used when you became ordained/created your account. In this section, you will also be able to view your historical order information, information saved on the site for your convenience and private review. 

**2.c**   Should you ever make a purchase in our online store, we may also need to collect your credit card number, credit card expiration date, and billing address (“financial information”). The financial information is used only to process payment and fulfill your order. Your financial information will never be shared for any other purpose with outside or third parties. 

**2.d**   Automatic, non-personal information such as cookies is used to improve our products, services and operations; to detect and investigate activities that may violate our policies or be illegal; and to keep track of your use of our websites. Cookies are digital files stored on your computer, and are not stored anywhere online. These cookies may be used to deliver content specific to your interests, and they allow your computer to recall your username and password to our site in order to enable you to more easily access your site account. 

**2.e**   We also work with third party partners and tools, like Google Analytics, to make constant improvements to our online environment to ensure that it is working effectively and efficiently. As these partners and tools analyze our online performance they may have access to some of the automatic information, but will never have access to your personal or financial information. 

**3\. Disclosure And Sharing**

**3.a**   We will never sell or rent to any third party your financial information you provide to us, unless you give us consent. Nor will we use personal or financial information in ways not described in this Privacy Policy. The Church has contracted with a firm that collects responses to survey questions to ensure that we are serving our ministers as best we can. Please note that if you choose to participate in this survey, that third party firm may request that you provide them with your email address and may contact you to send additional survey questions. Our system also automatically passes your email address to the survey firm to send you followup questions after your order is placed. Once the survey email has been dispatched, the third party survey firm deletes all minister email address information. 

**3.b**   The Church offers pages on our site such as our forum and our guest book where any personal information you enter will be publicly accessible and available to third parties via public search engines offering search services. We are not liable for any harm that occurs as a result of your posting personal information in these accessible areas of the website. If a written request is made to remove any personally-identifying content in one of these areas of the site, the Church will make every effort to remove that information in a timely manner. 

**3.d**   At times, we may be required by law to disclose personal information, such as to law enforcement or by court order. By submitting your personal information you authorize us to disclose personal information to law enforcement or to comply with a proper legal order or requirement, as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate. 

**4\. Third Parties**

**4.a**   We utilize carriers, such as the US Postal Service, to fulfill orders, deliver packages and mail. We also utilize companies to process credit card payments. These third parties have access to some of your personal information needed to perform their limited functions, but are not permitted to use it for other purposes. 

**4.b**   As part of our services, our websites often contain links to third-party websites, which may have privacy policies that differ from our own. The ULC is not responsible for the content or privacy practices on those websites. We recommend that you review the privacy policy posted on any site that you may access through our websites. 

**5\. Those under the age of 13**

**5.a**   The Church does not direct its products or services to minors. Furthermore, the Church does not ordain or sell to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children, and anyone under the age of 18 may use our sites only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. 

**5.b**   By entering your personal and sensitive information as part of the ordination/registration process and clicking the submit button (as is indicated on that page) you agree that you are over the age of 13 and are authorized to do so. If we suspect than an individual has registered/become ordained on the site while under the age of 13 or using false information, we will promptly cancel the ordination and delete this information. If you suspect that an individual under the age of 13 has registered for ordination, please alert us by emailing [ help@themonastery.org](mailto:help@themonastery.org) and we will follow up appropriately 

**6\. Security & Integrity**

The security, integrity, and confidentiality of your information are important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, misuse, disclosure, and alteration by unauthorized third parties. Please be aware though that, despite our best efforts, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Any transmission of your data on or using the ULC websites is at your own risk.
