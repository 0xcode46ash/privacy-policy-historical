# The Perfect Palette: Privacy Policy

**The Perfect Palette | Privacy Policy**

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

 **Log Files**

As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. See “Third Party Advertisers.”

 **Third Party Advertisers**

Third Party ad servers or ad networks may also use cookies to track users activities on this website to measure advertisement effectiveness and for reasons that will be provided in their own privacy policies, The Perfect Palette has no access or control over these cookies that may be used by third party advertisers.

Some of the advertisements that appear on The Perfect Palette web site are delivered to you by national internet advertising and application companies such as Cox Digital Solutions. This company may utilize technologies to collect anonymous information about your visit to our site, including information about the banner ads displayed, cookies placed on your computer and/or your IP address. 

To opt out of information collection by Cox Digital Solutions, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policy, please visit their website at: http://www.coxdigitalsolutions.com/privacy-policy/consumer-opt-out-program http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp

 **Information Sharing and Disclosure**

Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)

We share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners and advertisers. This information does not identify individual users.

We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.

 **Legal Disclaimer**

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site

 **Giveaways**

We frequently offer giveaways on our website. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these giveaways is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and e-mail address, as well as shipping address should you win the giveaway), and demographic information (such as zip code). If you win the giveaway, we will email you to request your permission to pass along your email address and name to the giveaway sponsor, who will then get in touch with you to ship your prize. In this way, you do not need to send The Perfect Palette your shipping address and we do not have this information on file. Your name and email address which we do collect for entries is kept private.

 **Links to Other Sites**

This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by The Perfect Palette. Please be aware that we, The Perfect Palette, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.

We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.

 **Security**

The security of your personal information is important to us. We use PayPal for payment, which uses secure socket layer technology (SSL).

If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at chrissy@theperfectpalette.com  
  
  
**Editorial Content  **  
We try to make every effort to include proper sources and links to where we find photos for our collages. If you notice a photo that is not properly credited, we welcome you to contact us via email with that information. We will surely update that information appropriately.

Furthermore, if you're a photographer who finds a photo of yours on our site that you'd rather us not use, we'd be more than willing to take the photo down. Again, simply email us and we'll happily take it down.

 **Changes in this Privacy Statement**

This privacy policy is subject to change without notice and was last updated on November 15th, 2011. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
