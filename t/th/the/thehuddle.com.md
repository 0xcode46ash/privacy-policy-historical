Examples of this basic information include the visitor's domain name (e.g., whether the user is logged on from aol.com or earthlink.net), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to Our Sites) and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform).

We also count, track and aggregate the visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites. As a result we may merge information about visitors and visits into group data, which may then be used for internal research and analysis. We will not disclose your individual identity or personally identifiable data without your permission. When we do present aggregated information to outside companies, no one will be able to identify you or contact you.
