**Use of Cookies and Browser-Level Information**

A “cookie” is a small piece of information that a website can store in a designated file on your computer or Web-enabled device.  Cookies can be used, among other things, to identify your computer or device when you log into a website and may track your IP address in order to do so.

When you visit our websites, we use cookies to collect aggregate information on the number of visitors to our site and the number of pages viewed.  While DMA does analysis of its website logs to monitor the flow of traffic and make improvements to the site’s content, its website logs are not personally identifiable, and no attempt is made to link them to individual visitors to this site.  This information is used only by DMA and its agents or contractors and is not shared with any third-party companies.

If you register through one of our websites, we place a unique identifier cookie that is used to maintain your “sign on” status for the duration of your visit to the site, customize or tailor your visit and to store your user preferences for that site over time.  We also use cookies to track the pages visited so that we can deliver DMA Web content based on a visitor’s profile (as provided by the visitor) and the visitor’s past activity on that site.  The use of these cookies also enables our sites to “remember” the items that visitors add to their shopping carts as they browse elsewhere on the site, to alert visitors to new areas that we think might be of interest to them when they return to the site, to ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads, and to customize the Web page content based on a visitor’s browser type or other information that the visitor sends.

**Choices About Data Collection and Use**

We may allow advertisements to be placed on our websites by third-party organizations.  Those organizations may collect web-reporting data on their placed advertisements.

If you do not wish to receive information about new DMA products and services, third party offers we may send you, or upcoming events, you may opt-out of receiving promotional DMA communications by sending an email request to [customer@the-dma.org](mailto:customer@the-dma.org).  In your email, please indicate which mode(s) of communication you would like to opt-out of (postal mail, email or telephone contact). If you are visiting other Websites and see an advertisement from the DMA, there will be an opportunity to opt-out of future DMA ads on that site as managed by the third party provider through its opt-out function.

Please note that DMA members who opt-out of promotional DMA communications will continue to receive non-promotional DMA communications via email and otherwise that are provided as conditions of membership.  If you would like to opt-out of individual DMA member publications, please contact DMA Customer Service at 212.790.1500 or via email [customer@the-dma.org](mailto:customer@the-dma.org).  If you do not wish to have your information shared with third party companies as previously described, please send an email request to [customer@the-dma.org](mailto:customer@the-dma.org) indicating such.  We will be sure your name is removed from the list we share with other organizations.
