Links

** This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we theLotter.com are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

 **"Cookies"** A "cookie" is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We do not use "cookies" on this site. 

**Tell-A-Friend** If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's email address. **theLotter.com** will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. **theLotter.com** stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact **theLotter.com** at [_service@thelotter.com_](mailto:service@thelotter.com) to request the removal of this information from the database.

 **Security** This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or personal details), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry – SSL 128 bit. While on a secure page, such as your details form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL, follow this link [_http://www.verisign.com/_](http://www.verisign.com/). 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage. 

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to 

[_service@thelotter.com_](mailto:service@thelotter.com). 

**  
Site and Service Updates** We send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service such as confirmation of purchases or notification of winnings. These communications are not promotional in nature. We also communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone. 

**Alerts** We supply Alert serviced upon user request, giving e-mail alerts in case of high lottery jackpots above the level determined by the user, or e-mail lottery results alert of special lotteries chosen by the user. The alert can be chosen, edited or canceled by clicking the link "My Alerts" in the Member Zone. 

**Correction/Updating Personal Information:** If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can usually be done by logging into your account and clicking on the "My Details" link or by emailing our Customer Service at [_service@thelotter.com_](mailto:service@thelotter.com). 

**Notification of Changes** If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
