** Information Collection and Use  
  
theLotter.com** is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.  
We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. **theLotter.com** collects information from our users at several different points on our website. **Registration** In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration form.   
During registration a user is required to give his contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user in regard to services on our site, in which they expressed interest. **Order** In order to participate in lottery games, except for “theFree”, a user must provide contact information (such as name and residence) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date).  
This information is used to bill the customer for their purchase of lottery tickets, as well as pay the customer wins. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. **Subscription  
** **  
**Since theLotter covers many lotteries throughout the world, you can subscribe to a lottery game or to a category:  
 * **theBig** \- Subscription for the largest jackpot lottery in the world   
 * **theSmart** \- Subscription for the most cost efficient lottery in the world   
A Subscription to one of the lotteries or to one of these categories ensures that you will be participating in the lottery of your choice each time there is a draw, without having to remember the lottery's schedule and repeat your number selection every time.  
To Subscribe, a user has to mark the 'Subscription' option after confirming his/her bet.  
To view or to cancel a Subscription, a user has to click on _'My Subscriptions'_   in his/her account. 

**Log Files** We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. **

Links

** This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we **theLotter.com** are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

 **"Cookies"** A "cookie" is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We do not use "cookies" on this site. 

**Tell-A-Friend** If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's email address. **theLotter.com** will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. **theLotter.com** stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact **theLotter.com** at [theLotter-service@thelotter.com](mailto:theLotter-service@thelotter.com) to request the removal of this information from the database.

 **Security** This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information on the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or personal details), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry – SSL 128 bit. While on a secure page, such as your details form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL, follow this link <http://www.geotrust.com/>. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or customer service representatives) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage. 

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [theLotter-service@thelotter.com](mailto:theLotter-service@thelotter.com)

**  
Site and Service Updates** We email our users site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service such as confirmation of purchases or notification of winnings. These notifications are not promotional in nature. We also communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regard to issues relating to their account via email or phone. 

**Alerts** We supply alert services upon user request, giving email alerts in case of high lottery jackpots above the level determined by the user, or email lottery results alert of special lotteries selected by the user.  
The alert service can be selected or discontinued at any time by clicking on 'My Alerts' in a user's account. 

**Correction/Updating Personal Information:** If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data.  
This can usually be done by logging into your account and clicking on 'My Details'  or by emailing our Customer Service at [theLotter-service@thelotter.com](mailto:theLotter-service@thelotter.com). 

**Notification of Changes** If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Home page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

 **Legal Disclaimer** Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process demanded by our Web site.
