More details on saved card details can be found in our FAQs. Additionally we may also obtain information as a result of authentication or identity checks. Sometimes we may ask for your telephone number. This number may be given to our courier for delivery services. These details allow us to process your order and to let you know the status of your order.

In addition, our Live Chat provider stores all chat conversations for 13 months. These transcripts are only accessed by THE OUTNET for training purposes so we can enhance the service we provide. To receive a copy of your chat conversation simply request this when exiting Live Chat or contact our customer care team by emailing [customercare@theoutnet.com](mailto:customercare@theoutnet.com).

The use of cookies helps us to assist your use of certain aspects of the Site.You can delete cookies at any time or you can set your browser to reject or disable cookies.

      * To recognize repeat visitors for statistical/analytical purposes; or 
      * Anonymous tracking of interaction with online advertising, for example, to monitor the number of times that a banner ad is displayed and the number of times it is clicked.

We may connect the information that we collect through cookies with other Personal Information that you provide to us. Such purposes are:

  * [How personal information may be used, including anyone it might be shared with]()
    * THE OUTNET may use your Personal Information for the processing of orders, payments and to provide you with a personalized shopping experience. We will also use your details to fulfil and deliver your orders and manage your account. Personal information that you provide may be disclosed to a credit reference or fraud prevention agency, which may keep a record of that information.

If you choose to opt-out for this service, we will not send you alerts for new products, features nor enhancements; special offers; upgrade opportunities; contests or events of interest. However, if you choose to receive our emails from time-to-time we will use the information you provide to promote the products and services of our business partners or other companies within the NET-A-PORTER GROUP, via email or direct mail. We do collate information about Site traffic, sales, most wanted list, and other commercial information which we may pass on to third parties but this information does not include any information which can identify you personally. We strive to limit use of your information to those offers that we think you would appreciate receiving. Finally, we may use your Personal Information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, together with non-personal data to monitor customer patterns so we can consistently improve our site design to better meet our visitors' needs. If we change our policy on disclosure to others, we will inform you and give you the choice of opting out.

In addition to disclosures identified in the purposes above, from time to time we may disclose Personal Information to:

  * [Safeguarding your personally identifiable information]()
    * Because we are a global company, the data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the United States. Data we collect may also be processed by staff operating outside the US who work for us or for one of our suppliers or service providers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfillment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a user identification code, password or any other piece of information as a part of a registration scheme or a security procedure to enable you to access certain parts of the Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. In particular, you should not share your password with anyone who is not of legal age to enter into contracts and purchase goods in the country or other territory in which you are located or are accessing the Site or to anyone in a country or other territory where use of the Site is not permitted.

We will only collect personally identifiable information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to serve you in view of our legitimate business purposes as set out above, and we will use our best endeavors to maintain appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information you have provided us with. When you place an order or access your account information, we use a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption which encrypts your information before it is sent to us to protect it from unauthorized use. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that third party business partners to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of that personal information. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of the data you transmit to the Site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use reasonable efforts to try to prevent unauthorized access.

In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your email address, we may notify you by email. 

  * [Links]()
    * The Site may contain links or references to other websites outside of our control. Links to other websites may use our Site logo or style as a result of a co-branding agreement. These websites may send their own cookies to you and may collect data and make use of that data in ways that this Site would not. Please be aware that we have no control over these websites and our Privacy Policy does not apply to these sites. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policies and terms of use linked or referenced in the websites you enter.

As required, this Privacy Policy may be supplemented by additional legal requirements in jurisdictions where we conduct business. Nothing in this Privacy Policy or otherwise will create, or add to, any right or claim (whether legal, equitable or otherwise) that any individual or person may have at law or otherwise against the NET-A-PORTER GROUP, the company or any third party or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives; nor will the existence of this Privacy Policy or its application impose or add to any obligations or liability upon the NET-A-PORTER GROUP that the NET-A-PORTER GROUP does not already otherwise have under law.
