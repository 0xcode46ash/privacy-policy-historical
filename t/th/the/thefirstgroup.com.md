The First Group is committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology that gives you the most powerful and safe online experience. This Statement of Privacy applies to The First Group Web site and governs data collection and usage. By using The First Group website, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.

### Collection of your Personal Information                   

The First Group collects personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. The First Group also collects anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your post code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favourites.                   

There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by The First Group. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is used by The First Group for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of The First Group Web site. 

The First Group encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from The First Group so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information. The First Group is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of The First Group and The First Group family of Web sites.                   

### Use of your Personal Information                   

The First Group collects and uses your personal information to operate The First Group Web site and deliver the services you have requested. The First Group also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from The First Group and its affiliates. By completing and sending an enquiry form through this website or other The First Group websites, you are providing explicit permission to be contacted by email, sms or telephone about The First Group investment offerings and promotions. Upon initial contact, you will always be given an opportunity to opt out of future communications. The First Group may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.                   

The First Group does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. The First Group may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, The First Group may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to The First Group, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

The First Group does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent.                   

The First Group keeps track of the Web sites and pages our customers visit within The First Group site, in order to determine what First Group products and services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customised content and advertising within The First Group to customers whose behaviour indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.

The First Group web sites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on The First Group or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of The First Group; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of The First Group, or the public.
