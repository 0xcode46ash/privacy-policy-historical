**Our commitment to privacy**  
Aside from the contents of this statement, the conduct of APN Newspapers Pty Ltd is governed by the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2000 and in particular the following National Privacy Principles. 

APN Newspapers Pty Ltd subscribes to the Privacy Standards of the Australian Press Council. For more information see:

<http://www.presscouncil.org.au/pcsite/complaints/priv_stand.html>

**National Privacy Principles**

**Principle 1: Collection of information**

Personal information will only be collected to the extent necessary, by lawful and fair means, and for specified purposes which are relevant to the operations of APN Newspapers Pty Ltd.   
When personal information is collected directly from the individual to whom it relates the purpose of collection will be identified and it will only be collected with the person's consent. 

**Principle 2: Use and disclosure of information**

**Personal information will only be used for:**  
a) a purpose for which it was collected or for a reasonably expected related purpose;  
b) the derivation of anonymous or aggregated information;  
c) the prevention or lessening of a threat to the life or health of the individual concerned or another person;  
d) purposes permitted, required or authorised by or under law;  
e) the enforcement of the criminal law or of a law imposing a pecuniary penalty or for the protection of public revenue, where the use is reasonably necessary, or;  
f) any other purpose, where the person concerned has consented to its use for that purpose. 

**Personal information will not be disclosed to a third party unless:**  
a) the person concerned has consented to the disclosure;  
b) it is the usual practice of APN Newspapers Pty Ltd to pass information to a third party and the individual from whom the information was collected was notified of this practice at the time of collection;  
c) there are reasonable grounds to believe that disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a threat to the life or health of the individual concerned or another person;  
d) the disclosure is permitted, required or authorised by or under law; or  
e) the disclosure is reasonably necessary for the enforcement of the criminal law or a law imposing a pecuniary penalty, or for the protection of public revenue. 

**Principle 3: Data quality**

Prior to the use and disclosure of personal information, reasonable steps will be taken to ensure that personal information is relevant and to the extent necessary, accurate, complete and up to date for the purpose for which it is to be used. 

**Principle 4: Data security**

Reasonable steps will be taken to protect personal information we hold against misuse and loss, against unauthorised access, alteration, destruction, and disclosure and all attempts will be made to destroy or de-identify personal information if it is no longer needed. 

**Principle 5: Openness**

APN Newspapers Pty Ltd has clearly expressed policies on its management of personal information and these will continue to be readily available. APN Newspapers Pty Ltd will take reasonable steps to let individuals know, generally, what sort of personal information it holds, for what purposes, and how it collects, uses, and discloses that information. 

**Principle 6: Access and correction**

Where APN Newspapers Pty Ltd holds personal information about an individual, it will provide the individual with access to the information on request, in a form or manner suitable to the individual's reasonable needs, except to the extent that:   
a) providing access would pose a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of any individual; or  
b) providing access would have an unreasonable impact upon the privacy of other individuals; or  
c) the request for access is frivolous or vexatious; or  
d) the information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings between APN Newspapers Pty Ltd and the individual, and the information would not be accessible by the process of discovery in those proceedings; or  
e) providing access would reveal the intentions of APN Newspapers Pty Ltd in relation to negotiations with the individual in such a way as to prejudice those negotiations; or  
f) providing access would be unlawful; or  
g) denying access is specifically authorised by law; or  
h) providing access would be likely to prejudice an investigation of possible unlawful activity; or  
i) providing access would be likely to prejudice:  
(i) the prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution or punishment of criminal offences; or  
(ii) breaches of a law imposing a penalty or sanction  
(iii) the enforcement of laws relating to the confiscation of the proceeds of crime;  
(iv) the protection of the public revenue;  
(v) the prevention, detection, investigation or remedying of seriously improper conduct; or  
(v) preparation for, or conduct of, proceedings before any court or tribunal, or implementation of its orders; by or on behalf of an enforcement agency; or  
(j) an enforcement agency performing a lawful security function asks APN Newspapers Pty Ltd not to provide access on the basis that providing access would be likely to cause damage to the national security of Australia.

Where providing access would reveal evaluative information generated within APN Newspapers Pty Ltd in connection with a commercially sensitive decision-making process, APN Newspapers Pty Ltd may give the individual an explanation for the decision, rather than direct access to the information. 

Wherever direct access by the individual is impractical or inappropriate, APN Newspapers Pty Ltd and the individual should consider whether the use of mutually agreed intermediaries would allow sufficient access to meet the needs of both parties. 

If APN Newspapers Pty Ltd levies charges for providing access to personal information, those charges:  
a) will not be excessive; and  
b) will not apply to lodging a request for access. 

If APN Newspapers Pty Ltd holds personal information about an individual and the individual is able to establish that the information is not accurate, complete and up-to-date, APN Newspapers Pty Ltd will take reasonable steps to correct the information so that it is accurate, complete and up-to-date. 

If the individual and APN Newspapers Pty Ltd disagree about whether the information is accurate, complete and up-to-date, and the individual asks APN Newspapers Pty Ltd to associate with the information a statement claiming that the information is not accurate, complete or up-to-date, APN Newspapers Pty Ltd will take reasonable steps to do so. 

APN Newspapers Pty Ltd will provide reasons for denial of access or correction. 

**Principle 7: Identifiers**

APN Newspapers Pty Ltd will not adopt as its own identifier an identifier that has been assigned by a government agency (or by an agent of, or contractor to, a government agency acting in its capacity as agent or contractor). 

**Principle 8: Anonymity**

Whenever it is lawful and practicable, individuals will have the option of not identifying themselves when dealing with APN Newspapers Pty Ltd. 

**Principle 9: Transborder data flows**

APN Newspapers Pty Ltd will not transfer personal data outside Australia unless:  
(a) APN Newspapers Pty Ltd reasonably believes that the recipient of the information is subject to a statute, binding scheme or contract which effectively upholds principles for fair information handling that are substantially similar to these rules; or  
(b) the individual concerned consents to the transfer; or  
(c) the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the individual concerned and APN Newspapers Pty Ltd, or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken in respect to the individual's request; or  
(d) the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the interest of the individual concerned between APN Newspapers Pty Ltd and a third party; or  
(e) the transfer is for the benefit of the individual concerned; and  
(i) it is not practicable to obtain the consent of the subject of the information to that transfer; and  
(ii) if it were practicable to obtain such consent, the subject of the information would be likely to give it; or  
(f) APN Newspapers Pty Ltd has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the information which it has transferred will not be collected, held, used or disclosed by the recipient of the information inconsistently with these rules.
