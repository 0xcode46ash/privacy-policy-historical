# Privacy - The Darkroom

**Last Revised February 2011**

**Your Private Photo Albums, Album Sharing, and Address Book**

The Darkroom is committed to providing you with a safe and private environment to upload, share and print your photos. All of your photos are password protected and are not visible to others unless you explicitly share them. To invite visitors to see your photos, click on the “Share Photos” link and follow the instructions. The Darkroom will send an email to your list of invitees containing the URL to your album. Please note that your invitees can then forward the email containing the URL to other parties, if they choose. The Darkroom uses the email addresses provided only to facilitate your photo sharing activities and for no other purpose. The Darkroom will not use the addresses described in this section for any other purpose and will not disclose the addresses you provide to any third party.

**Your Personal Information**

The Darkroom only uses your personal information to conduct business with you. Your personally identifiable information will not be rented, sold or shared with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Statement or as otherwise agreed by you. The Darkroom may disclose information it has collected from any member of the Service and/or content any member has made available on the Service when it believes in good faith that the law or legal process requires it, or when it is necessary to do so to protect the rights or property of The Darkroom or others.

**Information You Explicitly Provide**

In order to establish your account or to place any orders for prints or other products provided through the Service, you will be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information to us, such as your name, mailing and email address, phone number, and a credit card number and expiration date. We will use that information to process and communicate with you concerning any order you may submit.

**Your Copyrights**

The Darkroom respects the intellectual property rights of others. The Darkroom claims no ownership rights in any image contained in any of your photo albums and will not share your images unless instructed by you or otherwise required by law. Please note that when you share a photo album, you allow the recipients of that album to share and make photographic prints from the images contained in that album.

**Protecting your information**

The Darkroom uses industry best practices to protect your information and your privacy. When your password or credit card number are requested on the site, we use SSL to present secure pages to protect that information. We also guarantee that every order you make at The Darkroom will be 100% safe.

**Cookies**

Cookies are pieces of information that your browser receives from Web sites and stores on your computer’s hard drive. Information in cookies includes preferences you select while visiting a particular Web site. For example, by storing cookies on your hard drive, you’ll return to a specific Web site with the same settings you used on a previous visit. The Darkroom never saves information such as your password or your credit card number on cookies. We do require cookies in order to manage and protect your The Darkroom session.

**Log files**

Our servers store IP addresses for all connections to the service. This data is analyzed in the aggregate for administration purposes and is not linked to your personal account. Occasionally, we may use the IP logs to gather information that might help Customer Support respond to an inquiry by you about your account, but will not do so without an initial action by you.

**Pixel Tags**

The Darkroom sends email messages to customers who are opted-in for such communications using a third party provider. These messages may contain pixel tags (also known as clear gifs or web beacons). These tags provide statistical information to The Darkroom so we can better understand what communications are successful.

**Legal exceptions to the rules**

Only in the case of our good-faith belief that the law requires it or, to protect your or The Darkroom rights or property, will we disclose customer information to proper law enforcement authorities even though you might have sent us an email requesting that we don’t share your information. This information may be necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against anyone who may attempt to cause injury to another’s rights or property.
