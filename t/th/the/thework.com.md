“Katie’s Work is a   
wonderful, transformative practice for anyone interested in spiritual growth.”   
**Lama Surya Das**  
author, _Awakening the Buddha Within_

**\-------**

“Good Lord! Where did Byron Katie come from? She’s the real McCoy. Her Work is amazingly effective—a simple, straightforward antidote to the suffering we unnecessarily create for ourselves. She asks us to believe nothing, but provides a surprisingly effective and simple way to cut through the tangle of delusions we wrap ourselves in.”  
**David Chadwick**  
author, _Crooked Cucumber: The Life and Zen Teaching of Shunryu Suzuki_

“Suppose you could find a simple way to embrace your life with joy, stop arguing with reality, and achieve serenity in the midst of chaos. That is what _Loving What Is_ offers. It is no less than a revolutionary way to live your life. The question is: are we brave enough to accept it?” **  
Erica Jong**
