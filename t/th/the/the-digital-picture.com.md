# The-Digital-Picture.com Privacy Policy

Our privacy policy is very simple - we will respect you as a person. We must collect enough information from you to enable us to provide the services you request. This information may include personal information such as your name, company name, address, telephone number and e-mail address as well as credit card information provided to us and a third party credit card processor. If you provide this information to us, you are agreeing to allow us to use that information to complete any transactions which you request from us. You acknowledge and agree that this information may, because of the structure of the Internet, pass through a number of jurisdictions and countries and you agree to this happening. We will not sell (or give away) any of your contact information unless you advise us to do so. Your contact information will be used by us to communicate with you regarding an order or a specific inquiry you make. We will not send unrequested mass email. We may provide opt-in selections on our contact information in the event that we someday utilize mailing lists for tips, site update notices ... We will honor your response to these questions. We utilize cookies to make our shopping cart functional and to provide you with a better experience on the site. We collect and analyze non-personal information found in our web logs (commonly referred to as web statistics). As hard as we try, we cannot guarantee security as even Microsoft with their many billions of dollars cannot.
