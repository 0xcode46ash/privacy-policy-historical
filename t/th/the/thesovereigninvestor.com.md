# Privacy - The Sovereign Investor

**PRIVACY POLICY — IMPORTANT — PLEASE READ**  
We at The Sovereign Investor take your privacy very seriously.

**e-Mail Address**  
When you subscribe to The Sovereign Investor via e-mail, your e-mail address is placed in a database and used to send your issues of The Sovereign Investor and occasional Sovereign Investor Alerts. We will not sell, rent, or otherwise share your e-mail address with anyone.

You can remove your address from our e-mailing list by following the instructions at the end of every e-mail we send. Any e-mail you send to The Sovereign Investor is considered confidential unless you tell us otherwise. We will not add your name to our e-mail list without your permission. If your inquiry is about an order or subscription, Agora’s customer service staff will ask you to verify your identity by confirming information already in your record.

**Personal Information**  
We will never ask you for personal information–your credit card number, for example–except when you place an order. At that time, we will provide a secure (SSL, encrypted) connection and require you to submit only the information needed to complete and fulfill your order. Only authorized employees will have access to this information. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone, nor share it in any other way, unless required to by a law enforcement agency that takes the proper steps to require it. Please note that “personal information” does not include your mailing address. See Mailing Address, below.

**Mailing Address**  
When you give us your mailing address, we will use this information to fulfill your order or subscription and to send you information on other products that may suit your interests. If you don’t want us to send you this other information, please contact our customer service department:

Order Processing Center  
Attn: Customer Service  
P.O. Box 925  
Frederick, MD 21705

Cookies are small files placed on your computer by a web page when you visit it. They can be used to store all sorts of useful information to make your next visit easier and more convenient, but some people are uncomfortable not knowing what information is in a cookie.

The Sovereign Investor web site uses cookies only to compile statistics on the use of the various pages on our site (how many people visit each page and that sort of thing). We do not store or collect any personally identifiable information.

**Policy against advertising our website using unsolicited email messages**

We require that all e-mails promoting [thesovereigninvestor.com](http://thesovereigninvestor.com/) or its products are sent only to clients who have agreed to receive such messages. We prohibit any advertising of our brand and Web site using unsolicited email messages. Not complying with this policy will cause partnership termination and/or affiliate account termination.

If you feel you’ve been sent unsolicited emails promoting our brand or website and would like to register a complaint, please email our abuse department ([abuse@thesovereigninvestor.com](mailto:abuse@thesovereigninvestor.com)). We will immediately investigate all allegations made related to unsolicited messages.
