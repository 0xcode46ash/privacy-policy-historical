# Privacy Statement

This notice describes our privacy policy, by visiting our website you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this notice.

**_Controllers of Personal Information:_**

Any personal information provided to or gathered by us is controlled primarily by T. H. Baker and Co Ltd of 95 High Street, Brierley Hill, West Midlands, England, United Kingdom, DY5 3AU.

 _ **Collection and Use of Personal Information About Customers:**_

When you place an order with us you will be asked to enter your name, address, email address and a contact phone number as well as a password. This will create a user account for you which will allow you to track the progress of your order and will enable you to make future purchases more easily. We do not ask you for your payment card information at this point, so no financial information is stored in your user account. 

The information we learn from customers when they place an order helps us personalise and forever improve your shopping experience with us. We use this information to: handle orders; deliver products and services; process payments; contact you about orders, products, services, special offers and promotional activities; update our records; to improve our store and platform; prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our website; and to enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf. Any third parties must use the information in accordance with this privacy notice and as permitted by the UK's Data Protection Act.

We will only release personal information when we feel it is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements, or to protect the rights, property or safety of thewatchhut.co.uk, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. However, this does not include selling, sharing or otherwise disclosing personal information about customers for commercial purposes.   
Information about our customers is an important part in the running of our business and we will not sell it on to other parties.
