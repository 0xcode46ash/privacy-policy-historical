This notice describes our privacy policy; by visiting our website, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this notice.

## Controllers of Personal Information

Any personal information provided to or gathered by us is controlled primarily by T. H. Baker and Co Ltd of 95 High Street, Brierley Hill, West Midlands, England, United Kingdom, DY5 3AU.

## Collection and Use of Personal Information About Customers

When you place an order with us you will be asked to enter your name, address, email address and a contact phone number as well as a password. This will create a user account for you which will allow you to track the progress of your order and will enable you to make future purchases more easily. We do not ask you for your payment card information at this point, so no financial information is stored in your user account. 

  
The information we learn from customers when they place an order helps us personalise and forever improve your shopping experience with us. We use this information to: handle orders; deliver products and services; process payments; contact you about orders, products, services, special offers and promotional activities; update our records; to improve our store and platform; prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our website; and to enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf. Any third parties must use the information in accordance with this privacy notice and as permitted by the UK's Data Protection Act.

We will only release personal information when we feel it is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements, or to protect the rights, property or safety of thewatchhut.co.uk, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. However, this does not include selling, sharing or otherwise disclosing personal information about customers for commercial purposes. 

Information about our customers is an important part in the running of our business, and we will not sell it on to other parties.

## Cookies

Cookies are pieces of information generated by a Web server and stored in your computer, ready for future access. They are contained in the HTML information which flows backwards and forwards between your computer and the servers. Cookies are used to personalize Web search engines and to store shopping lists of items a user has selected while browsing through an online shop. Essentially, cookies make use of user-specific information transmitted by the Web server onto your computer so that the information might be available for later access by itself or other servers.

  
We use cookies on our website to keep track of the contents of your shopping basket to the checkout. If your computer settings are set to block cookies then you will be unable to make a purchase from our website as the items in your shopping basket will not be carried forward to the checkout. By using cookies in this way we are able to make the shopping process easier for you as they allow you to place items in your shopping basket and store them there for future visits until you purchase them or remove them.

## Payment Information

All payments are processed over a secure server and are fully encrypted, using SSL technology, by our payment provider Sage Pay/HSBC. All of your sensitive card information is encrypted and is not held in clear text on any site. The payment provider will use the information you provide to run security and fraud checks as necessary. Because this information is encrypted and handled by our payment providers we do not store any of this information on our website nor do we have access to your complete card details at any time.
