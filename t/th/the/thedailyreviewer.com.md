# Faq

Below is a list of "how to's" concerning the website. Kindly refer to the answers below before [sending us a question](https://web.archive.org/contact). We're trying to avoid drowning in emails.

### What is The Daily Reviewer?

The Daily Reviewer is a social blog reader website. Technically, it is a community powered rss feed reader that ranks feeds based on popularity.

Each time a user tags a feed, it's popularity increases. This ranking process ensures that you are only presented with the best of the best blogs to read.

### How do I change my blog's title and description as it appears on The Daily Reviewer?

The Daily Reviewer reads your blog's RSS feed to produce a summary. We also take your feed's title and description as it appears. If you would like to change the title and description of your blog as it appears on The Daily Reviewer, you would need to configure your RSS Feed Title and RSS Feed Description.

### How do I add a blog or feed?

We welcome all submissions. To submit a blog, simply [sign in](https://web.archive.org/users/login) (or [register](https://web.archive.org/users/register) if you haven't already). Click on the "[Submit A Blog](https://web.archive.org/submit)" link at the bottom of the page.

### I don't see my blog listed on page (such and such).

The rankings of the blogs fluctuate with every new addition of a blog to that category. Please refer below to know more about the ranking process.

### How do I get my blog to the first page?

We have pre-selected thousands of top blogs (and RSS feeds) for inclusion. There could be hundreds of blogs for a particular category, as such, the first page can only hold a number of blogs. 

The ranking process is automated. It takes into account how many users have "tagged" a certain blog. Tagging a blog for a particular category constitutes one vote. However, a user may only vote once per category.

### What is an RSS Feed?

RSS or "Really Simple Syndication" is the format/protocol that enables blogs, news websites, tweets, podcasts and any other constantly updated information sources to syndicate/share content.

Let's just say RSS gives us the information we want without the visual clutter that each individual website presents.

You can read more about [RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_\(file_format\)) on Wikipedia.
