# Privacy Policy - Tile

Effective Date: October 13, 2016

Tile is designed to make life easier and less stressful. This policy describes what information we collect from you and how we use it to accomplish that mission.

We take your privacy as seriously as you do, and because of that we take great care to collect only the information necessary to provide you with the best possible Tile experience.

As you review our policy, keep in mind that it applies to Tile Inc.’s (“Tile”, “We”, “Us”) website, mobile app, help center, and all other associated services that we provide (“Services”).

## 1. Information Tile Collects

In this Privacy Policy, the term "Personal Information" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to a name, an identification number, or, in certain circumstances, location information, an IP address or the unique identifier allocated to each Tile device. Specifically, we collect the following information from you, which may include Personal Information.

### A. Placing an order

 **i.  Contact Information**

When you place an order on our website, you’ll need to provide an email address, a first and last name, and a shipping address.

 **ii.  Payment Information**

In order to complete your order on our website, you’ll need to provide payment information, such as your credit card or PayPal account. This information is needed in order to process your order and is not stored on our servers.

### B. Registering for the mobile app

You’ll need to use a valid email address and create a password to create an account for Services on the Tile app. You can choose whether or not you’d like to provide your first and last name.

We do not identify you personally to other users or make your account information available to any third parties in any way that could identify you without your prior consent.

### C. Connecting with Social Networks

When you create a Tile account, you may be able to connect and interact with a third-party social networking service (“Social Network”), such as Facebook or Twitter. If you decide to interact with a Social Network when using our Services, we are permitted to collect Personal Information that you have already made public on your Social Network account. You can manage this information in the privacy settings of each Social Network.

### D. Information from Your Use of the Services

 **i.  Tile ID, Name, and Photograph**

When you activate a Tile using the Tile app, that Tile’s unique identifier (or Tile ID) will be associated with your account. If you choose to name your Tile or add a photo of it, this information will also be associated with your account.

 **ii.  Location Information**

Tile is designed to tell you where your items are. In order to do that, it’s necessary to collect data about your location. We use the term “Location Information” to refer to the combined location data of your phone or device, and your Tiles.

While the app is running on your device, it periodically transmits your location information. This allows us to show you, on your map, the last place your Tile was seen by your device. It is one of the primary ways Tile helps you find your lost items.

We may also collect and update location information for your Tile(s) anonymously from other Tile users who are running the app within Bluetooth range of your device. We do this to provide you with the most recent and accurate location of your Tiles, even if they are out of your devices’ Bluetooth range.

The location information associated with your Tile(s) is never made available to these users.

If you use a computer, phone, or other device to visit our website or help center, we use the IP address of that computer or device to determine an approximate location. We do this so that we can provide you with a better, more-personal customer service experience.

We use your Location Information to provide the Services and may use your Location Information to promote the Services or provide you with offers. However, your Location Information is never shared with other users unless you choose to share it through our Services.

 **iii.  Mobile Application Usage Information**

We track how, and how often you use our Services. We also collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use them for Services. This includes information such as your device’s model, operating system type and version, and the dates and times of your requests. We use this information to provide you with optimal services and support, and to collect anonymous statistics that help us understand our user base.

### E. Information Collected Through Tile’s Support Services

We provide support services via live chat on our website, email request submissions, recorded outbound telephone calls and direct email. We collect any Personal Information you may choose to provide to our customer care team in the process. This includes, but is not limited to: your name, email address, phone number, and mailing address. We may use and process your Personal Information, including location information, to handle your support request and provide you with the best support possible.

## 2. Cookies and Other Web Technologies

### A. Cookies

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer’s hard drive or onto your mobile device’s memory -- if your browser is set to accept cookies. Like many other online services, cookies and other tools like them help us collect and understand how you use our services.

Although most internet browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your settings or use third party tools to prompt you before accepting cookies from the websites you choose to visit, or to refuse cookies altogether. You can even delete them through your browser. Most browsers also have settings to prevent them from accepting new cookies, to notify you when you receive a new cookie, or to delete or disable cookies altogether. Some parts of our Services may not work for you if you disable cookies.

### B. How We Use Cookies

We use cookie technology in various ways to help make it easier for you to use our Services. For example, we use cookies to remember you when you return to our website, identify you when you sign-in, authenticate your access, keep track of your in-app specified preferences or choices, tailor content to you or geographic region, display a personalized browsing history, and/or to provide specific technical support.

We may also use cookies to gauge site usage, conduct research and diagnostics to improve the content we provide you, our products and services, and to help us analyze general web traffic.

The cookies we use expire after they have fulfilled their purpose. Some cookies expire when you close your browser (i.e., session cookies) or after a set period of time (i.e., persistent cookies). The expiration time of cookies that are placed by third parties (explained below) is determined by the third party, not us.

### C. Web Beacons

Web beacons (also known as web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard drive, web beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).

### D. Do Not Track

While our website and the Tile app at this time do not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, such as "do not track" instructions, you can generally express your privacy preferences regarding the use of most cookies and similar technologies through your web browser, as indicated above.

## 3. Third Party Services

Sometimes Tile uses third party services, such as certain services offered by Facebook, Google and Mixpanel. These outside services may also collect Personal Information about you and your online activities.

They may also place cookies on your computer's hard drive or your mobile device's memory or use web beacons to collect or receive information from the Services and elsewhere on the internet and use that information to provide analytics and to target ads. The information practices of these outside services are not covered by this Privacy Policy. We cannot access, nor do we have any control over, the cookies or other web technologies they may use.

### A. Web Analysis Services

We may use third party web analysis services to gather non-identifying information to measure how customers in aggregate interact with our website. These services may use cookies or other web technologies to collect usage information, matched to an IP address, to help us analyze how our users use our website and some portions of the Tile app.  We collect this information in order to improve overall experience of our Services for our users.

We utilize Google Analytics, a service provided by Google, Inc., that we use to gather information about how users and visitors engage with our Site and Services. For more information about Google Analytics, please visit [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).

We also use Mixpanel to provide us with analytics data regarding your interactions with our Services.  You may opt-out of Mixpanel’s automatic retention of data collected while using the Services by visiting <https://mixpanel.com/optout/>. To track opt-outs, Mixpanel uses a persistent opt-out cookie placed on your device. Please note that if you get a new computer, install a new browser, erase or otherwise alter the browser’s cookie file (including upgrading certain browsers), you may clear the Mixpanel opt-out cookie.

These outside services may also collect information about your use of other websites over time. Since we do not link any Personal Information that you provide to us within the app to the information we store within the third party analytics software, this additional information is only analyzed in a way that cannot identify you.

### B. Measurement Services and Ad Targeting

We may use tools offered by third party services, such as Facebook, to send data about actions users take on the Services. These third party services may use such data to provide measurement services to Tile or to target ads. You can opt out of the collection and use of information for ad targeting by going to <http://www.aboutads.info/choices> or <http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/>.

### C. Social Plugins and Social Widgets

We may use social plugins, widgets and other features (each, a “Social Feature”) that are made available by and/or access third party Social Networks. These Social Features allow these Social Networks to place cookies on your browser and to collect certain information, which may be associated with your name and personal Social Network account.

These Social Features are operated solely by the respective Social Networks, and their service providers, and we recommend that you carefully read their privacy policies before you decide to use them. We have no control over or access to the information collected, stored or used by such Social Networks, and the information practices of such Social Networks are not covered by this Privacy Policy.

If you do not wish to associate any information collected via the plugins, widgets and/or other features with your personal Social Network account information, you should refrain from using these Social Features and logout from your Social Network account before visiting our Services.

## 4. We Are Not Responsible for Content on Third Party Websites

Our Services may contain links to websites and services that are owned or operated by third parties (each, a “Third-party Service”). Any information that you provide on or to a Third-party Service, or that is collected by a Third-party Service, is provided directly to the owner or operator of the Third-party Service and is subject to the owner’s or operator’s privacy policy. We’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of any Third-party Service. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of all Third-party Services that you access.

## 5. We Use and Disclose Your Personal Information to Provide, Improve, and Promote Our Services

### A. How We Use Your Personal Information (PI)

We may use your Personal Information and Location Information to provide you with a better service, improve the quality of our products and Services, and promote our Services. We use and process your Personal Information and Location Information to create anonymous, statistical and aggregated data reports where individual users are not identified.

### B. How We Disclose Your Personal Information

Tile uses third party services and software solutions, including web hosting and other cloud based services, to provide you with the best possible experience. We may share your Personal Information (including your Location Information and your Tile devices' Location Information) with our third party service providers or affiliates (e.g. cloud-based and hosting services, technical service providers, consultants, mail carriers, communication agencies and customer support providers) in order to provide, improve, and promote the Services on our behalf.

For example, we may disclose Personal Information to our service providers in order to enable them to communicate with you on our behalf. We may also disclose Personal Information to platform providers, such as Facebook, in order to permit such providers to serve ads and promote the Services on our behalf on such platforms.  To the extent possible, your Personal Information will be stored in hashed or obfuscated form.

We will not share your Personal Information with any third parties other than in the circumstances discussed above.

### C. How We Use De-Identified Information

We may share with third parties, including advertisers and service providers, anonymized, aggregated data we collect about you and other users, such as de-identified demographic information, de-identified location information, and information about the computer or device from which you access the Services.

## 6. We May Use and Disclose Your Information for Our Protection and the Protection of Others

### A. How We Use Your Personal Information

We may use and process your Personal Information including Location Information to prevent fraud, misappropriation, infringements, identity theft, and other illegal activities and misuse of our Services.

### B. How We Disclose Your Personal Information

Like other companies, we may disclose your information to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe is necessary to (i) comply with a law, regulation, or legal request; (ii) protect the safety of any person; (iii) address potential violations of our Privacy Policy or terms of service; (iv) investigate fraud, security, or technical issues; or (v) protect Tile’s rights or property, our employees, users and the public.

In addition, if we are acquired by a third party as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale or if our assets are acquired by a third party, in the event we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, some or all of our assets - including any information collected from or about you - may be disclosed or transferred to a third party acquirer in connection with the transaction.

## 7. You May Modify Your Information

We’ll take steps to delete your information as soon as we can, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.

Please note, however, that if you delete your Personal Information, Location Information and Account, the location information associated with any active Tile(s) may still be collected anonymously from other Tile users who are running the app within Bluetooth range (approximately 30-100 ft.) of your device. However, since your Personal Information will be deleted, any new location information that is collected will no longer be associated with your Personal Information. You may dispose of your Tiles at a local e-waste facility or contact customer care at [terms@thetileapp.com](mailto:terms@thetileapp.com) for more information.

We may periodically send you promotional newsletters and emails. You have the opportunity to opt-out of these by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the emails you receive.

## 11. International Transfer

Your Personal Information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.
