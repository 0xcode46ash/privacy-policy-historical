# Privacy Policy

#### Disclaimer & Privacy Policy.

The information we collect through our Site helps us provide you with information specific to your needs and interests. This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) covers the The Luxury Closet website (the “Site” or “The Luxury Closet”), including any registered domain endings, such as “.com”. Please read below to review our Privacy Policy and the types of information we gather through our Site. In this Privacy Policy, “we”, “us”, “our” and other similar references mean The Luxury Closet and “you” and “your” and other similar references mean a specific user of the Site. By visiting the Site, you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

#### How Does The Luxury Closet Gather and Use Information?

Cookies. Cookies are pieces of data assigned by a web server that uniquely identify the browser on your PC. Websites typically use temporary cookies called “session” cookies to ensure that you are recognized when you move from page to page within one site and that any information you have entered is remembered. For example, if an e-commerce site did not use session cookies then items placed in a shopping basket would disappear by the time you reach the checkout. Websites also use cookies called “persistent” cookies to enable a website to remember you on subsequent visits, speeding up or enhancing your experience of services or functions offered. The Luxury Closet attempts to install both persistent and session cookies when a user arrives at our Site. Cookies enable our systems to gather information about your navigational patterns through the site. Viewers have the option to accept or disable cookies at any time through their browsers. If you block or refuse to accept cookies, or delete cookies between visits to the site, you may not be able to access or use certain features or functions of our Site.

Server Statistics. We collect general statistics to track user trends on our Site. These statistics include hits to our server, the types of browsers used to access our Site, page views, and navigational patterns. The information that is collected in this manner does NOT provide us with any personally identifiable information about our users. It helps us track “where” our users are coming from. This allows us to pinpoint high traffic areas and determine the most effective ways to communicate with our users. As part of that ongoing analysis, The Luxury Closet also uses devices called “web beacons” to help us identify when emails sent to you have been received and read. In order to prevent the introduction of viruses and hackers into the The Luxury Closet site we may collect information, such as IP addresses, into a log file to be used to identify potential hackers of the The Luxury Closet site.

Personal Information You Provide Us. When you register on our Site you are required to provide us your username/email address and password. In order to purchase any item or service on our Sites you must also provide us with your full legal name, valid credit card information, and a full street address including city, state and zip code, and telephone number. To protect ourselves and our customers from fraud, we may also collect additional information about our registered users from credit bureaus and other consumer information services.

Every time you use our service, we collect information about your usage. For example, we collect information regarding the products you browse and the orders you place on our Sites. We use the personal information about you stored in our member database in various ways to provide our services to you, to communicate with you, and to otherwise conduct our business. For example, if you are a registered Luxury Closet user, we can pull up personal information you have provided to us, such as your shipping and billing addresses, from our database during the checkout process to make processing your order faster and easier.

We also use information about your activities on our Sites, such as your brand preferences and choices of clothing and accessories, to contact you with special advertisements, offers and notices regarding brands and bags that we believe may fit with your preferences. We also use non-personally identifiable “aggregate” information about how our service is used to improve our service, to make it more responsive to our customers’ preferences, and for other internal purposes. We also make such aggregate information (which does not identify any specific individual) available to third parties. If you contact us by letter, phone, online chat, or email, we will collect your sender information and may collect the other information you voluntarily disclose to us. 

#### What Security Procedures Does The Luxury Closet Use To Protect Personal Information?

We use physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to assist us in preventing unauthorized access, maintaining data accuracy, and correctly using your Personal Information. Except as specified in this Privacy Policy, we use commercially reasonable efforts to limit access to your Personal Information to the employees, agents, and officers of The Luxury Closet, who need the information for their jobs.

#### Does the Luxury Closet store Credit Card details on the site?

Credit Card details are not stored our database or server, and are processed through a secure SSL environment. 

#### Will The Luxury Closet Disclose The Information It Collects To Outside Parties?

We may share your personal information with third party vendors who help us provide our services to you, such as email providers, mail houses, shipping firms, companies that provide us with marketing services, and other such third parties, but such sharing is always done pursuant to a contract that requires the third party to protect the confidentiality of such information and which prohibits them from using the information for any other purposes.

We may also disclose your personally identifiable information as we believe is reasonably necessary to comply with law, regulation or other governmental authority, to determine your credit status or enable debt collection, initiate legal proceedings to recover losses of or otherwise protect our rights or property, or for insurance claim processing, or to prevent harm to yourself or others.

From time to time, we may make our list of registered The Luxury Closet users available for use by select third-party companies whose products or services we believe may be of interest to our registered users. These third-party companies are only permitted to send limited email or postal mailings to our registered users regarding the company’s products or services. Our users’ contact information is provided to a company who manages this process and arranges for the messages to be sent, and is not provided to the third-party advertiser. If you prefer to have your name withheld from receiving email and postal mail from these third-party advertisers, please contact us at customerservice@theluxurycloset.com and let us know.

Lastly, in the event we merge with another company, or we or our assets are acquired by another company, your personally identifiable information would likely be among the assets transferred or shared with such other company. We may disclose Personal Information we collect from you if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that disclosure is necessary (a) to obey the law or comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates; (b) to protect and defend our rights or property or the rights or property of other users of our Site; or (c) to act in an emergency to protect the personal safety of users of our Site or the public. 

#### External Links. Other companies or organizations may have links to their Sites on our Site.

We are not responsible for how these other companies or organizations collect, use, disclose, or secure the information that you provide them. If you choose to access a third party Site linked to our Site, you do so at your own risk and subject to any terms of service or privacy policy (if any) associated with such third party Sites.

#### Collection Of Information From Children.

The Luxury Closet does not direct any of our content specifically to children. Users of our Site are required to be at least eighteen (18) years old, and any user under 18 is not an authorized user. If we learn that a user is under thirteen (13) years of age, we will promptly delete any Personal Information we have collected about that user.

#### Consent To Processing In The Middle East Countries.

By providing any Personal Information to The Luxury Closet, all users, including, without limitation, users in the Middle East countries, fully understand and unambiguously consent to this Privacy Policy and to the transfer of such Personal Information across international borders in accordance with The Luxury Closet standard operations, including the collection, storage, and processing of such information in the Middle East countries.
