# Disclosures/Privacy

**Affiliate Disclosure**

Sometimes, I include affiliate links in my posts here on The Frugal Girl. What are affiliate links? These are links that take you to other sites which offer me some form of compensation for sending them visitors or customers (for instance, if you click on a coupons.com link in one of my posts and print out a coupon from their site, I get a small kickback from coupons.com.  I also am affiliated with Swagbucks, Amazon.com, Groupon, and ING Direct.).

The income from these sorts of links helps to pay for my server costs and for the time I spend running and maintaining this blog. Though I appreciate making some money in exchange for the time I spend working here, this blog chiefly exists to serve its readers, and for that reason, I will never, ever use an affiliate link for a company I don’t wholeheartedly support. If I don’t love a product or a company, I won’t try to convince you to love it, and I will not advertise for that product/company (not even if they offer me piles of money! You are more important than money, and my integrity is too.).

**_Press_**  
Whenever my blog and I appear in the press, whether it be in the newspaper, on TV, or on a website, please keep in mind that my appearance does not function as an endorsement of said newspaper, TV, or website (for instance, if I were on Oprah, it wouldn’t mean that I was in agreement with Oprah on all things. Not that Oprah would ever ask me…I’m just using that as an example).

All information provided on this site is for informational purposes only. TheFrugalGirl.com makes no representations as to the accuracy, completeness, suitability or validity of any information on this site and will not be liable for any errors or omissions in this information or any damages arising from its display or use.
