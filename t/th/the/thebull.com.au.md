TheBull.com.au is committed to ensuring the confidentiality and security of your personal information. 

This Policy applies to The Compare Group ACN 123 319 906 (referred to as "TheBull", "we", "our", "us"). The word "individual" refers to a customer, or advertiser, a consumer, or any other person who accesses our services via our website or any other means, or any person with whom we come into contact. 

This Policy outlines TheBull's obligation to manage and protect the personal information we hold about individuals. 

TheBull is bound by the National Privacy Principles ('NPPs') contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (C'th) ('Privacy Act'). 

'Personal information' is information or an opinion relating to an individual, which can be used to identify that individual. Some personal information which we collect is 'sensitive information'. Sensitive information includes information relating to a person's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion, trade union or other professional or trade association membership, sexual preferences and criminal record, that is also personal information, and also includes health information about an individual. 

**How we collect personal information**

We generally collect personal information directly from the individual. For example, an individual may deal with us on the phone, send us correspondence (by letter, fax or email) or contact us in person. Also, TheBull will collect personal information from forms filled out by individuals, interviews, business documents and from other people. 

Typically, the type of personal information we collect about the individual includes name, age, date of birth, occupation, financial information, mailing address, phone numbers, email address and other information that is relevant to the services we provide. 

In some circumstances TheBull may be provided with personal information about an individual from somebody else, for example a referral from another person. Where this happens, TheBull will take reasonable steps to ensure that the individual is or has been made aware of the matters set out in this Privacy Policy.

TheBull may use and disclose personal information for the primary purposes for which it is collected, for reasonably expected secondary purposes which are related to the primary purpose and in other circumstances authorised by the Privacy Act. Sensitive information will be used and disclosed only for the purpose for which it was provided or a directly related secondary purpose, unless the individual agrees otherwise, or where certain other limited circumstances apply (eg, where required by law).

We engage other people to perform services for us, which may involve that person handling personal information we hold. In these situations, we prohibit that person from using personal information about you except for the specific purpose for which we supply it.

In relation to sensitive information held by us, wherever possible, TheBull will attempt to de-identify the information. We also delete all personal information about an individual when it is no longer needed or relevant.

 **Management of personal information**

The NPPs require us to take all reasonable steps to protect the security of personal information. 

TheBull takes reasonable steps to protect personal information held from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure, for example by use of physical security and restricted access to electronic records. All personal information contained in hard copy documents held by TheBull are stored in locked cabinets. All personal information stored on TheBull's computer system is backed up daily and monthly, and back-up copies are held in a secure location. 

Where we no longer require the personal information for a permitted purpose under the NPPs, we will take reasonable steps to destroy it. 

We will not use identifiers assigned by the Government, such as a tax file number, Medicare number or provider number, for our own file recording purposes. 

**How do we keep personal information accurate and up-to-date?**

TheBull takes reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information it holds is accurate, complete and up-to-date. We encourage individuals to contact us in order to update any personal information we hold about them. Our contact details are set out below. 

**You have the ability to gain access to your personal information**

Subject to the exceptions set out in the Privacy Act, individuals may gain access to the personal information which TheBull holds about them by contacting the TheBull Privacy Officer. If we refuse to provide the information, we will provide reasons for the refusal and inform the individual of any exceptions relied upon under the Privacy Act. When an individual requests access to personal information, which includes evaluative information created by TheBull (as defined in NPP 6.2), a representative of TheBull will meet the individual personally (where this is possible), and explain the evaluative information to the individual, without giving them a copy of it. 

An individual's request for access to his/her personal information will be dealt with by allowing the individual to look at his/her personal information at the offices of TheBull. We will require identity verification and specification of what information is required. An administrative fee for search and photocopying costs may be charged for providing access. We will advise the likely cost in advance whenever practicable.

This Policy will be reviewed from time to time to take account of new laws and technology, changes to our operations and practices and the changing business environment.
