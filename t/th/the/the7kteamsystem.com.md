The7KTeamSystem Privacy Policy

  
Welcome to The7KTeamSystem (the "Site"). 

We understand that privacy online is important to users of our Site, especially when conducting business. This statement governs our privacy policies with respect to those users of the Site ("Visitors") who visit without transacting business and Visitors who register to transact business on the Site and make use of the various services offered by The7KTeamSystem (collectively, "Services") ("Authorized Members"). 

"Personally Identifiable Information" refers to any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains, including, but not limited to, name, address, phone number, fax number, email address. Personally Identifiable Information does not include information that is collected anonymously (that is, without identification of the individual user) or demographic information not connected to an identified individual. 

What Personally Identifiable Information is collected? We may collect basic user profile information from all of our Visitors. We collect the following additional information from our Authorized Members: the names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of Authorized Members. 

How does the Site use Personally Identifiable Information? We use Personally Identifiable Information to customize the Site, to make appropriate service offerings, and to fulfill buying and selling requests on the Site. We may email Visitors and Authorized Members about research or purchase and selling opportunities on the Site or information related to the subject matter of the Site. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to contact Visitors and Authorized Members in response to specific inquiries, or to provide requested information.

Your referrer will have access to your email address to help you with your business. 

How is Personally Identifiable Information stored? Personally Identifiable Information collected by The7KTeamSystem is securely stored and is not accessible to third parties. 

What choices are available to Visitors regarding collection, use and distribution of the information? Visitors and Authorized Members may opt out of receiving unsolicited information from or being contacted by us and/or our vendors and affiliated agencies by responding to emails as instructed, or by contacting us at admin@The7KTeamSystem .com 

Are Cookies Used on the Site? Cookies are used for a variety of reasons. We use Cookies to obtain information about the preferences of our Visitors and the services they select. We also use Cookies for security purposes to protect our Authorized Members. 

How does The7KTeamSystem use login information? The7KTeamSystem uses login information, including, but not limited to, IP addresses, ISPs, and browser types, to analyze trends, administer the Site, track a user's movement and use, and gather broad demographic information. 

How can Visitors correct any inaccuracies in Personally Identifiable Information? Visitors and Authorized Members may contact us to update Personally Identifiable Information about them or to correct any inaccuracies by emailing us at admin@The7KTeamSystem .com 

Can a Visitor delete or deactivate Personally Identifiable Information collected by the Site? We provide Visitors and Authorized Members with a mechanism to delete/deactivate Personally Identifiable Information from the Site's database by contacting admin@The7KTeamSystem .com. However, because of backups and records of deletions, it may be impossible to delete a Visitor's entry without retaining some residual information. An individual who requests to have Personally Identifiable Information deactivated will have this information functionally deleted, and we will not sell, transfer, or use Personally Identifiable Information relating to that individual in any way moving forward. 

What happens if the Privacy Policy Changes? We will let our Visitors and Authorized Members know about changes to our privacy policy by posting such changes on the Site. However, if we are changing our privacy policy in a manner that might cause disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information that a Visitor or Authorized Customer has previously requested not be disclosed, we will contact such Visitor or Authorized Customer to allow such Visitor or Authorized Customer to prevent such disclosure.
