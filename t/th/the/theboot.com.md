The Boot International (’The Boot’), is aware that you may wish to be informed about how your personally identifying data and information, such as name, address, telephone/fax numbers or e-mail address etc ("Data") that you may send via the Internet to The Boot International website is treated. Accordingly, we have developed this Privacy Policy (’Policy’) to explain our use of your Data as well as all our reasonable precautions to keep your Data confidential and secure.

By accessing to our website and using our services, you are consenting to the Data collection and use practices described in this Policy, as modified from time to time by us. If we decide to modify our Policy, we will post a new Policy on our websites changing the date in the last paragraph of such Policy. Therefore, we invite you to consult this Policy from time to time in order to familiarise yourself with any changes.

The terms of this Policy are without prejudice to any contractual terms you may enter into with us, which shall prevail over the terms of this Policy.

 **1.0 Pledge on Privacy**

The Boot International does not collect and process Data except when specifically, voluntarily and knowingly provided by you. We ensure compliance by our staff with strict standards of security and confidentiality and in processing your Data we pledge to fully comply with internationally recognized standards of privacy protection.

 **2.0 Intended Use of Data**

Most of our services do not require any form of registration allowing you to visit our website without telling us who you are. However, some services may require registration. When you register with us, you may need to complete certain fields (some are required, some are optional) as well as chose a user name and password. In these situations, if you chose to withhold any Data requested by us, it may not be possible for you to gain access to certain parts of our websites and for us to respond to your queries.

The Boot International collects and processes Data only for specific and limited purposes which we inform you about when you wish to use certain services offered on our websites. For example, we may collect and use Data to provide you with our products or services, to bill you for products or services you request, to market products and services we believe might be of interest to you, to process your job application, to receive news releases, or to communicate with you for other purposes. In addition, we may use your Data to evaluate the effectiveness of and improve our services to our visitors and customers, for our own internal statistical and operational purposes, to evaluate customer interests as well as purchasing and other trends among customers and to better determine product development and marketing strategies. By submitting your Data, you expressly consent to such use. The Boot International keeps your Data only for as long as is reasonably needed for such purposes and in accordance with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or document retention requirements.

 **3.0 Non Disclosure of Information**

The Boot International shall never sell, rent, share or otherwise distribute or make available your Data to third parties outside of The Boot International, except when required to do so for legal or regulatory purposes. However, Data may occasionally be transferred to third parties, who act for or on behalf of The Boot International, for further processing in accordance with the purposes for which your Data were originally collected. When disclosure of Data to third parties is likely or necessary for whatever reason, The Boot International shall endeavour to ensure that such third parties provide the same level of protection as The Boot International, and, where appropriate, we will contractually require them to process Data transferred only for the purposes authorised by you and on a confidential and secure basis.

We undertake to take all reasonable steps in order not to allow your Data to be seen by third parties other than those who act for or on behalf of The Boot International and have agreed to treat your Data confidential and secure. Access to Data is restricted to those of our employees on a need to know basis and who have been trained to observe strict standards of confidentiality in handling your Data. Although, we have tried to create secure, reliable and trustworthy websites for our visitors, please be aware that the Internet is generally not regarded as a complete secure environment, and that therefore the confidentiality of the Data provided by you or material transmitted via our websites or by e-mail cannot be guaranteed by The Boot International. Thus, we can not be responsible or liable for the security of your Data whilst in transit via the Internet to us.

 **6.0 Data Transfer Abroad**

The Boot International is an international company and has databases in different jurisdictions. The Boot International may transfer your Data to one of its databases or outside of your country of residence. If the level of privacy protection in a country does not comply with internationally recognized standards, we will ensure that Data transfers to our databases in that country are equally protected and that a transfer of Data to third parties in such countries does not occur.

 **7.0 Anonymous Data / “Cookie” Technology**

Most of the information we collect from our websites is anonymous information. When you visit our website, we do not collect any personal Data from you unless specifically, voluntarily and knowingly provided by you. Anonymous information is processed by The Boot International to help improve the content of our website, to customise our website for our visitors and to learn more about them and how they use our website. In doing so, The Boot International may use tracking technology (cookies) to gather anonymous information, such as browser type, operating systems and the date and time of access. “Cookies” by themselves cannot be used to discover the identity of the user. A “cookie” is a small piece of information which is sent to your browser and stored on your computer hard drive.

 **8.0 Spamming**

The Boot International does not conduct “spamming”. Spamming is defined as sending unsolicited e-mails, usually of commercial nature, in large numbers and repeatedly to individuals with whom the sender has had no previous contact or who have declined to receive such communications. On the contrary, where we believe that one of our products or information is of importance to you, we inform you by e-mail whilst giving you the choice of opting out of such service.

As a service to our visitors, our website may provide hyperlinks to other websites that are not operated or controlled by The Boot International. Therefore, The Boot International can not be responsible or liable for the content of such websites or the privacy practises of such other parties.
