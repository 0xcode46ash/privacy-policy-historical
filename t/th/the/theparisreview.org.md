We may collect Personally Identifiable Information from you in different manners and at different places on our Website, such as when you subscribe to the _Paris Review_ Newsletter, or purchase a subscription to _The Paris Review_ or purchase any other product from our [Store](http://www.theparisreview.org/store.php) or on our Website. In all of these cases, we will collect Personally Identifiable Information from you only if you voluntarily submit such information to us.

**WHEN WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES**

Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose any information we gather from you on our Website. 

We may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information if we believe in good faith that we are required by law to do so. We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information in special circumstances when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to protect the safety and/or security of our users, our Website, or the general public. 

We may employ independent contractors, vendors or suppliers (collectively, “Outside Contractors”) to provide specific services and products related to our Website or Products, such as providing credit card processing and fraud screening, and fulfilling purchase orders. Access to your Personally Identifiable Information by these contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for the Outside Contractors to perform their limited function for us. We also require that these contractors (i) protect the privacy of your Personally Identifiable Information consistent with this Privacy Policy, and (ii) not use or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose other than providing us with products or services for which we contracted. 

In addition, through our Website, you may be given the opportunity to purchase (or obtain more information) regarding certain content, products, or services which are sold through a person or company other than us (collectively, “Third Party Sellers”). Third Party Sellers may request that you submit certain information to them in order to purchase their products or services or to obtain additional information from them. By submitting the requested information, you affirmatively consent to have that information shared with the Third Party Seller. This information is used by the Third Party Seller and may be subject to a different privacy policy. We do not otherwise share or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to Third-Party Sellers. 

We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of theparisreview.org provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy. We will notify users of any such transfer through notice on our Website and through E-mail. 

**DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLY WHEN I LINK TO OTHER WEBSITES?**

Our Website contains links to other websites not owned or operated by the Foundation. We are not responsible for the content, accuracy, privacy practices and performance of those websites. We encourage you to be aware when our Website links to other websites and read the privacy policies or statements of each and every website. This Privacy Policy applies solely to the information collected by our Website. 

**IS THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT SECURE?**

We want your information, including your Personally Identifiable Information, to remain as secure as possible. We strive to secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers through industry-standard techniques. To help ensure the integrity and privacy of the Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us via the Internet at the time you purchase any product online, we use Verisign as our Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) digital certificate provider. Your Personally Identifiable Information, including your credit card information, is encrypted while traveling the Internet. We secure Personally Identifiable Information you provide on servers located in controlled, secure environments, protected from unauthorized access, use or alteration. Only employees who need access to your information to perform a specific task or function are granted access to such information. 

Notwithstanding the above commitments to protect your Personally Identifiable Information from loss, misuse or alteration by third parties, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet. There is also some risk that others could find a way to thwart our security systems. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security and privacy of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. 

**CHOICES THAT I HAVE REGARDING THE COLLECTION, DISCLOSURE, AND DISTRIBUTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.**

Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will only use Personally Identifiable Information for the purposes described above or as otherwise disclosed at the time we request such information from you. You may “opt-out” of receiving other communications by contacting our Postmaster at the address set out below. 

**3\. General Information**

You can always contact us in order to (1) update or correct your Personally Identifiable Information, (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you may receive from us, or (3) delete the Personally Identifiable Information maintained about you on our systems, by contacting our Postmaster at the address set out below. Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will not have an effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third-parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion. 

You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us on our systems. The need to back-up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your Personally Identifiable Information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. We promise that promptly after receiving your request, all Personally Identifiable Information stored in databases we actively use and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted as appropriate, as soon as reasonably practicable. 

**CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY.**

If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on our Website so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use Personally Identifiable Information in a manner significantly different from that stated in this Privacy Policy, or otherwise disclosed to you, at the time it was collected, we will notify you by posting changes on our Website in this Privacy Policy, or by email or otherwise, and you will have a choice as to whether or not we use your Personally Identifiable Information in the new manner.
