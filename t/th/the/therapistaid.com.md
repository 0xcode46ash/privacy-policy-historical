## Therapy Tools

### Interactive Therapy Tools

#### Phone, Tablet, and Computer Compatibility

* * *

Interactive therapy tools have been designed to work on a wide range of machines including phones, tablets, desktop computers, and laptops.

#### Interactive Tools Not Working

* * *

If an interactive therapy tool is not working correctly, it may be due to your web browser being out of date. Thankfully, this problem is easy to fix! Web browsers are free, and they should be updated regularly for your own security on the internet.

If you've made sure your web browser is up-to-date, and you're still having issues, let us know. Email us at [support@TherapistAid.com](mailto:support@TherapistAid.com).

  


### Worksheets

#### How do I open and print worksheets?

* * *

Our worksheets are saved as PDF files, which can be opened with software such as Adobe Acrobat Reader or Foxit Reader. The software required to open PDF files is usually pre-installed on phones, tablets, and computers.

If you're having trouble opening or printing our worksheets, the culprit is usually a bug in your PDF reading software. We find that our worksheets work great with the latest version of Foxit Reader.

  


#### Have your worksheets been translated?

* * *

Yes, a good number of our worksheets have been translated to Spanish. There's no way to filter by langauge just yet, but here's a trick to help you find what you need. Visit our [search page](https://web.archive.org/search) and type in "spanish", plus whatever topic you're interested in. If one of our worksheets has a translation, you'll notice an "alternate langauge" line right above the download button.

Have a specific worksheet you would like to see translated? Let us know! We're haphazardly translating our way through our library, and we'll have no problem moving something to the top of the queue.

Want to help with translations? First of all: Thank you! Reach out to us at [contact@TherapistAid.com](mailto:contact@TherapistAid.com) and we'll get you set up.

### What to Expect

#### What is the Therapist Aid newsletter? ...Are you going to spam me?

* * *

Let us start by saying: we hate spam as much as you do. We never share our users' email addresses, and we never send spam. On average, we send about one email per month, and it's almost always because we have new tools to share.

If you sign up for our newsletter, you'll be notified when we've added new tools to the site. We also like to share a little behind-the-scenes info about the creation of our tools, and some links to interesting mental health news, research, videos, and resources.

We think you'll like our newsletter! It's simple, and helpful. But we know people change their minds, so we make it easy to cancel.

  


### List Removal

#### Can I be removed from the newsletter?

* * *

Of course. At the bottom of every newsletter you receive, you'll notice an "unsubscribe" link. Or, [click here](http://therapistaid.us10.list-manage.com/unsubscribe?u=7c676d909f902cf38db90325e&id=3c65052cce) and enter the email address you would like to unsubscribe.
