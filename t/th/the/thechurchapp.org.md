# Privacy — Subsplash.com | Engage your audience like never before.

Subsplash’s Customer Privacy Policy covers the collection, use, protection, disclosure, correction and deletion of personal information. Please take a moment to read the following to learn more about our information practices, including what type of information is gathered, how the information is used and for what purposes, to whom we disclose the information, and how we safeguard your personal information. Your privacy is a priority at Subsplash, and we go to great lengths to protect it.

### Why we collect personal information

We collect your personal information because:

  * If you wish to utilize the Subsplash Account functionality (“Subsplash Account Services”), Subsplash needs your information for purposes of processing and transmitting information to drive the correct data and content between servers and apps for your experience;
  * It helps Subsplash deliver a superior level of customer service;
  * It enables Subsplash to give you convenient access to our products and services and focus on categories of greatest interest to you;
  * In addition, your personal information helps Subsplash keep you posted on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers, and events that you might like to hear about. If you do not want Subsplash to keep you up to date with Subsplash news, software updates and the latest information on products and services please send an email request to privacy@subsplash.com.



### What information we collect and how we may use it

If you wish to utilize the Subsplash Account functionality (“Subsplash Account Services”), Subsplash needs your information for purposes of processing and transmitting information to drive the correct data and content between servers and apps for your experience.

Also, there are a number of situations in which your personal information may help us give you better service. For example:

  * We may ask for your personal information when you’re discussing a service issue on the phone with an associate, downloading a software update, registering for a seminar, participating in an online survey, registering your products, or purchasing a product;
  * When you interact with Subsplash, we may collect personal information relevant to the situation, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and contact preferences; your credit card information and information about the Subsplash products you own, such as their serial numbers and date of purchase; and information relating to a support or service issue;
  * We also collect information for market research purposes — such as your occupation and where you use your computer — to gain a better understanding of our customers and thus provide more valuable service;
  * We collect information regarding customer activities on our websites and applications. This helps us to determine how best to provide useful information to customers and to understand which parts of our websites, products, and Internet services are of most interest to them.;
  * We may use personal information to provide products and/or services that you have requested as well as for auditing, research, and analysis to improve Subsplash’s products.



### Publicly displayed information is public 

If you use a bulletin board or chat room on an Subsplash website you should be aware that any information you share is visible to other users. Personally identifiable information you submit to one of these forums can be read, collected, or used by other individuals to send you unsolicited messages. Subsplash is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. For example, if you choose to make information, which was previously non-public, available by enabling certain user features, Subsplash will collect that information from your interaction and the information will become publicly available.

### When we disclose your information 

Subsplash takes your privacy very seriously. Subsplash does not sell or rent your contact information to other marketers or any other third party. If you wish to utilize the Subsplash Account functionality, Subsplash discloses your information to third party service providers and institutions for purposes of processing and transmitting information to drive the correct data and content between servers and apps for your experience.

### Within the Subsplash Group

TJET, LLC and Subsplash, Inc. both operate under the name “Subsplash” and they operate as a group.  To help us provide superior service, your personal information may be shared with legal entities within the Subsplash group globally who will take reasonable steps to safeguard it in accordance with Subsplash’s privacy policy.

### With our service providers, vendors, and strategic partners

There are also times when it may be advantageous for Subsplash to make certain personal information about you available to companies that Subsplash has a strategic relationship with or that perform work for Subsplash to provide products and services to you on our behalf. These companies may help us process information, extend credit, fulfill customer orders, deliver products to you, manage and enhance customer data, provide customer service, assess your interest in our products and services, or conduct customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are also obligated to protect your personal information in strict accordance with Subsplash’s policies, except if we inform you otherwise at the time of collection. Without such information being made available, it would be difficult for you to purchase products, have products delivered to you, receive customer service, provide us feedback to improve our products and services, or access certain services, offers, and content on the Subsplash website.

At times we may be required by law or litigation to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we reasonably determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary. If you utilize the Subsplash Account functionality Subsplash processes and transmits information to drive the correct data and content between servers and apps for your experience.

### How we protect your personal information

Subsplash takes precautions — including administrative, technical, and physical measures — to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. The Subsplash Online Store and Subsplash Accounts use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is required. To make purchases from the Subsplash Online Store, or Subsplash Accounts, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Safari, Netscape Navigator 3.0 or later, or Internet Explorer. Doing so protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it’s transmitted over the Internet. You can help us by also taking precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure web browser like Safari.

### Integrity of your personal information

Subsplash allows you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date. Naturally, you have the right to access, correct and delete the personal information you have provided. In the event that you delete your information, such deletion may make it impossible for Subsplash to continue offering you some or all Service.

### Kids

Subsplash recognizes that parents, guardians, or other adults often purchase our products for family use, including use by minors. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 for marketing purposes, but because some information is collected electronically, it can appear to be the personal information of the Subsplash purchaser of the product, and will be treated as such by this privacy policy. If a child under 13 submits personal information to Subsplash and we learn that that personal information is the information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.

### Cookies and other technologies

As is standard practice on many corporate websites, Subsplash’s website uses “cookies” and other technologies to help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. We also use cookies and other technologies to make sure that our online advertising is bringing customers to our products and services, such as iTunes. We use cookies and other technologies to study traffic patterns on our website, to make it even more rewarding as well as to study the effectiveness of our customer communications. And we use cookies to customize your experience and provide greater convenience each time you interact with us.

If, however, you prefer not to enable cookies, you can disable them in your browser. Please note that certain features of the Subsplash website and Subsplash online products will not be available once cookies are disabled. As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

In some of our email messages we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Subsplash website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email. In addition we use pixel tags — tiny graphic images — to tell us what parts of our website customers have visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches customers perform on our site.

Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read. And they tell us whether emails have been opened to ensure that we’re sending only messages that are of interest to our customers. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a customer.

### Our companywide commitment to your privacy

As we said, Subsplash takes protecting your privacy very seriously. To make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate these guidelines to Subsplash employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.

### Privacy questions

If you have questions or concerns about Subsplash’s Customer Privacy Policy or data processing, please contact us via email at privacy@subsplash.com. Subsplash may update its privacy policy from time to time. When we change the policy in a material way a notice will be posted on our website along with the updated privacy policy.
