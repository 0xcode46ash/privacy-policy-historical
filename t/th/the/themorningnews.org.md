The Morning News does not collect, harvest, gather, or in any way retrieve information about our readers unless we explicitly ask for the information—for marketing surveys, email newsletters, etc.—and any information that finds its way into our hands is used only for its stated purposes.

The Morning News may link to external sites that request personal information for access or participation.

Somebody who has no problem eating parents.
