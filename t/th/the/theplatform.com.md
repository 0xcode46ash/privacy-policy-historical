_Effective August 10, 2015_

## thePlatform Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”)

As the Internet and the World Wide Web accelerate the exchange of information between businesses and their clients, privacy and the safeguarding of information become increasingly important concerns. This Privacy Policy describes how thePlatform collects and uses the personal information you provide on our Website, [www.thePlatform.com](https://www.theplatform.com/) and within our Media Publishing System console, Community Manager, Support, and Technical Resource Center (“Service Portals”). We occasionally ask you to give us information that helps us learn your requirements so that we can refine both our web site and our product offerings to better match your specific needs. Because we know how important it is to handle any information about you responsibly, we follow a policy that protects your privacy and makes sure that any information you trust us with is used to help us form a business relationship with you that benefits both your company and thePlatform for Media, Inc. (“thePlatform,” “us,” “we,” or “our”) – a wholly owned subsidiary of Comcast Corp.

thePlatform has received TRUSTe’s Privacy Seal signifying that this Privacy Policy and our practices have been reviewed for compliance with the TRUSTe program viewable on the validation page available by clicking the TRUSTe seal.

The TRUSTe certification covers our collection, use and disclosure of information we collect through our website [www.thePlatform.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20150908084347id_/https://www.theplatform.com/privacy-policy/www.theplatform.com/) and our service the Service Portals. The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the Client has engaged thePlatform.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact TRUSTe at <https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>.

We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, consistent with any changes to our business practices. The revised policy will take effect the date they are posted on this web site. If we materially change our practices with regard to personal information collected under a prior Privacy Policy, we will endeavor to notify you at the contact email that we have and give you the opportunity to opt out of changes with regard to that previously collected information. At the minimum we will place a prominent notice on our web site. Your continued use of this web site shall be deemed to be your acceptance of the modified terms. Please review these posted terms on a regular basis.

### Safe Harbor

thePlatform complies with the U.S. – E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S. – Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union and Switzerland respectively. Information regarding both the E.U. and Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks can be found at: <http://export.gov/safeharbor>.

Please note that we only collect information from users in the European Union and Switzerland if our online console for media publishing is configured by our customer to do so or otherwise at our customer’s request.

## INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE ON OUR WEB SITE

When you request information from us, we may ask you to fill out a form soliciting information about you, your company, or your business. We might ask for contact information, such as your name, telephone number, address, e-mail address, and we may request that you create a username and password to log into the site. We might also ask you to tell us what your job function is or what digital media management solutions your company uses or plans to use. In most cases, the information is required, and you can’t receive the information if you don’t fill out the form.

We use the information we collect to build strong business relationships with our customers. We want your business, so we want our sales team to contact you. But when they do, we want them to know your needs and business requirements so they can offer you solutions that help your business succeed. We also use your contact information to send you information that we hope will help you make sound purchasing decisions – white papers discussing industry trends; customer newsletters; invitations to events such as seminars, Webcasts, and user conferences; and product announcements and upgrades.

## GENERAL PRIVACY PRACTICES: All Users

### Disclosure of Personal Information

We do not sell or exchange the personal information you share with us with other parties except as described in this Privacy Policy (see “Business Transitions” below). We may disclose it if required to do so by applicable law, to comply with legal process, or in the event of a sale of the assets of our company. Of course, if you post information on any of the blogs, forums, or other editorial sections of our web site, any information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by anyone. Any information you post could be used to contact you. We are not responsible for information you choose to submit through these features.

Note that we may provide aggregated data regarding usage of our site and other non-personally identifying information to third parties. The statistics we compile regarding usage of the web site are provided only in aggregate form, contain no personal information and cannot be used to discern such information.

We use other third parties such as our hosting provider and marketing partners to provide services on our behalf. Our service providers will only use the information shared with them to provide the services we have contracted them for. Our service providers may not use your information for their own marketing purposes.

### Business Transitions

In the event thePlatform goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email or prominent notice on our Web site for thirty (30) days following the transaction of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personally information.

### Tracking Technologies

Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by thePlatform and our product partners, affiliates, or analytics or video service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. Our systems are not set up to track, collect or distribute personal information about you automatically or without your knowledge. Our systems do recognize the home server of users of the web site, but not their email addresses. For example, our computer servers can tell which Internet Service Provider visitors to our web sites use, and the IP addresses associated with users’ computers, but not the names, addresses or other information that would allow us to identify particular users of our sites. The non-personal information collected by our servers is used for internal purposes only (such as to ensure the smooth functioning of our web sites and efficient delivery of content on the sites, for example knowledge of the web browser used allows content to be displayed in the manner best suited for that web browser) by thePlatform’s technical support staff.

In addition, our third party tracking utility partners and thePlatform’s servers track information about the visits to our web sites using log files. For example, we compile statistics that show the daily number of visitors to our sites, the daily requests we receive for particular files on our sites and what countries those requests come from. These aggregated statistics are used internally to provide better services to our web site users. These log files are not tied to personally identifiable information.

### Links to Third Party Sites

This Privacy Policy applies only to information you supply directly to thePlatform via the thePlatform web site, or via e-mail in response to offers and promotions on the thePlatform web site or the Service Portals. As you explore thePlatform.com, you may find links to other web resources – partner and customer sites and professional resources such as organizations and publications. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to these web sites, and you should check the policies of any linked site before offering information to the sponsor of the site.

### Security

We use appropriate industry practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your account information and to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information as described in this Privacy Policy. However, no data transmitted over the Internet is 100% secure. When you enter sensitive information (such as login credentials) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). If you have any questions about security on our web site, you can contact [info@thePlatform.com](mailto:info@theplatform.com).
