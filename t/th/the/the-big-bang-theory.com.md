# The Big Bang Theory Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy

What we collect:

The Big Bang Theory Site, like most sites, collects log files of visitors' activity. These log files hold **non-personal information** such as: your IP address, which browser or operating system you're using, any plug-ins (such as Flash Player) your browser uses, and which pages or files you view on the site.

Geo-location data from your IP address is also collected. This is usually your country and city, although in most cases is only accurate to a state/county level. This information does not reveal your exact location to us.

The Big Bang Theory Site, like many sites with interactive areas, will collect **potentially personally identifiable information** if you provide it to us. This data is only collected by you filling out a form in our forums, contact system or other interactive areas. This data may include your name, your username, your e-mail address or your password (encrypted and secured to industry standards). Interactive areas of the site, such as contests, may provide additional information in their own privacy policy.

What we do with it:

Log files are used to analyze traffic to this website. The information in our log files, which is not personal information, is shared with a few select companies.

Personal information, such as your e-mail address, is not shared with anybody outside of this site, except where noted. You may, in the process of using this site, provide your information to third parties acting on our behalf. In all instances it will be made clear who is operating the service should you wish to consult their privacy policies.

Who we share it with:

The following companies are able to collect anonymous data through site: ValueClick Media, Google Analytics, Google Adsense, Amazon.com, Amazon.co.uk, Media.net, and Quantcast. They may use non-personal information related to your visits to this and other participating sites to target advertising based on your generic interests ("behavioral advertising"). This broad demographic information is also made available to this site, so we can better understand the range of people who visit this site.

You can [**opt-out of behavioral advertising at the Network Advertising Initiative website**](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). This will stop behavioral advertisement targeting by Google, ValueClick Media, Quantcast and other listed publishers. You may also [opt-out of Google's program on their website](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/view).

We do not share personal information with anybody outside of this website, except when required to by law or where it is otherwise noted.

 ****

How long it's held for:

We aim to delete anonymous log files within 6 months. Information you submit to our forums or comment system (such as posts & comments) is not routinely deleted unless you specifically request it be. Requests can usually be made through the forum system. In cases where you are unable to delete your data then you will be required to contact us for removal. Submissions you make to the site may be anonymized, under request, as opposed to being removed from the site.
