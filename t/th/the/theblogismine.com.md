# Privacy Policy | TheBlogIsMine.com

At TheBlogIsMine, Ltd. (“TheBlogIsMine”) we appreciate your readership and support and place a high value on your personal privacy. We respect the personal nature of the information you provide us on our web site and staunchly recognize the importance of protecting this information. In adopting this privacy policy (this “Privacy Policy”),   our intent is to balance our legitimate business interests in collecting and using your personal information with your reasonable expectations of privacy. This Privacy Policy may be revised or updated at any time and we encourage you to check back often to ensure that you are familiar with the most recent version and the terms of our Privacy Policy.

## When does TheBlogIsMine collect my personal information?

You may provide personal information to TheBlogIsMine in one of three ways: (1) by sharing your e-mail address when subscribing to our newsletter, (2) by sharing personal information when you submit news tips to our editorial team or by submitting a report via our Contact Form, (3) by sharing personal information when you post comments on our posts or stories.

We may also ask for other information at other times but at no time will you be required to share any personal information to gain complete access to our site. TheBlogIsMine is an open community but email addresses are requested to participate in some of our member-only features.

In addition to basic contact information, our analytics trackers may also collect information that is in no way personally identifiable. This may include the operating system you are working on, the Internet browser you  
are using, and the screen resolution of your computer.

## How does TheBlogIsMine use my personal information?

Depending on the portion of our site that you have subscribed to, we may use your  
information in a number of ways.

  * The email address you provided through our newsletter subscription form enables us to send you a daily digest of TheBlogIsMine news stories. This subscription is  entirely opt-in by the user. (We cannot subscribe you to the newsletter as you personally  must have access to the email account in order to verify the subscription.) Subscribers  can opt-out of our newsletter at any time by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link that is present on every email at the very bottom of the newsletter.
  * The email address that you use when contacting us with an editorial tip or via  our Contact Form will not be used for any reason but for the purposes of responding to your inquiry.
  * The email address associated with your account when you comment on our stories  may be used in conjunction with contests and promotions hosted on TheBlogIsMine’s  website to notify you if you have won. Email addresses provided in comments are not used for any other reason.
  * If you choose to comment on TheBlogIsMine stories through Twitter and/or Facebook  Connect, we do not get access to your email address nor do we have any access to  your personal data or private information.



To maintain a site that is free of charge, we display advertisements on our website. We also use information you give us through surveys to help our advertisers target the audience they want to reach and to provide you with potentially interesting advertisements.

At no time does any party other than TheBlogIsMine have access to your personally identifiable information (with the exception of Google who maintains our RSS subscription-by-email service and our survey providers), and you will never be contacted by any party other than TheBlogIsMine.

The only exceptions to the foregoing are that we may disclose personally identifiable information (i) in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or subpoena, (ii) in response to a law enforcement agency’s request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take actions regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of another person, violations  of our terms of use, or as otherwise required by law, or (iii) in the event we are acquired by or merged with another company.

When you sign up for our updates or receive e-mail messages from TheBlogIsMine, you will always be given the chance  
to opt-out of our communications. You may change your preferences at any time and will only be contacted in manners consistent with your stated preferences. Non-personally identifiable information (such as stated above) may be shared in aggregate form with our advertisers or marketing partners but your personally identifiable information  
will never be disclosed to them.

## Who else has access to my personal information?

## Is there anything else I should know about my privacy and TheBlogIsMine?

Any information you disclose voluntarily on our comments page or in any properties hosted by TheBlogIsMine becomes public information. TheBlogIsMine.com is a public forum.

## TheBlogIsMine Comment Policy

We never censor comments based on political or ideological point of view or of a critical nature. We reserve the right to delete those comments that are off-topic, “spammy” in nature, abusive, use excessive foul language, or include ad hominem attacks. Once a comment is made public on the TheBlogIsMine website, we will not remove it by request. As a user, you are responsible for your own communications and are responsible for the consequences of their posting.

Comments will only be considered for removal (i) in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order, or (ii) in response to a law enforcement agency’s request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take actions regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of another person, violations of our terms of use, or as otherwise  required by law.
