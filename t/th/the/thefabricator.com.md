# Privacy Policy - Fabricators & Manufacturers Association Intl. (FMA)

Last updated June 13, 2011

#### Introduction

We take your privacy seriously. Our policy is clear: we collect no personally identifiable information about you when you use any of our websites unless you provide that information to us. Unless we have your authorization or are required to do so by law or other extraordinary circumstances, we will not share with any third party the personally identifiable information that we obtain from you.

#### What this policy covers

This privacy policy covers the treatment of information we collect when you visit or use any of the websites that are owned, published or operated by (1) Fabricators & Manufacturers, International, (2) Nuts, Bolts & Thingamajigs, The Foundation of the Fabricators & Manufacturers Association, International, or (3) FMA Communications, Inc. This policy does not describe information collection policies and practices of websites and platforms that we do not provide, including those linked to or integrated with our websites (e.g., Facebook). It also does not cover information you may choose to share with other users of our websites.

#### Children’s information

Our websites are not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, and any such disclosure is strictly prohibited.

### Information we collect

We do not collect any personally identifiable information about you other than that which you affirmatively choose to submit to us, such as your e-mail address, postal address and name. From time to time we automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit any one of our websites, such as the IP address of your computer or network connection, the time and date of your visit, the pages that you access, and the number of times you return to the website. This information is not used to identify you, but is used in the aggregate for our internal marketing and similar purposes. This process may involve the automatic placement of a small, removable text file (commonly referred to as a “cookie”) on your computer’s hard drive.

#### How we use the information we collect

We use the information collected to improve our site, target advertisements or other content on the site to products or services that may be of interest to you. We may share this information with other interested parties from whom we think you may want to receive information. We may also use information we collect to analyze user behavior as a measure of interest in and use of the our websites, and may disclose such analyses to advertisers or other third parties in the form of aggregate data, such as overall patterns or demographic reports that do not describe or identify any individual user. We may disclose information about you to third parties if we have a good-faith belief that we are required to do so by law or legal process, to respond to legal claims, or to protect the our rights, property or safety or the rights, property or safety of others.

#### User-provided information and other parties

If you provide information on our websites, or to any other party through any of our websites, you should be aware that your information may then be made available to others.

### Right to opt out

At any time after we collect personally identifiable information, you will have an opportunity to “opt out” of any use or disclosure of it. You may request to opt out by sending an email to [info@fmanet.org](mailto:info@fmanet.org).

#### E-mail

If you contact us by e-mail, you should be aware that e-mail transmissions might not be secure. Information you send by e-mail could be viewed in transit by a third party. We will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during transmission.

#### Changes to this policy

We reserve the right to change or update this policy, or any policies or practices, at any time without notice to you. Without affecting our rights to change this policy, we will attempt to notify you using the information we have on file of any material changes. Any changes or updates will be effective immediately upon posting to any of the websites.
