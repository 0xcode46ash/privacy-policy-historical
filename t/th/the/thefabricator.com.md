Last updated February 15, 2017

**Introduction**

We take your privacy seriously. Our privacy policy as stated below covers our collection of personal information in different forms as well as our use and disclosure of such information. We employ practices and processes that are designed to keep us in compliance with applicable privacy laws and good business practices when it comes to safeguarding the confidentiality of your personal information.

**What this policy covers**

This privacy policy covers the collection, use, storage, treatment and disclosure of personal information we collect when you visit or use any of the websites that are owned, published or operated by the Fabricators and Manufacturers Association (FMA), FMA Communications (FMAC) or FMA Communications Canada (FMACC) (individually, the “website” and collectively, the “websites”). It also covers personal information disclosed to  us when you register for a subscription with us via mail, our websites, or telemarketing. This policy does not describe privacy policies and practices of websites and platforms that we do not provide, including those linked to, or integrated with, our websites (e.g., Facebook). It also does not cover personal information you may choose to share with other users of our websites.

By using our websites, you signify your consent to the collection, use, storage, treatment and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this policy. If you do not agree with this policy, you may not use our websites.

**Children’s personal information**

Our websites and subscription efforts are not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information concerning or from children under the age of 13.

**Non-personally identifiable information we collect**

From time to time we automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit any one of our websites, such as the IP address of your computer or internet service provider, the time and date of your visit, the pages that you access, the website from which you linked to our website, the sections of the website you visit, and the number of times you return to the website. This information is not used to identify you, but is used in the aggregate for our internal marketing, system administration, website improvements and other similar purposes. This process may involve the automatic placement of a small, removable text file (commonly referred to as a “cookie”) on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies enhance the convenience and use of our websites. You may choose to decline cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may affect your use of the websites and your ability to access certain features of the websites.

Your non-personally identifiable information may be disclosed to others and permanently archived for future use.

**Personal information we collect**

During your use of the websites, you may be asked to voluntarily provide certain personal information for purposes such as facilitating communications with you or for applying for access to certain special features or areas of the websites.

We do not collect any personal information about you other than personal information which you expressly choose to submit to us directly or through our service providers, such as our telemarketers.

**How we use the information we collect**

We use the information collected from us and/or our services providers (e.g. our telemarketers) to contact and correspond with you, to respond to your inquiries, to improve our website, to target advertisements or other content on the website to products or services that may be of interest to you, to offer media products you request, or as otherwise permitted by law. We may also use information we collect to analyze user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of our websites, and may disclose such analyses to advertisers or other third parties in the form of aggregate data, such as overall patterns or demographic reports that do not describe or identify any individual user.

We may disclose personal information about you to third parties: (i) if we have a good-faith belief that we are permitted or required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) to service providers who require access to such information for the carrying out of their mandate, (iii) to respond to legal claims, (iv) to protect our rights, property or safety or the rights, property or safety of others, or (v) to the resulting organization if we are involved in a merger or other reorganization.

**User-provided information and other parties**

If you post information on our websites, or disclose it to any other party through any of our websites, you should be aware that your information may then be made available to others.

The websites may contain links to other websites or internet resources. When you click on one of those links, you are contacting another website or internet resource that may collect information about you voluntarily or through cookies or other technologies. We have no responsibility or liability for or control over those other websites or internet resources or their collection, use and disclosure of your personal information.

**Storing and securing your personal information**

We will store your personal information at a U.S.-based server, accessible from our headquarters at 2135 Point Blvd., Elgin, IL 60123 as well as other locations for the company. Your information may be subject to foreign laws and accessible to foreign governments, tribunals, law enforcement and regulatory agencies. To help protect the confidentiality of your personal information, we employ security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information and we limit access to your personal information solely to those employees, representatives and agents who require such information for the fulfillment of their functions and/or the carrying out of their mandates.

**Right to access and/or correct personal information**

Each of those provisions also applies to any disputes that may arise in relation to this policy and the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information, and are of the same force and effect as if they had been reproduced directly in this policy.

We reserve the right to change or update this policy, or any other policies or practices, at any time, at our sole discretion, without notice or liability to you or any other person. Any changes or updates will be effective immediately upon posting to any of the websites.
