**Does TheHealthCast® disclose any personally identifiable information it collects from its visitors to outside parties?**

TheHealthCast® may transfer and otherwise share the information you provide to us available to select partners and third parties.

**TheHealthCast®‘s special note to parents**

In compliance with the 1998 Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), TheHealthCast® is a general audience website, and does not knowingly collect, nor will ever knowingly retain, personally identifiable information from any visitor TheHealthCast® actually knows to be under thirteen years of age without the consent of that child’s parent or legal guardian.

**Third party links and co-brand relationships**

In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, TheHealthCast® may choose various third party websites to link to and from, and frame within, its own website. TheHealthCast® may also participate in co-branding and other relationships to offer information, programs and other services and features to its users. However, even if the third party is affiliated with TheHealthCast®, TheHealthCast® has no control over these linked sites, and each of these sites has separate privacy and data collection practices independent of TheHealthCast®. As such, we have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions, and are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any such websites. These linked sites are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk. Accordingly, please carefully review the data collection policies on each of these websites.

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what limited circumstances we disclose it. Continued access or use of the website shall constitute your express acceptance of any modifications to this Privacy Statement. In the event that TheHealthCast® or a substantial portion of TheHealthCast®‘s assets are acquired, customer information collected and retained in accordance with this Privacy Statement may be one of the transferred assets.
