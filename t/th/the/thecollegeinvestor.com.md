 **Privacy Policy**

Your privacy is critically important to us.  At The College Investor we have a few fundamental principles:

  * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
  * We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  * We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
  * In our blogging products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.



### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, The College Investor collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. The College Investor’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how The College Investor’s visitors use its website. From time to time, The College Investor may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

The College Investor also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on The College Investor’s blogs. The College Investor only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to The College Investor’s websites choose to interact with The College Investor in ways that require The College Investor to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that The College Investor gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, The College Investor collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with The College Investor. The College Investor does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

The College Investor discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on The College Investor’s behalf or to provide services available at The College Investor’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using The College Investor’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. The College Investor will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, The College Investor discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when The College Investor believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of The College Investor, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an The College Investor website and have supplied your email address, The College Investor may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with The College Investor and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. The College Investor takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
