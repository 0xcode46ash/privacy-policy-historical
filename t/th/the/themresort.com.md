We do not collect personally identifiable information about visitors except when visitors specifically provide such information on a voluntary basis. Such personally identifiable information may be gathered in registrations, applications, information requests, reservations, rsvps, online purchases, online surveys, and in some instances in the process of utilizing offers from our third party strategic partners and alliances. 

We may use personally identifiable information for the following general purposes: contacting an account holder regarding account status, changes to the account agreement, special discounts, promotions, products offered and other matters relevant to the service and/or the information collected.

In other cases we will use the identifying information as a vehicle for responding to an individual question or comment. 

Collection of Aggregated Information Survey participants are anonymous unless otherwise stated in the survey. We reserve the right to perform statistical analyses of visitors’ behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the website.
