# M Resort

At M Resort, we are aware of your concerns about privacy. We have implemented policies and procedures to ensure that your personal information is handled safely and with the utmost responsibility. The following Privacy Policy outlines the type of information M Resort will collect and how it will be used. These procedures apply to only M Resort. In the event additional properties are included, this Privacy Policy will be updated to include those web sites.

Collection of Information  
As appropriate, M Resort may collect personally identifiable information from you voluntarily to provide you with a particular service. We may ask you for your information such as name, address, telephone number and e-mail address.

Cookies  
A cookie is a small file stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Cookies also measure usage of various pages on our website to help us make our information more pertinent to your needs and easy for you to access, and they provide functionality that we believe would be of interest and value to you.

You may set your browser to block cookies (consult the instructions for your particular browser on how to do this), although doing so will adversely affect your ability to perform certain transactions, use certain functionality and access certain content on our website.

Browsing  
We do not collect personally identifiable information from your computer when you browse this website and request pages from our servers. Unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide us with personally identifiable information, we will not know your name, your e-mail address, or any other personally identifiable information. When you request a page from our web site, our servers log the information provided in the HTTP request header including the IP number, the time of the request, the URL of your request and other information that is provided in the HTTP header.

Security and Storage  
The M Resort Web Site and all personal and general information that reaches M Resort is stored on secure servers generally located in the United States. Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our hotel and other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements. Conversely, the United States may not require a level of privacy protection as great as that offered in other jurisdictions. M Resort makes no representation that this privacy policy complies with requirements outside the United States. While M Resort will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to maintain the security of personal information that you may furnish to us, such disclosure is at your own risk.

Sharing of Information  
M Resort may share your personal information with our properties, affiliates and select third parties as we deem appropriate. Your personal information may also be disclosed if necessary to: (1) enforce our Web Site Agreement; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of M Resort; (3) comply with a court order or other legal process or other legal requirements of any governmental authorities, including but not limited to authorities that regulate gaming activities; or (4) governmental authorities, in the sole discretion of M Resort, in exceptional circumstances, such as a national emergency, security concern, or other situation in which M Resort deems such disclosure prudent.

M Resort uses the services of third parties, such as e-mail service providers and marketing companies that act on behalf of M Resort. These parties are contractually prohibited from using personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for the purpose M Resort specifies. We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us. We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal information to entities outside of the M Resort family of companies for use without your approval.

Special Offer/Promotions E-Mails & Opt Out  
It is our intention to send you only e-mail communications that will be useful to you and that you want to receive. These communications will relate to M Resort offers and/or the promotions of select, reputable third parties with whom M Resort has a strategic marketing relationship because they offer products or services that we believe would be of interest to you. We use a third party e-mail service provider to send e-mails. This service provider is prohibited from using your e-mail address for any purpose other than to send M Resort related e-mail. When you receive an e-mail, you will be provided the choice to opt-out of future e-mails by following the instructions provided in the e-mail.

The Children's Online Privacy Act  
M Resort does not knowingly or intentionally collect any personally identifiable information from, or market to or target, individuals under the age of 21. Pursuant to law, persons under the age of 21 are not permitted to gamble at our properties or loiter in casino areas. Similarly, our website is not intended for persons under the age of 21.

Use of Third party Internet Sites  
Third party Internet sites and services accessible through M Resort have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent from us. M Resort has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions.

Privacy Statement Changes  
In the future, we may need to change this privacy statement. All changes will be posted here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
