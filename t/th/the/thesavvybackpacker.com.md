## Advertising/Privacy Policy

I respect my readers, and I believe in honesty and complete transparency. That said, I do earn a small commission (between 1%-5%) when someone purchases a product/service through one of my referral links. This helps cover the costs to run this website, and all other profits are put towards further travels (and maybe the occasional beer).  
I NEVER recommend any product/service that I don’t believe in. I will always suggest the best/cheapest option even if it results in no financial gain. This issue is very important to me.

If you are interested in advertising with us or have any questions please send an email to savvybackpacker [at] gmail.com

I will only accept advertisements for companies I believe to be worthwhile to my readers.
