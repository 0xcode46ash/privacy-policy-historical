# Advertising/Privacy Policy

## **For Advertisers**

The Savvy Backpacker is quickly becoming the premier resource for student and budget backpackers.

Feel free to email The Savvy Backpacker at savvybackpacker [at] gmail.com if you’re interested in setting up an advertising partnership with us.

Be aware, I NEVER recommend any product/service that I don’t believe in and I will only accept advertisements for companies I believe to be worthwhile to my readers.

##  **For Our Readers**

I respect my readers, and I believe in honesty and complete transparency. That said, I do earn a small commission (between 1%-5%) when someone purchases a product/service through one of my referral links. This helps cover the costs to run this website, and all other profits are put towards further travels (and maybe the occasional beer).

I NEVER recommend any product/service that I don’t believe in. I will always suggest the best/cheapest option even if it results in no financial gain. This issue is very important to me. Do be aware that many (not all) of the products that I review on this site are provided to me for free by the manufacturer. **I don’t  receive any monetary payment for the reviews.** Since I’m not able to afford these products myself I feel this is a fair system, and it allows me to give my honest review of products that I believe my readers will enjoy.
