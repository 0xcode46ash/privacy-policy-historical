The Superficial is a brutally honest look at society and its obsession with the superficial. It is not satire. It is not social commentary. It is the voice of our society at its worst. It is first impressions without sense of social obligation. It is the truth of our generation. It is ugly racism. It is jealousy. It is honest.

Just kidding. Our goal is to make fun of as many people as possible.  


The Superficial is always looking for new things to scrutinize, whether it be the latest celeb of the moment or the current internet goober. We respect our readers' anonymity as much as we love our own and we highly encourage reader submissions. First hand accounts of celebrity encounters or a snotty friend's blog are all things we're interested in. The more superficial the better. You can send us stuff through our [submit page](https://web.archive.org/web/20050622075433id_/http%3A//www.thesuperficial.com/archives/submit.php) or you can email us at [contact@thesuperficial.com](mailto:contact@thesuperficial.com).
