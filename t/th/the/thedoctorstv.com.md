**TYPES OF INFORMATION THAT MAY BE COLLECTED**

The following are the types of information we may collect:

**Information You Provide Us**

We may ask you to provide us with information when you register or otherwise interact with the Web Site, including: (1) personal information, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally, such as your name, e-mail address, cell phone number and physical address ("Personal Information"); and (2) demographic or other information, such as gender, zip code, information regarding your education or number of children, your interests or similar information. We may collect this information at various places and forms on the Web Site. If we combine demographic or other non-personal information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information in those circumstances. You may also be asked to choose a user name and password in order to identify yourself during future visits to the Web Site, and in those cases, please do not use your real name or the name of any other actual person as your user name. Providing us with information about yourself is your choice, and you can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Web Site's features.

 **Information from Other Sources**

We may receive information about you from other sources; for example, we may receive information from a marketing partner in connection with a co-branded web site or promotion. We may use this information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you and to tailor content and ads we serve to you. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Web Site. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any Personal Information received, unless otherwise specifically disclosed by us at the time you provide your Personal Information.

 **Information We Collect As You Access And Use The Web Site (including Do Not Track)**

We may receive and store certain types of web site usage information whenever you visit or interact with the Web Site. For example, we and our third party service providers may collect the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other similar information. We may also collect your IP address or some other unique identifier for the particular device you use to access the Internet, as applicable (collectively referred to herein as a "Device Identifier"). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer, your cell phone, or other device used to access the Internet (each, a "Device"), and our computers identify your device by its Device Identifier. When analyzed, web site usage information helps us determine how our site is used, such as what types of visitors arrive at the Web Site, and what type of content is most popular. We may associate your Device Identifier or web site usage information with the Personal Information you provide, but we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.

Web site usage information may be collected using various methods, such as the following:

 **Cookies**

The Web Site uses standard technology called "cookies," which are small data files that are transferred to your Device when you visit the Web Site if your browser is set to accept cookies. Cookies automatically identify your web browser to the Web Site whenever you visit the Web Site, and may make navigating and using the Web Site easier for you and allow you to personalize your experience on the Web Site. If you do not want to allow information to be collected through the use of cookies, you can generally opt out of providing this information by setting your browser to reject cookies. However, please be aware that some areas of the Web Site may not provide you with an acceptable user experience if you have disabled the use of cookies.

 **Web Beacons**

The Web Site and any communications sent by the Web Site may contain electronic images (generally, single-pixel ".gif" images) called "web beacons." These web beacons allow Company and third parties to monitor and collect certain information about the viewer of the web page, web-based document, e-mail message, or other communication, such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the Device Identifier of the Device that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed.

**Embedded Scripts**

An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Web Site, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our Web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Web Site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

 **How We Respond To Do Not Track Signals**

Some Internet browsers include the ability to transmit "Do Not Track" signals. Since uniform standards for "Do Not Track" signals have not been adopted, this Web Site does not process or respond to "Do Not Track" signals. To learn more about "Do Not Track," please visit "All About Do Not Track" at [http://www.allaboutdnt.com/](https://web.archive.org/web/20141220104613id_/http%3A//www.thedoctorstv.com/http//www.allaboutdnt.com/ "http//www.allaboutdnt.com/").

  
**IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING PUBLIC AREAS OF THE WEB SITE AND USER CONTENT**

The Web Site may provide features that allow or enable you to create a public profile that includes information such as your photo, username, city/state and other information that you choose to post publicly (" **Profile** "). These features may be offered and controlled by a third party and you may need to create an account with a third party or sign-in with your log-in credentials with another service (such as Facebook or Twitter) in order to participate. 

The Web Site may contain public areas to which you can contribute your original text and audio or video content, such as comments, message boards, blog comments areas, personal blog, online chat features, and any public portion of your Profile (collectively, " **Public Areas** ").

If you submit comments, message board posts, blog comments, votes, reviews, suggestions, chat messages, photographs, videos, audio recordings, music, text or other content (" **User Content** ") to Public Areas, **it may be published online or offline in any media or format (currently existing or later developed)**. Note that comment and review features, as well as other Public Areas, may be offered and controlled by third parties. Other users of the Web Site will have access to your User Content that is posted on the Web Site and may have the ability to share it with third parties across the Internet, including through the use of Web Site features allowing users to share links to User Content with third party web sites (such as Blogger, Facebook, Twitter and similar sites). **Company may use your User Content, or any portion of your User Content, that you submit to be published on the Web Site, whether directly to us or through a third party, for advertising, marketing, publicity and promotional activities. For the full terms and conditions regarding User Content you submit to the Web Site, please review the Web Site's[Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use "Terms of Use") **.

If you submit any User Content to Company or to a third party offering features on the Web Site, including comments, message board posts, blog comments, votes, reviews, suggestions, chat messages, photographs, videos may be published online or offline (including, without limitation, on The Doctors Show, on a CD or DVD, or any other electronic or non-electronic media or format currently existing or later developed), we and our service providers, as well as any third party to whom you submit the User Content, may publish your name, voice, likeness and other Personal Information in connection with publishing the User Content or any portion thereof, and may use the User Content and any excerpt thereof in connection with advertising, marketing, publicity and promotional activities.

Please note that Company cannot ensure the security of any information you choose to make public and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy. Therefore, use caution when including Personal Information in User Content or a Public Area or any message that you send using the Web Site (for example, do not post your real name, e-mail address, phone number or physical address).

 **SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICES/INTEGRATION WITH THIRD PARTY PLATFORMS**

The Web Site may permit you to interact with a third party site or service, such as enabling you to "like" us on another site or "share" content with other sites (a "Social Networking Service"). If you choose to "like" or "share" content or to otherwise post information from or via the Web Site to a Social Networking Service, that information may be publicly displayed, and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Web Site. Similarly, if you interact with us through a Social Networking Service, we may have access to information about you (for example, if you "like" or "follow" our page on a third party site). Please note that if you mention or comment upon The Doctors or the Web Site in your post to a third party platform, the third party platform may allow us to publish your post on the Web Site.

You may also choose to use a social media tool offered by a third party, but available on the Web Site (such as posting a review or logging into the Web Site or a third party service with you username and password for another site). Use of such a feature may allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including personal information. When you choose to use a social media tool available on the Web Site, you may be opting to link your activities on the Web Site with a third party site or service. That third party may collect information about your visits to the Web Site and may publish that activity to your profile or similar feature on that third party site. The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party's privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and you choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third party site.

 **THIRD-PARTY AD SERVING AND AUDIENCE AND TRAFFIC MEASUREMENT SERVICES**

The Web Site may use third party network advertisers to serve advertisements on the Web Site and may use a traffic measurement service to analyze traffic on the Web Site. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to the Web Site and other web sites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. These third parties include advertisers, advertising agencies, and ad networks that may collect information about you when you view or interact with one of their advertisements and may collect information about your online activities over time and across different Web sites. Third parties may serve, track and/or analyze ads on our Web Site, and thereby may collect information about your online activities. Some of these parties may collect personal information when you visit the Web Site or other online websites and services. The network advertisers, analytics companies, advertising agencies and similar companies operating on the Web may set and access their own tracking technologies on your device (including cookies and web beacons), and may use that information to show you targeted advertisements.

While we may use a variety of service providers to perform advertising services, some of these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") or the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You may want to visit [http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ "http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/"), which provides information regarding targeted advertising and the "opt-out" procedures of NAI members. You may also want to visit <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>, which provides information regarding targeted advertising and offers an "opt-out" by participating companies in the DAA Self-Regulatory Program. Please note that opting out through these mechanisms does not opt you out of being served advertising, and you will continue to receive generic ads while online.

When you are on the Web Site you may be directed to other sites that are operated and controlled by third parties that are beyond our control. For example, if you “click” through a link in a video player embedded on the Web Site, the “click” may take you off the Web Site onto a third party web site. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use the Web Site’s logo as part of a co-branding agreement. In addition, certain content you see on the Web Site may be offered or hosted and served by third parties. These third parties may set their own cookies on your browser, independently collect data or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If you visit a web site or use any service that is linked or available from our Web Site, you should consult the privacy policy of the web site/service operator before providing any Personal Information. Company is not responsible for the privacy practices employed by any third party.

**CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS – YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS**

Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California have the right to request certain information from companies conducting business in California relating to third parties to which the company has disclosed certain categories of personal information during the preceding year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.

If you do not opt-in or if you choose to opt-out at the time Company offers that choice, Company does not share your information with that identified third party for its direct marketing purposes.
