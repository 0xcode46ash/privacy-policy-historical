##### What Are Cookies and How Do We Use Them?

A "cookie" is information that is transferred from a web site's server to your computer's browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. This information is then available to the web site's server when you return to that site using the same browser. This information can be used to identify the user of the browser visiting the site and record, for example, preferences, purchase and use in general. Most major web sites use cookies to customize the on-line experience based on an individual's interests and preferences and in order to streamline transactions by recording frequently entered information. 

Theatermania.com uses cookies to assess which parts of our web site are popular and which are not. Our updates to the web site will depend in part on data compiled from our use of cookies, such as total numbers of visitors, pages viewed and other traffic patterns. 

Theatermania.com also uses cookies from the [Google Display Network](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/117120). We use this service to determine the aggregate demographic and interests of our site visitors. Using the [Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads) panel, users can opt-out of sending their information to Google. 

Theatermania.com does not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. You may also receive cookies sent by our advertisers, which is a standard practice for on-line advertisers. In most cases, if you choose, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or alert you to their transfer to your browser. 

##### How is My Information Used?

Theatermania.com currently uses personal information only for the purposes of providing newsletter subscription services and recording sweepstakes entries and commercial transactions. In certain cases, you may provide us with credit card information in order to complete a purchase transaction or for verification purposes. We use and transmit this information only to the extent necessary to complete such transactions and only in an encrypted format, unless otherwise expressly noted. 

We currently do not provide your personal information to third parties. We do however reserve the right to provide e-mail addresses of our users to our advertisers, sponsors or business partners, in order to provide our users with information and promotions we believe may be of interest to them. Theatermania.com offers the opportunity to each of its registered users to be excluded from such distributions by e-mailing us at [**info@theatermania.com**](mailto:info@theatermania.com) and including "Privacy" in the subject line. 

##### Maintaining the Privacy of Children

Theatermania.com has developed the "Kids' Mania" section of our web site to publish editorial content produced by and for children. Nonetheless, Theatermania.com encourages parents and guardians to review in advance the appropriateness of the different areas of our web site for their children. 

As discussed above, Theatermania.com may collect information from individuals visiting its web site who may, among other ways, register for a service or enter a sweepstakes or contest. Theatermania.com will not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. Therefore, these visitors may not be eligible to participate in certain services, sweepstakes, contests or transactions, among other things. It is Theatermania.com's intention not to participate in the transfer of any personal information of persons under the age of thirteen for any purpose. 

##### A General Reminder
