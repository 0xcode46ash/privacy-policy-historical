We (being William Reed Publishing Ltd or William Reed Hospitality Ltd as the case may be) take the privacy of all our users and customers seriously and take great care with information they provide. This Privacy Policy outlines how we may use your personal information and forms part of the [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20070726015546id_/http%3A//www.thegrocer.co.uk/groc_tandc.aspx ""Terms") of this site. In future we may have occasion to modify our Privacy Policy, which was last revised on 1st May 2007, and any modifications will be notified on our homepage.

In order to provide our users and customers with a range of services, we may collect personal information from our websites, from telephone responses, from written information sent to us and from other communications. We may for example, keep a record of your name, mailing address, email address and telephone number.

We will at all times comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Act, 1998 and any personal data relating to you will be used and recorded by us in accordance with current legislation and this Privacy Statement.

We may use your personal information to communicate with you, for record keeping purposes, and in aggregate (and therefore anonymously) for market research purposes, to track activity on our web sites, to publish trends or to improve usefulness and content.

Your personal information may be disclosed where we are obliged or permitted by law to do so. We may also share your personal information with other members of the William Reed Group, including William Reed Holdings Ltd, William Reed Publishing Ltd, William Reed Hospitality Ltd and William Reed Knowledge Store Ltd and other companies approved by us. This may involve transferring your information to other parties, inside or outside the EU. When asking you for any personal data, we will give you the opportunity to opt out of these additional uses of your data.

If you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere on our website or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on the website we may use your personal information to stop such behaviour. This may involve informing relevant third parties such as your employer, e-mail/Internet provider and law enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour.

In the unlikely event that this website and the customer data relating to it are sold to another data controller, we will endeavour to ensure that your rights in respect of the processing of your personal data are adequately and appropriately protected.

We reserve the right to pass on your personal information to any law enforcement agencies requesting it in connection with the commission of any offence, once we are reasonably satisfied as to the circumstances surrounding the request.

If our websites contain links to other websites outside the William Reed Group we recommend that you read the privacy statements of any of these websites you visit as we are not responsible for the privacy practices on other sites.

You may not set up links to this web site except to the homepage at [www.thegrocer.co.uk](https://web.archive.org/web/20070726015546id_/http%3A//www.thegrocer.co.uk/%22http://www.thegrocer.co.uk%22 ""www.thegrocer.co.uk"") without our express written permission.

When you visit our website we may send you a cookie, a small file that can be placed on your computerâ€™s hard disc for record keeping purposes which acts as an anonymous identifier when you visit our site. We may use these to tailor the service we provide to you more closely to your needs and/or to collect anonymous statistics about our services where you are not individually identified nor identifiable. You are not obliged to accept a cookie from us, or any other web site, and may modify your browser so that it will not accept them at your discretion, although this means we will not be able to provide you with a personalised service.
