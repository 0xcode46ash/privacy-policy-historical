# Privacy Policy | The Random Forest

As a fellow Internet user myself, I totally respect your online privacy. So it goes without saying that I’m fully committed to safeguarding your online privacy while you’re here at www.therandomforest.com website.

And that’s precisely why I’ve decided to include the following, which discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for this website.

**Privacy Policy**

At TheRandomForest.com, your privacy is important to us. Period.

It is important that you feel comfortable using our site, so we have created this page to provide you with information about our privacy policies. This includes the types of personal information we receive and collect when you visit us, and how we safeguard your information.

First and foremost, please understand that we never sell your personal information to third parties. Typically what we do us look at all the information we collect together to learn how to make the site better for our visitors. Below are some of the types of information we collect.

**Log Files**  
As with most other websites on the internet, we collect and use the data contained in the log files of our servers. The information does not tell us who you are, but it does include your internet protocol (IP) address, your internet service provider (ISP, such as AOL or Time Warner Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site.

**Cookies and Web Beacons**  
We do use a common logging tool called “cookies” to store information. This is how web sites “remember you,” like when they remember your personal preferences when you visit a site repeatedly. This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features, such as forums.

**Third Party Advertisements**  
We also may use third party advertisements to support our site. These ads often come from large reputable companies. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site. When they use these technologies, these advertisers may also receive information about your visit including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash extensions installed.

Again, these are generally large reputable companies. A great example would be Google advertisements through the Google AdSense program. Usually, these companies are using this information for things like geotargeting (this allows them to show Texas plumbing ads to someone in Dallas, for example).

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>

**Interest-Based Advertising**  
It is also possible for these advertising companies to show certain ads based on the specific sites you have visited (such as showing automobile ads to someone who frequents car sites). This “interest-based advertising” allows advertisers to show ads based on a user’s previous interactions with them, such as visits to advertiser website and also to reach users based on their interests (e.g. “sports enthusiast”).

Companies like Google develop interest categories by recognizing the types of web pages users visit throughout the Google content network. As an example, if they visit a number of sports pages, they might add them to the “sports enthusiast” interest category.

**What You Can Do**  
If all of this bothers you, don’t worry. You can easily chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings. Or, you can use the preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, you need to understand that this can affect how you are able to interact with our site (as well as other websites.) This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.
