 **1.  Personal Information**  
We may request "Personal Information" from you, which is information that could be used to contact you or identify you personally (such as your name, street address, telephone number or e-mail address) in connection with your use of, or participation in, membership registration for thenateshow.com, our contests, sweepstakes, promotions, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, content submissions, chats, bulletin boards, discussion groups, requests for suggestions, visitors' requests for free products or services or additional information (including via e-mail to us) and in connection with other activities, services or resources we make available on our Site. The Site may also ask you to provide other information about yourself, such as demographic information (gender, ZIP code, etc.) or certain information about your preferences and interests.  If we combine demographic or other information we collect about you with personal information about you, we will treat the combined information as personal information

We may use personal information and  any non-personal information (including Usage Information) collected through the site to: (1) conduct the feature or activity in connection with which you provided your information; (2) provide you with information or services that you have requested or agreed to receive; (3) process your registration on the Site, including verifying your e-mail address is active and valid; (4) tailor content, advertisements, and offers we serve you; (5) improve the Site and for internal business purposes; (6) contact you with regard to your use of the Site and, in our discretion, changes to the Site policies; and (7) for purposes disclosed to you at the time you provide your personal information or otherwise with your consent.

Please note that information submitted to the Site via a "contact us” or other similar function may not receive a response. We will not use the information provided to contact you for marketing purposes unrelated to your request unless you agree otherwise.

If you use the Site to send a friend an invitation to participate in the Site or send other Site-related communications, the information you provide (typically, names and e-mail addresses) is used on a one-time basis to facilitate the communication on your behalf, and is not used for any other marketing purposes unless we obtain consent from that person.

 **2.  Information We Receive From Third Parties **  
** ** We may receive information about you from various third parties. For example, if you are on another web site and you opt-in to receive information from our Site, that third party web site will forward to us your e-mail address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested. You may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature (such as via Facebook or a similar application or feature via a third party web site) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including personal information. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party web site give us access to their profiles and you are one of their "connections”  or information about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections’”  web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party web site or interactive service.

We may also supplement the information we collect about you through the Site with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. If we combine the information we receive from third parties with information we collect through the Site, we will treat it in accordance with this privacy policy.

**5.  Non-Personal Information**  
 When you visit or interact with the Site, or click on one of our advertisements or our content served on elsewhere on the internet, we and our third-party advertisers and/or service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Site is accessed and used ("Usage Information").  
 We collect Usage Information through the use of, without limitation, the following types of methodology: 

_Cookie technology_ :  
A "cookie" is a data file that a website can send to your Device, which is then stored on your Device. A Flash cookie is data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. Cookies and Flash Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages. If you choose to disable cookies or Flash cookies on your Device, some features of the Site may not function properly. 

_IP Address Tracking_ :  
The Site also automatically collects your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier"), which is a number that is assigned to your computer, mobile device  or other device (collectively, “Device”) that you use to access the Site . When you request pages from our Site, our servers log your Device Identifier. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a web site or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.  Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third-party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the Device used to access the Site.  
  
 _Web Beacons_ :  
A Web beacon, or "clear gif," is a small graphic image on a webpage or web programming code that may be included in the Site and Site e-mail messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Site, to monitor how users navigate the Site, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to determine whether content sent was actually viewed.  
 _ _

_Embedded Scripts_.

An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

Usage Information might include the browser you use, the type of computer you use and technical information about your means of connection to our Site, such as the operating systems and the Internet service providers utilized and other similar information. Our systems may also automatically gather information about the areas of the Site you visit and search terms you use on our Site and about the links you may select from within our Site to other areas of the Web or elsewhere online. 

We use such information for our business purposes and to administer the Site, better manage advertising on the Site and, in the aggregate, to understand how our users as a group use the services and resources provided on our Site. This way, we know which areas of our Site are the favorites of our users, which areas need improvement and what technologies are being used so that we may continually improve our Site.  We may also share this Usage information with our partners, suppliers and other third parties, including third party advertising companies and web analytics providers, as described in the following section. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we treat it as Personal Information.

**6.  Ad Serving And Traffic Measurement Services We May Use**  
We license technology to serve advertisements on the Site as well as within Site widgets and Site content that may be served across the Internet (such as within Site videos). In addition, we may use third party network advertisers to serve advertisements and third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the Site and viewing of our content.  We do not share personal information with these third parties, but ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors, and/or analytics service providers may set and access their own cookies, web beacons and embedded scripts **** on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, including Usage Information.  
With regard to advertisements, we and our network advertisers may target advertisements for products and services in which you might be interested based on your visits to both the Site and other web sites. Cookies, web beacons and embedded scripts, including those set by third party network advertisers, may be used to, among other things, target advertisements, prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. We may share Usage Information about Site visitors with third party advertising companies for the same purposes.  
We may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements. You may wish to visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>, which provides information regarding the "opt-out" procedures of certain third party ad servers we may use.
