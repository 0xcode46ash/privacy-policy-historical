1\. What information does fryeboots.com collect from you, and for what purpose?  
In order to better provide you with products and services, fryeboots.com collects two types of information about its visitors: personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth and customized experience while using thefryecompany.com.

In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are handled by established third party banking, processing agents, and distribution institutions. They receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process and ship your order.

**Personally Identifiable Information**  
This refers to information that let's us know the specifics of who you are. Personal information is requested when you order a product or service, enter contests or sweepstakes, fill out surveys, and send us feedback. For example, this information might include your name, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit/debit card or other payment information, and product details. With this information, we can fill your orders, and better provide you with personalized services.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**  
This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. Fryeboots.com gathers certain information about you based upon where you shop on it in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. For example, this information may include the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the website from which you came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the World Wide Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.

2\. Where does fryeboots.com collect information about you?  
Fryeboots.com gathers information in the following ways:

**Shopping**  
Fryeboots.com collects information from visitors to its site regarding the URLs they came from, domain types (e.g., .com or .org), their IP addresses, the date and time of their visit or order, the number of visits and orders, the number of visits per browsing session, the operating system and browser type used to come to the site, the country, state, and telephone area code where their servers are located, the pages and page titles of its site that visitors viewed during their visit, whether the visitor's computer is enabled for Java or cookies, browser language, applications, and plug-ins, and any search terms entered on thefryecompany.com.   
**  
Ordering**

If you order one of our products or services, thefryecompany.com will collect and maintain your name, e-mail address, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, product selections, credit/debit card or other payment information, order number, referring URL, IP address, page you bought from and a password. It collects this, and other information, as disclosed in this policy, in order to fill your order, to communicate with you about your order, and possibly to send you promotional materials. Before confirming your order, you will have the opportunity to review the product order form and make changes and additions to the information it contained and these changes will be automatically kept for future use.

**Online Surveys and Polling**  
In order to improve our services to you, we may ask some of our customers to voluntarily complete surveys. Individual survey answers are confidential, although only non-personally identifiable information is collected. If you do not wish to participate in a survey, simply decline to participate when asked.

**Contests and Sweepstakes**  
If we should hold a contest or sweepstakes and you opt to enter, thefryecompany.com may ask you for contact information such as your name, address, and e-mail address in order to administer the contest, to send you promotional e-mails, notify winners and make the winners' list publicly available pursuant to applicable laws. Your consent to such promotional use and disclosure of this information is a condition of your participation. As a condition of receiving any prize, you will be required to submit an Affidavit of Eligibility, for us to ensure that you are eligible to receive the prize according to the Contest Rules.

**Newsletters & Promotional E-mails**  
Periodically, we may offer free newsletters, and promotional e-mails as a service to our customers. These newsletters and e-mails will be sent to you via e-mail and will contain information on how to opt out of future newsletters and promotional e-mails.

**Contact Information**  
If you contact our customer service representatives by telephone, e-mail or letter, we may keep a record of your correspondence or comments. If you report a problem with fryeboots.com, we may collect such information in a file specific to you. If you contact us through our feedback area or by calling one of our customer service representatives, we may ask for your name, e-mail address and order information in order to send you a reply.

**Cookies**  
We may use cookies in the operation of fryeboots.com; to find out what cookies are and how they are used, see Section 7 below.

3\. Who is collecting your information, and with whom is it shared?  
Only Jimlar maintains and may use your information. It is not shared with any other third parties with the exception of third party companies such as credit/debit card processing centers, and shipping carriers employed by Jimlar to perform functions on its behalf including order fulfillment, postal and email delivery, and credit processes. The only information shared is that information which is necessary to process your order.  
We reserve the right to disclose your information as required by law, and when we believe disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us.

4\. How can you update or correct your personally identifiable information?  
You have the ability to access and edit the personal information that you have provided to thefryecompany.com. During the online ordering process you can review, change, or delete the information that you have submitted. You may change any of your personal information in your account online at any time. We encourage you to promptly update your information if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past purchases, you cannot delete information associated with past purchases. Also, as a security measure we "back up" the data stored on our systems, and such prior information cannot be completely removed from our databases. As a result, you should not expect that all of your personally identifiable information will be completely removed from our backed-up databases.

5\. What are your choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of your information?  
We may from time to time send you e-mail or other communications regarding current promotions, specials, and new additions to thefryecompany.com. You may "opt-out," or unsubscribe from our newsletters by following the unsubscribe instructions in any e-mail you receive from us, or by sending an e-mail to [Frye-Privacy@thefryecompany.com](mailto:Frye-Privacy@thefryecompany.com). After doing so, you will not receive future promotional emails unless they open a new account, enter a contest, or sign up to receive newsletters or emails. Please allow up to 2 weeks to process your request.

6\. What security precautions are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information?  
When you access your account information, the information is kept on a secure server. All of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access by physical security means.

7\. What are "Cookies", and how are they used?  
When you use fryeboots.com, it may store cookies on your computer in order to facilitate and customize your use. A cookie is a small data text file, which a website stores on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to fryeboots.com.

The cookies make your use of thefryecompany.com easier, allow you to retrieve an earlier shopping cart, make thefryecompany.com run more smoothly and help us to maintain a secure site. You will be unable to shop on thefryecompany.com without your browser set to accept cookies.
