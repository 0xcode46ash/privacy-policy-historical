# TheProxyFree: Visit websites via an anonymous proxy, bypass the firewall of your institution

  


TheProxyFree.com is a free (yes it is 100% free) web based [anonymous proxy ](http://theproxyguide.com/proxy)service which allows you to visit websites through an anonymous web server so that you can visit sites that are blocked by your company, school, university or your ISP. 

In addtion, our service will protect you privacy and may keep you away from spy-ware and virus. There is NO software to install. Just enter a website address in the form in the homepage to begin your anonymous surfing. Check our [Proxy Blog](http://blog.theproxyfree.com/) on TheProxyFree updates and web proxy discussions. 

**New functions: now you can use https connections (e.g., MySpace, Gmail....)

By using our services, you accept our [terms ](http://theproxyfree.com/terms.php) and [privacy policy](http://theproxyfree.com/privacy.php).
