We discuss the definitions of the various indicators and provide information about the ways in which one can interpret them. See for example, data for the [U.S. economic indicators](http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/USA/)

You can compare many economic indicators across countries and track their changes over time. The comparisons are linked to the lectures in our guide to give you insight into the nature of each indicator. Make an [international comparison](http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/compare-countries/).
