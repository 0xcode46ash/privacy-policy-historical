## Privacy Policy

### Introduction

The Perfume Shop Limited (“we”, “us” or “our”) is a Data Controller for the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998 (registration number: Z6128767). We will use the personal information you provide, on your behalf, for the purposes set out below. We are committed to protecting your privacy.   
Please read this policy carefully as it explains how we use your personal information. If you have any questions about or comments on this policy, please contact us on 0800 98 88 660* before using www.theperfumeshop.com (“website”).

We may change this policy from time to time by updating this page. You should check this page from time to time to ensure you are happy with any changes. 

### What information do we collect and why?

In general, you can visit our website without giving us any information and we won’t know who you are. If you are one of our anonymous visitors, please bear in mind that we may still:

  * Record the areas of the website which you visit; and
  * Collect information about your computer such as which browser you are using, your network location, the type of connection you are using (e.g. broadband, ADSL etc).



We do this by using Cookies, but we can’t tell who you are.

Additional services may be available if you register with our website (including if you register for our Rewards Club). In this case, once you register we will know who you are, and your activities on our website and information about your computer may be linked to you on our systems. You may also give us:

  * Contact information - your name, address, postcode, email address and telephone/mobile number;
  * General information about you - your interests, experiences with products and services and your contact preferences;
  * If you are registering as a Rewards Club member, information to help us send you the promotions that we think fit you the best including your favourite products, hobbies, your birthday and family members (for example, children’s names and birthdays).



The main reason we use this information is to provide you with our products and services (whether available via the website or offline).

If you have opted-in to receive marketing from us then we will also use this information to send you communications (including extra point’s promotions if you’re a Rewards Club member). These will all be sent by The Perfume Shop but may contain offers and information from other companies that we think you may be interested in, including from our sister company Superdrug Stores plc. Rest assured, we will never share your details with other companies to let them send you their marketing directly. For more information on our marketing activities, see our Privacy Promise at the end of this policy.

We may keep copies of any correspondence you send us including questions, feedback, complaints and any problems you have reported, as well as your registration history with us (including Rewards Club registration), competition submissions and responses to our online questionnaires. This is to allow us to respond to you if appropriate, and for our internal record keeping and product development. 

Finally we may also use your information for market research and analysis purposes, but this will be on an anonymous basis (so no one will know who you are).

### Who do we share this information with?

We may share your information with:

  * Companies performing services on our behalf (such as marketing agents, recruitment agents and service providers such as our website host) who will only use the information to provide that service to us. These organisations may provide services to us from other countries, which may mean that personal information is transferred to those other countries;
  * Other members of our corporate group (the A S Watson group of companies) for market analysis purposes (but only on an anonymous basis);
  * A purchaser or potential purchaser of our business or assets;
  * Organisations which we need to share information with either for legal reasons, to prevent or investigate criminal activity, or to protect our or our customers’ rights (for example the police, the courts, fraud investigation organisations, insurers, solicitors, auditors and financial advisors); and
  * Credit checking organisations.



### How to get copies of or amend the information we have collected

You may request details of personal information which we hold about you under the Data Protection Act 1998. We may charge a small fee for this (which will be no more than £10). If you would like a copy of the personal information we hold about you please write to Customer Services, Cypress House, The Gateway Centre, Coronation Road, Cressex Business Park, High Wycombe, HP12 3SU.

If you need to update any details relating to your Rewards Club registration then you can either update them online at www.theperfumeshop.com, or by calling Customer Services on 0800 98 88 660*. If you think any other information we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, please call us on 0800 98 88 660 as soon as possible so we can correct or update your information.

### Security

We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. To prevent unauthorised access or disclosure we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect about you.

We may link to other websites which are not within our control (including for example, the website of our sister company Superdrug Stores plc). Once you have left our website, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement for the website you’re visiting.

### Cookies

They are used to ensure that items are placed and remain in your Shopping Basket and that orders are processed correctly. Cookies make it easier for you to maintain your preferences on the website, and by seeing how you use our website we can try and tailor your experience to fit your preferences.

### Phishing

Phishing is the name given to attempts to steal personal details and financial account details from a website user. “Phishers” use fake or “spoof” emails to lead users to counterfeit websites where the user is tricked into entering their personal details, such as credit card numbers, user names and passwords. Please note that The Perfume Shop Limited will never send you emails asking for such details, and our staff will never ask you for your password.

If you do receive an email like this, or are asked for your password by anyone claiming to work for us, please forward the email or report the incident by calling us on 0800 98 88 660* or by writing to us at Customer Services, Cypress House, The Gateway Centre, Coronation Road, Cressex Business Park, High Wycombe, HP12 3SU.

### When you apply for a job with us

When applying for a job with us through our website you will provide information about yourself, such as your CV. We will use this information to assess your suitability for employment by us and in any subsequent interviewing process. 

We will keep copies of the information you submit and any further correspondence in order to progress your job application and as a record of our employment and fair access processes. If you are a successful candidate then we will keep your information for the purpose of your employment with us. We may also keep information about unsuccessful candidates so that we can contact them in the future about other vacancies we think may be of interest.

We sometimes employ external recruitment agents to help with the recruitment process. We will always retain control of your information (including CVs you may submit) and the recruitment agent must act in accordance with our instructions when using that information.

### Our Privacy Promise

If you have registered with us (including as a Rewards Club member) you can receive exclusive offers, bonus points and other promotions. As mentioned before, these will all be sent by The Perfume Shop but may contain offers and information from other companies that we think you may be interested in, including from our sister company Superdrug Stores plc.

Rest assured, we won’t send you these, or any other marketing unless you have given us your consent to do so and we will never share your personal details with other companies to let them send you their marketing directly.

### How to Unsubscribe

You can unsubscribe from receiving any marketing from us at any point using one of two methods:

  * changing your communication preferences on your online account on our website; or
  * via the unsubscribe link that you’ll find at the bottom of every marketing email we send.



Please note that if you unsubscribe from us then you won’t receive any further marketing from The Perfume Shop; however if you have separately given your permission to receive marketing from other companies, for example Superdrug Stores plc, then you will still receive marketing from those companies unless you also unsubscribe from them. Please allow up to 3 working days for your new communication preferences to come into affect.
