If you wish, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time a Cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all Cookies.

### Links to a third party site

Our web site provides links to other web sites. Please be aware that when you click on one of these links, you are going to another web site even though the TheOptionsGuide.com logo or banner may still be visible. Information you enter on these other web sites is being collected by that site, not TheOptionsGuide.com. Please read the privacy statements of these linked sites as their Privacy Policy Statement may differ from ours. TheOptionsGuide.com does not control such sites, and therefore, is not responsible for their contents. TheOptionsGuide.com's inclusion of hyperlinks to these sites does not imply any endorsement of the material on such sites or any association with their operators. While TheOptionsGuide.com strive to protect our visitors' information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you disclose such information at your own risk.

### Is my Personal information Secure?

TheOptionsGuide.com works hard to ensure that our systems are secure and that they meet industry standards. Where appropriate, we employ firewalls, encryption technology, user access codes (e.g., userIDs and passwords to enter account holder areas) and other access control mechanisms to control access to systems and data. Even with these security measures, we cannot guarantee that your communications with our site will never be unlawfully intercepted, or that your personal information will never be unlawfully accessed by third parties. Your password should never be shared with anyone. TheOptionsGuide.com will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited telephone call or e-mail. We will continue to assess new technology to evaluate its ability to provide additional protection of your personal information.
