V. Movoto's Do-Not-Call Policy

Movoto has established and implemented the following written policy and procedures for maintaining a do-not-call list. It is Movoto's intent to honor anyone's do-not-call request in a systematic and timely manner. It is also our intent to fully comply with any and all applicable do-not-call rules as a matter of course in our routine business practices. These rules are generally set forth at sections 64.1200 et seq. of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations pertaining to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991.

Movoto requires our sales staff, affiliated real estate agents and other personnel to read, understand, and strictly adhere to the following rules and procedures:

Checking Company-Specific Do-Not-Call List: Do not initiate any call to any home or cell phone number for the purpose of soliciting business unless you first check client Contact Restrictions on the Movoto client administration tool. There is no exception to this rule for calls made based on written permission, established business relationship, or personal relationship. If you do not have a copy of or access to Movoto-specific do-not-call list, inform Movoto immediately.

Honoring Do-Not-Call Requests: If the purpose of your call is to solicit business, you must refrain from calling anyone's home or cell phone number listed on Movoto do-not-call list. Honor any do-not-call request for five years, unless the person asks to be removed. Do not share Movoto's do-not-call list with anyone outside Movoto.

Verbal or Written Do-Not-Call Requests: If anyone you speak with over the telephone or in person requests for Movoto to refrain from calling that person or if you receive a do-not-call request by mail, fax, e-mail or any other method, you must immediately update the following information in the Movoto Client Record: (1) the person's name, if provided; (2) the person's home and/or cell phone number(s) to be included in the do-not-call request; (3) the date and time of the do-not-call request; and (4) set "Contact Restrictions" to "Do Not Call This User". Your immediate attention in this matter is essential because Movoto must honor the do-not-call request within a reasonable time, not to exceed 30 days from the date of the request.

Our Affiliated Entities: A do-not-call request applies to Movoto and our affiliated agents for the purposes of Movoto initiated business contact.
