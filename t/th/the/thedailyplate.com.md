Your privacy is important to The Daily Plate ("The Daily Plate", "we" or "us"). This Privacy and Information Security Policy ("the Policy") discusses the personally identifying information ("PII") that we collect about you when you use our website [http://www.thedailyplate.com](http://www.thedailyplate.com/) (the "Site") and the other services we provide on or through the Site (together with the Site, the "Service"). This Policy is part of and incorporated into [The Daily Plate Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/tou) (collectively, the "Terms"). 

Policy highlights: 

  * We will not collect PII about you through the Service unless you disclose such information to us;
  * We will not knowingly disclose PII about you that we collect through the Service to third parties, except under the limited circumstances described in this Policy; and
  * We will take reasonable steps to protect the security of the PII we collect from you through the Service.



These Policy highlights are qualified in full by reference to the terms described below. 

**BY PROVIDING PII OR OTHER INFORMATION TO US OR BY USING OUR SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO THIS POLICY AND THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THE POLICY.**

 **1.** ** _INFORMATION YOU GIVE US_**. 

a. 

_The Types of Information The Daily Plate Collects_

. We collect any information you enter on the Service or give us in any other way (such as through an email, survey, or letter). The information that we collect varies depending upon how you use our Service. Our account registration process requires that you provide us with your user name, birthday and email address, and that you create and provide us with a password. We may also request other information, such as but not limited to, your actual first and last name, gender, and zip code. You may access and update certain of your personal information or account settings by going to the "Profile" tab on the Site. 

b. 

_Information in Public Areas of the Site_

. Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily provide information in public areas of the Service, such as the user profile pages or forums, that information can be viewed and possibly used by others. We therefore advise visitors not to disclose contact information, including phone number, email address, street address or instant messenger address (within these public areas) that they do not wish to share. We are not responsible for PII you choose to submit in these public areas. Also, we may highlight content you post to the public areas of the Service such as reviews or comments, such as by featuring your content on the Site’s home page. 

c. 

_Minors_

. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, do not attempt to register for our Site or send any information about yourself to us. We recommend that prospective users between the ages of 13 and 17 ask their parents or other legal guardians for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.
