When you want to participate in activities on our web site, this is the sort of information we ask for and how we use it: 

  * If you enter any competitions hosted on the website, we ask you for your name and email. If you win, we ask you for your residential address. This is so that we can let you know if you have won anything, send you your prize and let other people (such as other users of our web site, the public and our own employees) know about our competitions and their winners.
  * If you register to be sent information about our authors, books and so forth, we will ask you for your name, contact and demographic details.

We use cookies to see how often people visit our website and what they look at. This helps us to know what parts of the website are popular - what people are interested in - so we can make sure we have more interesting material on the website in future. If you don't want us to be able to do this, your browser's help section should be able to tell you how you can disable or filter cookies and how to arrange for your browser to tell you when you've been sent a new cookie.
