This Privacy Policy describes the information that Score Media Ventures Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates ("we," "our" or "us") collect through websites that we operate and any mobile application of ours (each, an "App") (collectively, the "Service"), how we use, disclose and protect your information and the choices you can make about your information. 

## 1\. CONSENT

When acting on our behalf, such service providers are only authorized to collect, use, disclose or store personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. However, the government, courts, law enforcement, security, or regulatory agencies of a particular country may be able to obtain access to or disclosure of personal information as permitted by the laws of that country. 

Any questions in this regard may be directed to the Privacy Compliance Officer using the contact information provided below. 

## 2\. HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION

We collect the following types of information as follows: 

**a. Information you provide us directly:** We may ask for certain information such as your name, postal address, email address, telephone number, password, third party social networking service user name or user ID and password and other information to use the Service, or if you contact or interact with us. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may retain other information you voluntarily provide us with including your comments and other content. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service, and as further detailed below. 

**b. Information we may collect receive from third parties:** We may receive information about you from third parties including third party social networking services. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service. We also may collect information about you from third party business partners, publicly available sources and our subsidiaries and affiliates. 

**c. Analytics information.** We may directly collect information or we or our third party business partners may use analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. Please visit [http://www.thescore.com/pages/manage-analytics-and-ads-preferences](https://web.archive.org/pages/manage-analytics-and-ads-preferences) for additional information about how you can manage preferences regarding analytics information. 

**d. Cookies information:** When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your device that uniquely identifies your browser and lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time. A persistent cookie remains on your device after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can set your browser to refuse certain cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is limited or disabled. 

**e. Log file information:** Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a Web page or other content within the Service. We may also receive log information relating to your use of our Apps. When you use the Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, operating system, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. This information is used to monitor, assess, diagnose problems with, and improve the Service. 

**f. Clear gifs/web beacons information:** Clear gifs (also known as web beacons) are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our users. We also may use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. You can disable the ability of clear gifs to track certain information by setting your browser to refuse certain cookies. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service. 

**g. Device identifiers:** When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart phones or tablets), we or our third party business partners may access, assign, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more unique identifiers, such as a universally unique identifier (UUID). Unique identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A unique identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by us. A unique identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A unique identifier may also be used to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. 

**h. Advertising identifiers:** Advertising identifiers are unique strings associated with your mobile device provided by the operating system. Please visit [http://www.thescore.com/pages/manage-analytics-and-ads-preferences](https://web.archive.org/pages/manage-analytics-and-ads-preferences) for additional information about how you can reset advertising identifiers and limit advertising tracking. 

**i. Location data:** When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store "location data," which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Service. Some features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled. 

**j. Commercial and marketing communications:** We use the information we collect or receive to communicate directly with you. We may send you electronic messages containing Service-related notices (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, feature notifications, technical and security notices). We may also send you electronic messages containing promotions and special offers. You can also stop receiving electronic messages (other than Service-related notices) from us by clicking on the "unsubscribe link" provided in such communications or by changing your account preferences or settings. 

**k. Use of certain service type information we collect:** We use or may use cookies, log files, unique identifiers, advertising identifiers, location data and clear gifs information to: (i) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Service, (ii) provide personalized content and information, (iii) provide and monitor the effectiveness of the Service; (iv) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns, (v) diagnose or fix technology problems, (vi) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in, (vii) provide targeted advertising to your browser or device, (viii) automatically update our App on your mobile devices, (ix) allow you to comment on or provide content and participate in contests or promotions and (x) conduct research or surveys.

We may share information about you that they need to perform their functions. We will use contractual or other means to protect personal information disclosed to such third parties. We may also share your information with any subsidiary or affiliate of ours for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. Any subsidiary or affiliate of ours will be required to maintain that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

**b. Who you may choose to share Your Content with; removal of content:** Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as Your Content (as defined in the Terms of Use at [http://www.thescore.com/pages/terms](https://web.archive.org/pages/terms)), becomes available to the public, except as limited by any privacy settings made available on the Service. Subject to your privacy settings, any of Your Content that you voluntarily make public may be searchable by others. If you remove information or content that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other users have copied or saved that information or content. If you are a California resident under age 18 and a registered Service user, you may ask us to remove content or information that you have posted to the Service by emailing us at [privacy@thescore.com](mailto:privacy@thescore.com). Please note that such removal does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information posted (for example, your content or information may remain visible because it was copied and posted or reposted by a third party). 

**c. What happens in the event of a business change:** If we become involved in a merger, consolidation, acquisition, sale of assets, joint venture, securities offering, bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, or other transaction or if the ownership of all or substantially all of our business otherwise changes, we may share or transfer your information to a third party or parties in connection therewith. 

**d. Instances where we are required to share your information:** Regardless of the choices you make regarding your information and to the extent permitted or required by applicable law, we may disclose information about you to third parties to: (i) enforce or apply the Terms of Use or any applicable end user license agreement; (ii) comply with law, in response to subpoenas, warrants, or court orders, or in connection with any legal process or cooperate with government or law enforcement officials or private parties; (iii) protect our rights, reputation, safety and property, or that of our users or others; (iv) protect against legal liability; (v) establish or exercise our rights to defend against legal claims or (vi) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected illegal activities, suspected fraud, the rights, reputation, safety or property of us, users or others, violation of the Terms of Use, our policies or agreements or as otherwise required by law. 

**e. Sharing certain service type information we collect about you:** We may share certain service type information, including information obtained through tools such as cookies, log files, unique identifiers, advertising identifiers, location data and clear gifs (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with our third party business partners for the purposes described in the section above on "How We Collect and Use Information." We may also aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally identifying characteristics and may share that aggregated, anonymized data with third parties. 

**f. Ads on the Service:** We may also share certain information such as your location, browser and cookie data, unique identifier data, advertising identifier data and other data relating to your use of our Service with our business partners to deliver advertisements ("ads") that may be of interest to you. We may allow third party ad platforms to serve advertisements on the Service. These third party ad platforms use technology to send, directly to your browser or mobile device, the ads and ad links that appear on the Service, and will automatically receive your Internet Protocol address when they do so. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, unique identifiers, advertising identifiers, location data, and clear gifs, see above) to compile information about your browser's or device's visits and usage patterns on the Service, measure the effectiveness of their ads, and personalize the advertising content. You can opt out of receiving certain cookies by adjusting your browser settings to refuse certain cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed. You can also reset advertising identifiers and limit advertising tracking. (See **"Your Choices About Your Information"** below). 

**We do not sell, rent, or share information about personally identifying characteristics (e.g., name, email address, age, gender) we collect directly from you or about you from third parties with third party ad platforms for their own marketing purposes, unless you choose in advance to have such information shared for this purpose.**

Please note that an advertiser may ask us to show an ad to a certain audience of users (e.g., based on demographics or other interests). In that situation, we determine the target audience and we serve the advertising to that audience and only provide anonymous aggregated data to the advertiser. If you respond to such an ad, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. 

This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers or contact such advertisers for more information. 

## 4\. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION

However, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed. Electronic communications sent to or from the Service may not be secure.
