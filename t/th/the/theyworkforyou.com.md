### What is your cookie policy?

We use cookies to save you from having to repeatedly sign in to the site, and also to remember your postcode. We may also use them to record if you've answered one of the survey questions we ask. The site will work with cookies disabled, but it won't be as good.

### What are these survey questions?

In order to improve the site we're asking some questions to help us understand who uses the site and what they want. The answers are completely anonymous.

### Measuring website usage (Google Analytics)

We use Google Analytics to collect information about how people use this site. We do this to make sure it’s meeting its users’ needs and to understand how we could do it better.

Google Analytics stores information such as what pages you visit, how long you are on the site, how you got here, what you click on, and information about your web browser.

We have also enabled the Advertising Features of Google Analytics. In particular, we use **Demographics and Interest reporting** to identify trends in the types of users visiting our site, which may be used for internal reporting and improvement of the site content.

In technical speak, this allows Google to collect data about your traffic via Google [advertising cookies](http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/types/) and [anonymous identifiers](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-identifier), in addition to data collected through a standard Google Analytics implementation. Regardless of the source of the data, we strictly adhere to [Google’s policy requirements](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2700409) in our treatment of your data. We do not facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information collected through any Google advertising product or feature.
