**The Way We Use Information:**

  
We collect users' IP address and click patterns. This data may be shared with outside parties for consulting and monitoring purposes only. No data is ever sold to outside parties. No information in the form of names, addresses, phone numbers, credit card #s etc is collected.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.
