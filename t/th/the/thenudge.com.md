# Privacy Policy - The Nudge

www.theNudge.com (“the Nudge” or “the Website”) is owned and operated by Framework (London) Ltd (“the Company”, “we” or “us”).

The Company is very protective of its users’ privacy – its aim is to circumvent any concerns you may have regarding privacy through this Policy (as detailed below) and the very simple privacy settings found within each user’s account.

In accessing and using the Nudge, you become a “User” and are therefore agreeing to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, as well as permitting us to collect and use your personal data in the manner detailed below.

##  Personal Data

We consider “Personal Data” to be any information that identifies a User, including both information provided to the Nudge by that User (such as their name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, gender, location) and any information regarding that user’s movements on, and use of, the Nudge.

Personal Data does not include “Grouped Information”, which is information we collect relating to groups of places, products, services, events, online content or customers, from which User identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use the Nudge may be collected and combined with information about how other Users are using it, allowing us to improve the Nudge for everyone.

As a User you may, at any time view or update your Personal Data within your settings tab on the Website.

You may also close your account within that same settings tab and / or request that we delete all Personal Data that we have collected about you. We will promptly fulfill your request and provide you confirmation when the information has been deleted.

##  Cookies

Cookies are small data files that reside on the hard drive of a user’s computer. We use cookies to allow Users of the Nudge to enter the Website without typing in, for example, their email address or password. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you can use the feature in your browser to deny them.

Cookies enable us to understand and use your preferences to improve your experience on the Nudge, as well as allowing us to track user trends and patterns.

When users provide us with registration information (name, email address etc), this data can be matched with cookie data, if cookies have been set to be received. This means that we can match specific users with specific usage of the Nudge. Only we might use this information to improve our service.

Some advertisers may use the cookie technology when they advertise on the Nudge, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through their Google AdSense program) some information including your IP address, your ISP, and the browser used when you visit our site. For example Google uses the DART cookie (which uses “non personally identifiable information” to enable it to send tailored adverts to its users, based on their interests ("interest based targeting"). You can opt out of this by visiting DART Ad-Serving and Search Cookie Opt-Out.

Most browsers accept cookies automatically, though you can set your browser to refuse them. Please note though, that if you do this then the Nudge (and many other websites) may not work as well as they will do with them enabled. 

##  Third Party Websites

The Nudge may contain links to third party websites - we are not responsible for their privacy practices.

##  Security

Your account is password-protected. Please protect your password and don’t share it with anyone else.

We use all possible measures to protect your Personal Data that is stored within our database. If you have any questions about the security at our website, please contact us on info@theNudge.com.

Although we take reasonable measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.

_You acknowledge that the Company cannot be, and therefore is not, responsible for any intercepted information sent via the Internet, and you release us from any and all claims and liability arising out of or related to any unauthorized use of intercepted information._

##  Modifications to this Privacy Policy

By becoming a User, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy as it may be amended from time to time. We may send you a copy of any updates, though recommend that you check back intermittently to view the policy here.
