# Privacy Policy - The Nudge

[www.theNudge.com](http://www.thenudge.com/) (“the Nudge” or “the Website”) is owned and operated by Framework (London) Ltd (“the Company”, “we” or “us”).

The Company is very protective of its users’ privacy – its aim is to circumvent any concerns you may have regarding privacy through both this Policy (as detailed below) and the very simple privacy settings found within each user’s account. There are two user settings – private or public.

In accessing and using the Nudge, you become a “User” and are therefore agreeing to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, as well as permitting us to collect and use your personal data in the manner detailed below.

**Personal Data**

We consider “Personal Data” to be any information that identifies a User, including both information provided to the Nudge by that User (such as their  name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, gender, location) and any information regarding that user’s movements on, and use of, the Nudge.

Personal Data does not include “Grouped Information”, which is information we collect relating to groups of places, products, services, events, online content or customers, from which User identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use the Nudge may be collected and combined with information about how other Users are using it, allowing us to improve the Nudge for everyone. 

If you elect to have a private profile in your settings then only those Users in your network will know which Nudges have been added, specifically, by you. If you elect to have a public profile then any other User will be able to “follow” your Nudges, and so will know which Nudges you have provided, and be able to search them as they can those of any Users within their private network on the Website.  
As a User you may, at any time view or update your Personal Data within your settings tab on the Website. 

You may also close your account within that same settings tab and / or request that we delete all Personal Data that we have collected about you. We will promptly fulfill your request and provide you confirmation when the information has been deleted.

**Listings**

“Listings” or “a Listing” is any place, product, service, event or piece of online content added to the Nudge (by us or by a User) with the main purpose of allowing it to be reviewed and recommended by any and all Users of the Website. Each Listing on the Website is given its own page (a “Listing Page”), where it is described, categorised, and where any reviews for it are added by the Users. ** **

**Nudges**

We define “a Nudge” as an action on the Website, by a User, that demonstrates his or her support or disapproval of any Entity listed on the Website, together with any review and / or photographs, submitted in relation to that same Listing by the User.

While the Nudge has been created to facilitate the sharing of recommendations and reviews between friends, we also – in order to provide compelling content for our Users – show the Nudges of all Users for each Entity on the relevant Listing Page, irrespective of each User’s settings. However, unless a User has chosen – in their account settings – to have a public profile, then only other Users within their private network will know that any given review has been submitted by them: to all other Users of the site their review will be annonymous.

A Nudge that is anonymous still conveys some Personal Data to those who view it: your gender, age and location. In addition if a User who views one of your Nudges is not in your private network, but is connected to a User who is, then you are considered to be in their “extended network” and – as such – this fact will be highlighted to them when they view your Nudge.  We include this information alongside any anonymous Nudges because we don’t feel that they compromise the privacy of the User who has submitted them, but they are of huge benefit to other Users of the Website who are searching for great content and positive feedback, provided by people like them (if they can’t find Nudges by people they know) on particular Listings on the Website. 

By adding a Nudge to the Website you accept that the owner/manager of the Entity that you have reviewed may elect to comment on your Nudge. In doing so you may receive a message in your account notifying you of this fact and giving you an opportunity to enter a dialogue with that Owner – it is your choice whether to reply or not. If you do not, that Owner will have no ability to contact you directly or to continue the dialogue – they will also never have any access to your contact details and, unless you have a public profile, will not even know your name – only your age, location and gender.

We must caution all Users against including any personal information within their Nudges which could lead to that information being collected and used by third parties to contact them, which naturally we have no control over.

**Transferring Nudges and Personal Data**

We may sell and distribute your Nudges together with your Personal Data (excluding your name and email address) to third parties who may display or publish such information. We may disclose information about you and your use of the Nudge if we are required to do so by law, or if we believe that such disclosure is necessary to avoid liability on our part. Should the Nudge be acquired by another party, your Personal Data may be transferred to the acquiror. You will be notified if your Personal Data is so transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

**Cookies**

Cookies are small data files that reside on the hard drive of a user’s computer. We use cookies to allow Users of the Nudge to enter the Website without typing in, for example, their email address or password. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you can use the feature in your browser to deny them. 

Cookies enable us to understand and use your preferences to improve your experience on the Nudge, as well as allowing us to track user trends and patterns.

When users provide us with registration information (name, email address etc), this data can be matched with cookie data, if cookies have been set to be received. This means that we can match specific users with specific usage of the Nudge. Only we might use this information to improve our service.

Some advertisers may use the cookie technology when they advertise on the Nudge, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through their Google AdSense program) some information including your IP address, your ISP, and the browser used when you visit our site. For example Google uses the DART cookie (which uses “non personally identifiable information” to enable it to send tailored adverts to its users, based on their interests ("interest based targeting"). You can opt out of this by visiting [DART Ad-Serving and Search Cookie Opt-Out](http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx).

Most browsers accept cookies automatically, though you can set your browser to refuse them. Please note though, that if you do this then the Nudge (and many other websites) may not work as well as they will do with them enabled. 

**Third Party Websites**

The Nudge may contain links to third party websites - we are not responsible for their privacy practices.

**Security**

Your account is password-protected. Please protect your password and don’t share it with anyone else.

We use all reasonable measures to protect your Personal Data that is stored within our database. If you have any questions about the security at our website, please contact us on info@theNudge.com. 

Although we take reasonable measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.

_You acknowledge that the Company cannot be, and therefore is not, responsible for any intercepted information sent via the Internet, and you release us from any and all claims and liability arising out of or related to any unauthorized use of intercepted information._

**Modifications to this Privacy Policy**

By becoming a User, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy as it may be amended from time to time. We may send you a copy of any updates, though recommend that you check back intermittently to view the policy here.

**Questions**

If you have any questions regarding this policy, please contact Framework (London) Ltd at [info@theNudge.com](mailto:info@thenudge.com)
