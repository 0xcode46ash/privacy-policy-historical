# Privacy Policy — The Coupon Project

This policy is valid from 1 July 2009

Maintaining your privacy is important to me, and it should be to you, too.  This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) outlines how and what information is collected and used by The Coupon Project and its affiliates.  Rest assured, I will never give or sell any information obtained by you on this site to a third-party without your express permission.  Please understand that information you voluntarily post on this site (such as your name, email address, or other personally identifiable information) is at your own risk and not protected under this Policy.  


**Third-Party Affiliations and Advertisers**

This blog is hosted by TypePad, and you are encouraged to read their [Privacy Policy](http://www.typepad.com/legal/privacy-policy.html).  Additionally, this blog is affiliated with third-party advertisers including, but not limited to: Google, Chitika, Logical Media, Brandcaster, and Amazon.com.  Some or all of these advertising partners use cookies that are activated when you view and/or click through ad images.  Cookies are small files of information that uniquely identify your browser.  This information may help advertisers in a number of ways, such as in measuring the effectiveness of their ads, understanding user preferences, and developing future campaigns.  These advertisers may use additional methods for collecting data as well. 

While I have taken care to select reputable advertisers, I am not responsible for methods used by my advertisers.  As a result, I recommend you consult the respective privacy policies of each of these advertisers for additional information about their methods as well as how to opt-out.

**  
Reader Participation**

As a reader, you are invited to participate in this blog in a number of ways, including but not limited to:

**_Commenting._** If you choose to leave a comment, your email address (while required) will not be displayed publicly.  While I will have access to your email address, I will only use it to contact you should I have reason to do so.  I will never give or sell your email address to any third-party without your express permission.  Please remember that information you choose to post will be public and at your own risk; therefore, I caution you to exercise good judgment in choosing which details to share. 

**_Subscribing._** For your convenience, I have activated Google’s Feedburner service so you can receive my posts via a reader or email.  I do not have access to the list of email addresses or subscriber names; that information is maintained solely by Google.  Additionally, I am not notified if you chooseto subscribe or unsubscribe.  You can read Google’s [Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacypolicy.html) for more information. 

**_Emailing._** My email address is found in the “About” section of my blog.  I welcome readers to email me with questions, comments, deals, or other opportunities.  If you email me something I would like to post on my blog, I will ask your permission first.  Personally identifying information (other than a first name, if agreed) will be withheld.  Again, I will never give or sell your email address to any third-party without your express permission.   


I reserve the right to amend this Policy at any time.  I agree to review this Policy at least annually for accuracy.  If you have additional questions regarding this Policy, I may be contacted at thecouponproject at hotmail dot com.
