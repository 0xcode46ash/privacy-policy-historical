ESA Privacy Policy

The ESA respects the privacy of our Web site visitors and is committed to providing a secure environment for them. This Privacy Policy details how the ESA safeguards the privacy of its Web site visitors. Please note that when you link to other sites from the ESA Web site, the ESA Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot control the activities on, those other sites.

The ESA does not collect personal identifying information (PII) from Web site visitors. PII means any information that enables online or offline contact, such as name, e-mail address, phone number, home address, social security number, driver's license number, date of birth, etc. However, if you choose to send email to the ESA that contains PII, the ESA will keep the email and any PII that it may contain in order to respond to your request. The ESA does passively collect some demographic information through the use of standard Unix Logs maintained on our web server. This includes the domain name and country of the visitor, the common directory used, and the browser with which the visitor is affiliated. 

Our Web Service Provider, which is Heller Information Services, collects the demographic information from our Web site visitors and distributes the information to the ESA for internal use. The ESA uses the collected demographic information, which is included in a Monthly and an Annual Report, only to understand where visitors are from. The ESA does not, nor could it, use the collected demographic information for marketing purposes. The PII collected from email is kept for one month strictly to respond to the request of the web site visitor, and is then deleted.

All demographic information is collected anonymously and all email addressed to the ESA that includes PII is kept confidential, and will not be distributed or otherwise disclosed to any third party. The information collected is kept secure. The ESA computer system is password protected and not modem accessible. The network connection is not connected directly to the Internet and email is stored on the Web Master's computer, which is password protected. 

Because the ESA does not collect PII, it is generally impossible for the ESA to offer our Web site visitors any choice as to collection and use of PII. However, where an email correspondent has sent the ESA an email containing PII, the correspondent can ask that the email be deleted. The ESA does not offer Web site visitors any choice as to the collection and use of their demographic information because the demographic information is collected anonymously, and thus cannot be connected to any particular visitor.

Since the ESA does not collect PII on its Web site, it is impossible for the ESA to offer Web site visitors access to any PII. However, an email correspondent can contact the Privacy Compliance Officer at the ESA and inquire about PII revealed in a sent email. Because demographic information is collected anonymously, the ESA cannot offer Web site visitors access to demographic information that may have been collected from them.

Because the ESA does not collect PII on its web site, the ESA does not employ any process to ensure the quality of PII. Moreover, because the ESA does not use PII included in an email sent to the ESA for reasons other than responding to the email correspondent, the ESA does not check the correctness of that information. Because the demographic information collected from ESA Web site visitors is anonymous, the ESA cannot ensure its accuracy or continued reliability.   


Because the ESA does not collect any PII on its Web site, a Web site visitor may freely refuse to offer PII without consequences. However, sending an email with incorrect PII may result in the ESA not being able to respond to the email correspondent. Due to the anonymous and limited nature of, and automated means through which demographic information is collected on the ESA Web site, visitors to the ESA Web site cannot refuse to have this demographic information collected.

We do not use cookies on this site.

Note to Parents:   
Because the ESA does not collect PII, we are in compliance with both Federal law and the ESA Principles and Guidelines for Fair Information Practices, which go above and beyond the requirements of Federal Law.
