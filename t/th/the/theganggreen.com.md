# TheGangGreen.Com - Privacy Statement

TheGangGreen.Com's policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our users.

TheGangGreen.Com does not collect any personal information about individuals except when such individuals provide such information on a voluntary basis. If such information has been received, TheGangGreen.Com guarantees that this information will not be sold or transferred to any third parties without the approval of the user.

However, TheGangGreen.Com may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone whose actions interfere with the Terms of Use, which can be found on this site as well.

TheGangGreen.Com reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site, which will help us provide better services for our users.

Additionally, users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on the message board of TheGangGreen.Com, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in the user's communication, can be collected and correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of TheGangGreen.Com.
