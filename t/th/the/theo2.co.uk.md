Product and/or service purchases: In order to complete the purchase of a product and/or service, an online credit card transaction is required. During this process we generate and collect certain verifiable personal information.

Correspondence: If a customer sends us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.

**How is information collected**

We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Site, including but not limited to those described below:  
Registration: You may be asked first to complete a registration form and provide personal information; you may also be asked to choose a user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain features the Site may choose to offer, including, but not limited to, Newsletters, Contests, Forums, Fantasy or other subscription based services.

Newsletters and Site emails: We may offer free newsletters to share information with you about the Site, about us and our affiliates and subsidiaries, or about our business partners and advertisers and sponsors. You may receive a newsletter either by registering for a particular newsletter or in conjunction with a special feature or membership for which you have registered on the Site. You may cancel your free email subscription by following the instructions provided on the Site or, in some instances, in the designated area of certain newsletters or emails. 

Contests or sweepstakes: We may operate contests and sweepstakes through the Site, which may require registration. Your personal information may be used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other related purposes. We may ask your permission to allow us to post publicly some of your information on the Site, such as on a winners page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes. Except as required by applicable law, we will not post your information without your permission. In some instances, a third party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes on the Site, and collect your information. In those cases, where we are not the operator or host of the contest or sweepstakes, we have no control over the information collected and accordingly urge you to review the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy policy applicable to the contest or sweepstakes before participating.

Surveys or voting: From time-to-time we may request personal information from you via surveys or voting polls. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information. At times, you may have to register to vote or to take part in a survey.

Cookies: As with many other website operators, we may use standard technology called "cookies," which are small data files that are stored on your computer's hard drive when you allow your browser to accept cookies and record how you navigate our website on each visit. Cookies automatically identify your Web browser to the Site whenever you visit the Site, and make using the Site easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences. By tracking how and when you use the Site, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Site are based on data obtained from cookies. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you generally can opt out of providing this information by turning the cookies off in your browser. However, some areas of the Site may be limited and may affect your visitor experience if you have disabled the use of cookies.

IP addresses and click-stream data: We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data for purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. Our computers identify your computer by its IP address. When you request web pages from the Site, our computer logs your IP address. Click-stream data is information collected by our computers when you request web pages from the Site. Click-stream data may include such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal information. When examined, this data helps us analyse how visitors arrive at the Site, for example what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like.

Transaction information: If you order any information from our Site, buy any of our products or subscribe for any of the services offered on our Site, we will ask you to complete an order form that will request certain information from you, including financial information such as a credit card number and expiration date and general contact, billing and shipping information.

Such information is collected and stored through encrypted means for your protection.

**How we use the information we collect**

All personal information that we obtain about you will be recorded, used and protected by us in accordance with current data protection legislation and this privacy policy.

We believe these uses allow us to improve our Site and provide better service to our customers.

We may use information in the file we maintain about a customer to resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems.

In addition, we may share information we collect about you with third party companies regarding promotions, sweepstakes and other opportunities / offers.
