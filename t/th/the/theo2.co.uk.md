### Your data

"Your data" means any data about You from which You can be identified such as Your name, address, telephone number, email address, financial details or other data which You may disclose to Us via the Site at any time. 

### When do We collect Your data?

We may collect Your data from several different areas of the Site, depending on the services which You choose to sign up to. However, upon entering the Site, Your information will automatically be collected by the following means:

### General Data Collection

#### IP addresses and click-stream data

An IP address is a number which is automatically assigned to Your computer whenever You access the Internet. When You access Our Site, We log Your IP address and can identify You from it. Click-stream data is information collected by Us when You navigate the Site, for example the specific web pages You looked at, the order You looked at them and the time of Your visit. This data helps Us analyse how visitors arrive at the Site and what content is most popular and We may use it for administration purposes or to report aggregate information to Our advertisers and sponsors.

#### Cookies

Cookies are small text files saved to Your computer and used to track Your navigation around the Site. Like many other website operators, We use "cookies" to record how You navigate the Site on each visit. Cookies help Us determine the most popular areas of our Site. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but You do not have to. If You do not want data collected through the use of cookies, or if You want to be notified when You receive a cookie, You can readjust Your browser settings (usually via the "Help" section of the tool bar). However, please note that by disabling cookies Your experience of the Site may be affected as access to some parts of it may be limited. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties on third party websites.

### Optional and Future Services

There are several optional services which You may choose to sign up to. The information required will vary for each service which is offered, therefore please see below:

#### Registration

You may be asked to fill out a registration form with Your data and/or to choose a user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain features the Site may have to offer. 

#### Newsletters, emails and alerts

We may offer free newsletters or alerts to share information with You about the Site, about Us, about Our affiliates and subsidiaries or about Our business partners, advertisers or sponsors. You may receive a newsletter or other alerts either by choosing to register for one or in conjunction with a special feature or membership for which You have registered. You can cancel Your subscription to newsletters, Site emails and alerts by contacting Us via the email address which You will normally find at the bottom of the newsletter or email in question. 

#### Competitions

We sometimes operate competitions through the Site which may require registration. The data You provide Us with may be used to notify You that You have won, to confirm delivery of a prize or for other related purposes. On occasion, We may publicly post some of Your data on the Site, (for example on a winners page). However, We will not post Your data on the Site without Your express consent. 

In some instances, a third party may operate or host a competition on the Site, and collect Your data. In those cases, where We are not the operator or host of the contest or sweepstake, We have no control over the data collected and accordingly urge You to review the third party's privacy policy before participating.

#### Surveys or voting

From time-to-time We may request data from You via surveys or voting polls made available on or through the Site. Participation is voluntary but may involve disclosure of Your data. Each survey or voting poll will explain if and how such data is used.

#### Transaction information

We may offer products for sale, or offer subscriptions for services. If You order any information from our Site, buy any of our products or subscribe for any other services offered on our Site, We will ask You to complete an order form that will request certain information from You, including financial information such as a credit card number and expiration date and general contact, billing and shipping information. We will use this information to complete the transaction that You have requested, i.e., to deliver the information, products or other services that You order, and to invoice You. Such information is collected and stored through encrypted means for Your protection.

#### Fantasy Games

We may offer fantasy games in connection with the Site. If You register to play such fantasy games, You may be asked to provide personal information. Each game will explain if and how such data is used. 

#### Message Boards

We may make message boards available to Our users. You are not required to provide any personal information when using these areas but You may choose to do so. If You post personal information online, it will be publicly available and You may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. AEG cannot ensure the security of any information You choose to make public on a message board. In addition, We cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect Your privacy. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in this area.

### How We use Your data

All data that We obtain about You will be used in accordance with current data protection legislation and this Privacy Policy. We will use Your data to process Your registrations, Your subscriptions to newsletters and site emails, Your competition entries, Your survey or voting information, Your transactions or Your involvement in fantasy games or message boards. We will also use it to analyse Site usage and for marketing or promotional purposes. We believe this allows Us to develop and improve the Site and to provide a better service to You.

With Your express consent We may also use Your data to send You information about related products or services that may be of interest to You.

We may occasionally use Your email address and, in rare situations, postal address or phone number, to contact You regarding administrative matters or notices.

We may also use Your data to deal with any enquiries made by You, to resolve disputes and to troubleshoot problems.

### Disclosure of Your data to third parties and overseas transfers of Your data

With Your express consent We, and if applicable, Our partners or other trusted third parties may use Your data for marketing, market research, promotions and related purposes.

With Your express consent, We may also send You offers from AEG, its affiliates and Our promotional partners based on the data You have given Us. 

We may also pass Your data to other parties as follows:

  * to Our employees and agents to administer Your account and the products and services provided to You by Us now or in the future; or
  * to the police, regulatory bodies, legal advisers or parties whose request We reasonably consider to be justified in connection with any alleged criminal offence, any suspected breach of the AEG Terms of Use or any other abuse of Our services by You.



Some of the organisations to which We may, with Your express consent, disclose Your data are situated outside the European Economic Area. In order to provide You with the products and services You require, We may need to transfer Your data to these countries, some of which do not have laws that protect Your privacy rights as extensively as those in the United Kingdom. However, if We do transfer Your data to other territories, We will take proper steps to ensure that Your data is properly protected and processed only in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By consenting to this Privacy Policy You are consenting to this transfer.

In the unlikely event that We sell or otherwise dispose of some or all of our business to another party, We reserve the right to transfer Your data as part of any assets sold or disposed of.

If You have previously given Your consent to our passing Your data to third parties or overseas and would like us to stop doing so, please post Your written request to "Compliance Officer, The Studio, The O2, London SE10 0DX." Your request must include Your name, email address and postal address. Written requests sent by post must also be signed. Please allow seven working days for Us to process Your request.

### How do We protect Your data?

We use industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of Your data. All the data collected by Us is stored on a secure server. However, please keep in mind that the internet and the World Wide Web are not secure mediums.

### Links to other websites

The Site contains links to other websites, for example links from advertisers, sponsors and partners. AEG is only responsible for the privacy practices and security of this Site. AEG is not responsible for the privacy policies, content or security of any linked websites. We recommend that You check the privacy and security policies of each and every website that You visit through our Site. Please also see our [Terms & Conditions](http://www.theo2.co.uk/footer/terms-conditions.html) for further information on third party sites. 

### Notification of changes to the Privacy Policy

Any such changes will be posted on this page, so that We can keep You informed of our information collection practices.

Your continued use of this Site shall constitute Your acceptance of any revised privacy policy.

### Unsubscribing and amending Your data

You are entitled by law to find out what data of Yours is held by AEG. You have the right to receive a copy of the data We hold about You for which We may charge a small administration fee.

You can also amend or remove information You give Us via the Site at any time. You can do this by writing to Us at AEG, The Studio, The O2, London SE10 0DX.
