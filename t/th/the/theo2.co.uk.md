#### When do We collect Your data?

We collect Your data which You submit to Us when signing up for services provided on the Site. We may combine this with data which You have submitted to other companies within the AEG Group, or with demographic and other information from other sources.

### General Data Collection 

**IP addresses and click-stream data**

An IP address is a number which is automatically assigned to Your computer whenever You access the Internet. When You access Our Site, We log Your IP address and can identify You from it. Click-stream data is information collected by Us when You navigate the Site, for example the specific Web pages You looked at, the order You looked at them and the time of Your visit. This data helps Us analyse how visitors arrive at the Site and what content is most popular and We may use it for administration purposes or to report aggregate information to Our advertisers, sponsors and event promoters. We collect this information using cookies. You can read more about how cookies work in Our [cookies policy](http://www.theo2.co.uk/footer/cookies.html). Our Site pages also contain electronic images known as web beacons which are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyse how Our Site is used. Web beacons may also be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients.

### Optional and Future Services 

There are several optional services which You may choose to sign up to. The information required will vary for each service which is offered. This section explains the information We collect for each service, and how We may use it. These uses are in addition to the uses described in sections 7 and 8 of this privacy policy.

#### Registration

You may be asked to fill out a registration form with Your data and/or to choose a user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain features the Site may have to offer. If you register with the site, your information and information related to purchases you make on any of our Sites will be aggregated and maintained as part of your profile and may be accessed or used by us.

#### Newsletters, emails and alerts

You may sign up to receive a newsletter or other alerts either by choosing to register for one or in conjunction with a special feature or membership for which You have registered. When You sign up, We will ask You if You would like to receive information about other companies in Our group or about Our business partners, advertisers or sponsors. If You agree, We may share Your information with them. You can cancel Your subscription to newsletters, Site emails and alerts by contacting Us via the email address which You will normally find at the bottom of the newsletter or email in question.

Remember, if you consent to receive texts from us, your mobile network may impose a charge on incoming texts. Please check with your mobile network provider for details. 

#### Competitions

We sometimes operate competitions through the Site which may require registration. The data You provide Us with may be used to notify You that You have won, to confirm delivery of a prize or for other related purposes. On occasion, We may publicly post some of Your data on the Site, (for example acceptance of a prize may also require you (unless prohibited by law) to allow us to post publically some of your information on the Site, such as on a winners page). However, We will not post Your data on the Site without Your express consent.

In some instances, a third party may operate or host a competition on the Site, and collect Your data. In those cases, where We are not the operator or host of the contest or sweepstake, We have no control over the data collected and accordingly urge You to review the third party's privacy policy before participating.

#### Surveys or voting

From time-to-time We may request data from You via surveys or voting polls made available on or through the Site. Participation is voluntary but may involve disclosure of Your data. Each survey or voting poll will explain how such data is used.

#### Transaction information

We may offer products for sale, or offer subscriptions for services. If You order any information from Our Site, buy any of Our products or subscribe for any other services offered on Our Site, We will ask You to complete an order form that will request certain information from You, including financial information such as a credit card number and expiration date and general contact, billing and shipping information. We will use this information to complete the transaction that You have requested, i.e., to deliver the information, products or other services that You order, and to invoice You. Such information is collected and stored through encrypted means for Your protection. We only share financial information with service providers where necessary for fulfilment of your order.

#### Fantasy Games

We may offer fantasy games in connection with the Site. If You register to play such fantasy games, You may be asked to provide personal information. Each game will explain how such data is used.

####  Chat Rooms, Forums and Message Boards 

We may make message boards available to Our users. You are not required to provide any personal information when using these areas but You may choose to do so. If You post personal information online, it will be publicly available and You may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. AEG cannot ensure the security of any information You choose to make public on a message board. In addition, We cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect Your privacy. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in this area.

#### Social Networks

We may ask you to share information about you stored on social networks and other third-party services in order to personalise your experience on the Site. You may choose not to provide this information.

Our Site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

You can log in to our Site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect, which will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address.

### How We use Your data

All data that We obtain about You will be used in accordance with current data protection legislation and this Privacy Policy. We will use Your data to process Your registrations, Your subscriptions to newsletters and site emails, Your competition entries, Your survey or voting information, Your transactions or Your involvement in fantasy games or message boards. We will also use it to analyse Site usage and for marketing or promotional purposes. We believe this allows Us to develop and improve the Site and to provide a better service to You, for example by displaying advertising based on Your interests, or identifying offers and promotions which are more likely to be relevant to you. 

With Your express consent We may also use Your data to send You information about related products or services that may be of interest to You.

We may occasionally use Your email address and, in rare situations, postal address or phone number, to contact You regarding administrative matters or notices.

We may also use Your data to deal with any enquiries made by You, to resolve disputes and to troubleshoot problems.

### Disclosure of Your data to third parties and overseas transfers of Your data

We will share Your data with certain parties, depending upon the purpose for which the information was provided, the consents which you give at the time the information is provided and the context in which the information was provided, as described in the following sections.

We may share Your information with other companies in the AEG Group who are also subject to this privacy policy and to event sponsors or promoters. With Your express consent:

  * to Our employees and agents to administer Your account and the products and services provided to You by Us now or in the future; or
  * to the police, regulatory bodies, legal advisers or parties whose request We reasonably consider to be justified in connection with any alleged criminal offence, any suspected breach of the AEG Terms of Use or any other abuse of Our services by You.



Some of the organisations to which We may disclose Your data are situated outside the European Economic Area. Some of these countries do not have laws that protect Your privacy rights as extensively as those in the United Kingdom. However, if We do transfer Your data to other territories, We will take proper steps to ensure that Your data is properly protected and processed only in accordance with this Privacy Policy. **By consenting to this Privacy Policy You are consenting to this transfer.**

In the unlikely event that We sell or otherwise dispose of some or all of Our business to another party, We reserve the right to transfer Your data as part of any assets sold or disposed of.

If You have previously given Your consent to Our passing Your data to third parties or overseas and would like us to stop doing so, please post Your written request to "Compliance Officer, The Studio, The O2, London SE10 0DX." Your request must include Your name, email address and postal address. Written requests sent by post must also be signed. Please allow seven working days for Us to process Your request.

### How do We protect Your data?

We use industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of Your data. All the data collected by Us is stored on a secure server. However, please keep in mind that the internet and the World Wide Web are not secure mediums.
