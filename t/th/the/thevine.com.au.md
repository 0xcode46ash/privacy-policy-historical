**What information we collect**

In general, the personal information we collect includes (but is not limited to) name, contact details and possibly financial information, including credit card information 

We also collect information about you that is not personal information. For example, we may collect anonymous data relating to your activity on our website (including IP addresses), or we may collect information from you on an anonymous basis in response to a survey. We generally use this information to report statistics, analyse trends, administer our services, diagnose problems and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use and to help improve the quality of our services. You acknowledge that, to the extent this information does not constitute personal information, we may use this information by any means whatsoever. 

We generally advise that you do not publish or communicate personal information, or at least limit the personal information that you publish or communicate, to the public via our website. You acknowledge that we cannot control the use of any personal information that is published or communicated to the public via our website (Non-Confidential Information) and such Non-Confidential Information can be collected and used by others. You agree that we may use and disclose Non-Confidential Information for any purpose. 

**How we collect it**

We may collect your personal information from a variety of sources, including from you, advertisers, mailing lists, recruitment agencies, contractors and business partners. 

We may collect your personal information when you request or acquire a product or service from us, register with us as a member, provide a product or service to us, complete a survey or questionnaire, enter a competition, participate in our services (including our blogs and forums) or when you communicate with us by e-mail, telephone or in writing (for example if you contact customer service to make a complaint or provide feedback). 

If, at any time, you provide personal or other information about someone other than yourself, you warrant that you have that person’s consent to provide such information for the purpose specified. 

We (or independent research companies that we use to measure and analyse usage across our website) may use tracking technologies (such as cookies, tags, or tracking code) to collect and store information about you and/or your website usage. These technologies may allow us to save encrypted passwords and preferences for you. We may use the information collected via these technologies to provide you with information or advertising that we believe may be of interest and/or relevance to you. Information collected may also be used to build anonymous statistical and demographical information which we may provide to third parties, generally for marketing, promotional purposes. 

Some of our advertisers or business partners whose content is incorporated into or linked from our website may also use tracking technologies. We do not control such third party tracking technologies, and you should refer to the privacy policy of the relevant third party for further information relating to their use of such tracking technologies.
