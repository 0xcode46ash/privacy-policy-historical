# Profits Run Privacy Policy

**  
PRIVACY POLICY**  
   
  
Your privacy is very important to Profits Run, Inc. (referred to herein as “ **our company** ”, “ **we** ” or “ **us** ”). We want to make your experience on our website as enjoyable and profitable as possible and want you to use, with complete confidence, the Services and Products (as defined below) that we offer.

We have created this privacy policy (“ **Privacy Policy** ”) to demonstrate our commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how our company collects, uses and maintains information from the people (a) who use our Internet services (“ **Services** ”), (b) who visit our website and may access some of our Services without having an account with us (“ **Visitors** ”) and (c) who purchase products (“ **Products** ”) and pay a fee to subscribe to our Services (“ **Members** ”). This Privacy Policy sets out the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the collection, use and maintenance of this information. We ask that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.  
  
   
**Information Our Company Collects and How It Is Used**  
   
  
_Introduction_ : Our company collects information in different ways from Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our websites or use our Products or Services. We use this information mainly to provide a personalized experience as you use our Products and Services. Our company generally does not share this information with third parties, except as provided for herein.  
  
   
  
_Upon Registration_ : Members may be asked to provide certain personal information when signing up for our Products and Services including name, address, telephone number, billing information, (such as credit card number) and the type of personal computer being used to access Services. Personal information collected from Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member’s account (e.g., for billing purposes.) This personal information is not shared with third parties, except as provided for herein. We may also generate general non-identifying profile information from the personal information that Members provide during registration (e.g., total number of Members, but not Member names), and such information may be used to sell advertisements.   
  
   
  
_With Partners_ : Some Products and Services may be offered to Visitors and Members in conjunction with an affiliate, independent contract seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide Visitors and Members with some of these Products and Services, the partner may need to collect and maintain personal information. In such cases, your personal information may be shared as provided for herein.  
  
   
  
_Shopping_ : If you order Products or Services from our company, we will use the personal information you provide only to process the order. We do not share this information with outside parties, except to the extent necessary to complete the order.  
  
   
  
_Advertisements_ : Our company may display online advertisements. In those cases we share general non-identifying profile information about our Visitors and Members collected during the registration process, through online surveys and promotions with these advertisers. In some cases, we use this general non-identifying profile information to deliver specific advertisements and for joint ventures. For example, an advertiser or joint venture company specifies the audience that they desire to reach and they provide our company with an advertisement tailored to that particular audience. Based upon the general non-identifying profile information we have collected, we may then display or send the advertisement to the intended people. Our company does not share personal information of Visitors or Members with these advertisers or joint venture partners.  
  
   
  
_Responses to Email Inquiries_ : When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to our company, the inquiry is answered using the return email address. Our company does not use the return email address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with anyone else, except as provided for herein.  
  
   
  
_Voluntary Customer Surveys_

: We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide our company with important information which helps improve the types of Products and Services offered and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation in customer surveys is voluntary.

We may combine the information that our company receives from people responding to our surveys and responses of other customers to prepare broader, general responses to the survey questions (e.g., age, gender, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry and other demographic information). Our company may then use this information to improve the quality of the Products and Services provided to you and to develop new Products and Services. This general non-identifying profile information may be shared with third parties.  
  
   
  
_Sharing Information_

: It is our company’s policy not to use or share the personal information we collect about Visitors or Members in ways unrelated to the methods described in this Privacy Policy without also providing you the opportunity to opt out and prohibit such unrelated disclosures. The following are permissible uses of sharing of personal information about Visitors or Members by our company, unless you elect to opt-out:

From time to time, we will share your postal address with other companies that offer products, services, or information that you might enjoy for purposes of sending you a special offer via direct mail.

When our company and a partner jointly promote our Products or Services, we may provide the partner some personal information such as the name, address and user name of the persons who subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion solely for the purpose of allowing us and the partner to assess the results of the promotion. In this case, personal information may not be used by the partner for any other purpose. 

Also, we may disclose information about Visitors, Members or information concerning your use of the Services or Products or websites accessible through the use of our Services or Products for any reason to credit agencies, collection agencies and law enforcement, if we (in our sole discretion) determine that it is reasonable to do so (as permitted by applicable law, if any) or as required by law.
