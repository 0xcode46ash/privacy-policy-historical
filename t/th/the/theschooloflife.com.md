# Privacy

As a company processing your personal data, we are regulated by the Data Protection Act. This page is intended to keep you informed about what we do with the personal data we process. ‘Personal data’, for the purposes of the Act, means any information from which you can be identified; it includes things like your name, e-mail address, delivery address, billing address, telephone number and IP address. 

First of all, we’d like to assure you that we are committed to protecting the privacy of all our users. We will endeavour to ensure that the information you provide us with is kept private and confidential, and we will only use it to provide the services you request.

## Uses and disclosure of personal information

We are registered as required under the Data Protection legislation, and we will only process your personal information carefully and lawfully, and in line with the principles set out in the Act.

We will only share your details within our organisation and among our employees and appointed representatives, or where necessary, with third parties such as the host partner or venue (for an event), or our suppliers and/or delivery partners (for the purchase of goods), for the purpose of providing our goods and/or services to you. We will not share your details with any other third parties unless we have your explicit consent. We will process your data for card payment, billing, operational, identity checking, and archival purposes. 

We will not transfer your data outside the European Union unless you require and have authorised us to do so. However, please note that purchasing a ticket for an event outside the European Union, or purchasing goods to be sent to an address outside of the European Union, may require us to transfer your data to third parties outside the European Union, for example to the event venue, for the purpose of fulfilling our obligations under the contract, and you consent to this where purchasing goods or services in the above circumstances.

We will hold your personal information for as long as we need to in order to comply with our legal obligations. You must inform us of any changes to it so that we can keep your personal information up to date.

However, if we reasonably believe that we are required by law to disclose your personal information to a third party, whether in compliance with any applicable law or regulation or by court order or in connection with legal proceedings, we may do so. We may also use aggregate anonymised data and share it with third parties.
