# The AA: Privacy policy

Centrica plc and its subsidiary companies, (the Centrica Group), consider protection of your privacy to be of utmost importance and are committed to providing you with a personalised service that meets your requirements in a way that safeguards your privacy. This policy explains how we may collect information about you and then use it in order to satisfy your particular requirements. It also outlines some of the security measures that we take in order to protect your privacy and gives certain assurances on things that we will not do. 

When we first obtain personal information from you, or when you take a new service from us, we will give you the opportunity to indicate if you do or do not (as applicable) wish to receive information from us about other services or products. Normally this will be done by way of a tick box on an application form or contract. You may revise the choice that you have made at any time by writing to us informing us of the change. 

Some of the personal information we hold about you may be sensitive personal data within the meaning of the Data Protection Act 1998 – for example, information about your health or ethnic origin. We will not use sensitive personal data about you other than for the specific purpose for which you provide it. 

### Collection of Information

1\. We may collect personal information about you from a number of sources, including: 

  * from you when you agree to take a service from us in which case this may include your contact details, date of birth, payment method and possibly bank details;
  * from you when you contact us with an enquiry or in response to a communication from us, in which case this may tell us something about your preferences; 
  * from publicly available sources, such as the electoral register. 



### Use of Information

2\. We may use personal information about you for a number of purposes, including: 

  * to help to identify you when you telephone us to make an enquiry – for example, by asking you for your date of birth or telephone number so that we can avoid disclosing information to a person who is not authorised by you to receive it 
  * carrying out marketing analysis and profiling and create statistical and testing information
  * to contact you by any means (including mail, email, telephone or text messages) about other services or products offered by us or by our carefully selected partners. We will only contact you in this way if you have previously indicated your consent
  * to help administer and contact you about improved administration of any accounts, services and products provided by us previously, now or in the future
  * to help prevent or detect fraud or loss 
  * to respond to enquiries from you 



3\. Whether or not you have opted out in relation to use of your information for direct marketing, it is our practice to search the mailing, telephone, fax and email preference services (as applicable) so that if you have registered your details with those services you will not receive any direct marketing material from us via that channel. 

4\. In some circumstances, we may do certain credit checks with licensed credit reference agencies when you apply to take a service or product. If this is applicable, then it will be stated in our terms and conditions of business. 

### Disclosure of Information

5\. We may disclose information we hold about you to third parties for the purpose of providing services you have requested, as part of the process of sale of one or more of our businesses, or where legitimately requested for legal or regulatory purposes, as part of legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings. From time to time, these third parties may be located outside the EEA in countries which do not have the same standards of protection for personal data as the UK.

6\. We, and other third-party credit organisations, may also access information about you: 

  1. to help make decisions on credit or credit related and insurance proposals and claims for you and other members of your household; and
  2. to check your identity to prevent money laundering unless other satisfactory proof of identity is provided.



7\. We may also disclose your information to other Centrica Group companies (including those using the British Gas and Scottish Gas and One.Tel brands) for them to carry out any of these purposes.

8\. You should also note that communications with you (including phone conversations and emails) may be monitored and recorded by us for quality assurance, legal, regulatory and training purposes.

### Protection of Information

9\. We maintain strict security measures in order to protect personal information. This includes following certain procedures, for example to check your identity when you telephone us, encrypting data on our web sites and in order to ensure compliance with all applicable legal requirements. 

### The Internet

10\. If you communicate with us via the Internet then we may occasionally use email to contact you about our services and products. When you first provide personal information to our Web Site we will normally give you the opportunity to indicate whether you would prefer us not to contact you in this way. However, you can always send us an email at any time to change your preferences. 

Please be aware that communications over the Internet, such as emails/webmails, are not secure unless they have been encrypted. Your communications may route through a number of countries before being delivered – this is the nature of the World Wide Web/Internet. We cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control. 

11\. We may use 'cookies' to monitor web-site user traffic patterns and site usage. They help us to understand how our customers and potential customers use our web sites so that we can develop and improve the design, layout and functionality of the sites. A cookie is a piece of information that is stored on your computer's hard drive and which records your navigation of a web site so that, when you revisit that web site, it can present tailored options to you based upon the stored information about your last visit. You can normally alter the settings of your browser to prevent acceptance of cookies. 

If you do not want us to deploy cookies in your browser, you can set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when a web site tries to put a cookie on your computer. However, rejecting cookies may affect your ability to use some of the products and/or services at our Web site.
