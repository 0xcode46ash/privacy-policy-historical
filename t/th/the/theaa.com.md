###  How we use your information

We use the information we receive from you, together with information we have obtained from our dealings with you (including in relation to goods and/or services we provide to you and/or your use of those goods and/or services), to provide goods and/or services that you request, to communicate with you, and to personalise information sent to you. Examples of how we may personalise information include using your information in generating an insurance quote for you, working out which departure airports are near to you, or when we will be delivering certain products in your area.

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others.

We store all the information you provide us, including information provided via forms you complete on our website, and information which we may collect from your browsing. Our server, in common with nearly all web servers, logs each page that is downloaded from the site.

Any new information you provide us may be used to update an existing record we hold for you. If you provide a work email address we will not be responsible for third parties having access to any communications we send.

To help us prevent fraud and money laundering, your details may be submitted to fraud prevention agencies and other organisations where your records may be searched. We will also conduct a search with a credit reference bureau to assist us in providing a quote, and to check which payment options we can make available to you. A copy of this search will be left on your credit file but will not affect your credit score. Where we are providing a motor insurance quotation this search will be noted on your credit file and may be reflected in your credit score.

Third parties may deliver some of our products to you, or provide all or part of the service requested by you. In these instances, while the information you provide will be disclosed to them, it will only be used for the administration of the service provided (including for example verification of any quote given to you and claims processing), underwriting and pricing purposes as appropriate, testing, and to maintain management information for business analysis.

If you apply for the Saga Credit Card or the AA Credit Card, we, or the supplier of the card, will search your record at a credit reference agency. If you apply for other financial services and/or products, a check of your details with fraud prevention agencies may be necessary. The precise nature of these processes is explained fully when you apply.

We ask for your home, mobile phone number, and email address to enable us to contact you in relation to an enquiry you have made, to contact you about relevant products or services, to contact you if there is a problem with your order, or there is another genuine reason for doing so.

We make outbound phone calls for a number of reasons relating to our many products, including breakdown cover and insurance. We are fully committed to the regulations set out by Ofcom and follow strict processes to ensure we comply with them.

If you provide us with credit or debit card details in order to pay for a service or product, we will keep such details secure and ensure that the details are only used further with your consent and/or for the purposes of any appropriate refunds.

When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address, phone numbers and email address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.

Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you by post, phone, mobile phone, email and SMS about new or existing services, products and special offers we think you'll find of interest.

We may use sensitive personal data collected in respect of one product to market another appropriate product to you.

Generally by providing the requested data you consent to us using that data for administrative purposes and for informing you of other products and services by letter, SMS, phone and/or email. We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the website.

If you make a donation to either of the Saga or AA Charitable Trusts, your data will not be used for marketing purposes.

Each time you receive electronic marketing information or a message, you have the option to decline to receive further marketing information from us. This is known as an 'opt-out'.

If you wish to exercise the opt-out: for Saga products and services please write to the Saga Group Data Protection Officer at The Saga Building, Enbrook Park, Sandgate, Kent CT20 3SE; for AA products and services please write to AA Group Data Protection Officer, Fanum House, Basing View, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 4EA; or for Allied Healthcare (Allied and Nestor Group) products or services write to the Data Protection Officer, Allied Healthcare Group, Enbrook Park, Sandgate, Kent CT20 3SE.

If you have more than one address or email address please make sure to notify any changes to your preferences for each address or email address you have registered with us.

As required by the Data Protection Act 1998, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information you have given to us.

If we provide information to a third party (either a provider of a product or service, or an external data processing agency such as a mailing house) we will exercise the strictest control over the third party contractually, requiring it and any of its agents and/or suppliers to:

  * maintain the security and confidentiality of the information and restrict access to those of its own employees
  * use the data for the agreed purpose only and prevent it being used for any other purpose by any other party
  * refrain from communicating with you other than concerning the product in question
  * return the data to us at the conclusion of any contract term, and destroy or delete any copies made of all or any part of the information unless copies are needed to be kept to comply with regulations



In addition, we will restrict the information disclosed to the absolute minimum necessary, for example, to provide the product or service.

Our own security procedures mean that we may occasionally have to request proof of identity or check your presence on the electoral roll.

In the event of phone calls from you, we also reserve the right to ask security questions (which we in our sole discretion deem appropriate) in order to satisfy ourselves that you are who you say you are.

If you contact us electronically we may collect your electronic identifier, eg Internet protocol (IP) address or phone number supplied by your service provider. This is to identify any repeat website visits, fraudulent behaviour or mystery shoppers using our websites.

###  Your consent

Before you provide any data to us we will endeavour to make it clear why we need it. Sometimes we may need sensitive personal data (examples may be past medical history or motoring convictions). When this is required we will obtain your consent first. Otherwise, by providing us with information, either orally or in writing, or by using our website, you consent to the collection, use and processing of the information we obtain from or about you as a result of our dealings with you (including any data we obtain from third parties) by Acromas to provide and send you information about goods and/or services we believe may be of interest to you.

A customer may properly give their spouse's or partner's consent over the phone or via the website providing the customer confirms they have permission to do so. If the consent is written, the spouse must independently endorse such consent.

Please note that we provide products and services including holidays outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Therefore if you travel on such holidays the information you provide may occasionally be transferred outside the EEA. From time to time Saga and AA may use service providers and organisations outside the EEA for the purpose of processing services, system testing and maintenance.

It is worth noting, however, that some non-EEA countries do not afford the same level of data security as the UK. By submitting your details you consent to this transfer. We will always use every reasonable effort to ensure sufficient protections are in place to safeguard your personal information.

Subsequent to your purchase of a product or service, we may enter into an arrangement for that service to be provided by a new third party. If this happens, the terms and conditions of your contract with us will provide that you consent to the transfer and processing of personal and/or sensitive personal data to the new provider, subject to the requirement of the Data Protection Act 1998 and associated regulations.

If you are entitled to breakdown service under AA membership you consent to the AA keeping you up to date with the AA Rewards discount scheme or similar available from time to time. Under this, as part of the benefit of being a member, the AA will, through the AA members' magazine, email or otherwise, give you membership information and details of any discounts or offers it may negotiate from time to time on behalf of its members.

###  Cookies

From offers and promotions to sound and video, the aim of this site is to be interesting, helpful and informative. We're keen to find out what you like and dislike – your feedback plays a key role in helping us improve this site. We use many techniques to follow your use of the site and provide you with a customised experience. The main and best known technique is by using what are known as 'cookies'.

**What are cookies?** Cookies are small data files that a website will put on your device, which in turn sends information back to the website. They cannot affect your device, but they do collect information that can be used to enhance the site. For example, a cookie can remember the items that you have placed into your shopping basket, or it can ensure you get the offer you requested. These are known as 'session' cookies, which expire as soon as you leave the site.

Other cookies can tell us if you come back. These are 'persistent cookies', which expire after a period of time unless you delete them from your device. We use them to help customise the site – to do things such as display relevant information based on your visit.

Some cookies enable sites to work, while others help us learn about what people are browsing for.

###  How we use cookies

We use cookies to ensure you get the most from your visit. They improve your experience of the site because certain features work best with cookies. Feedback and information from the cookies can also help make the site better. By visiting this site, you agree to our use of cookies and other technologies.

Rest assured that the cookies we use do not store personal details, such as payment card numbers. Here are the main types of cookies and what they do:

**1.  ** **Strictly necessary**  
 **In brief** These cookies enable you to get the information or service you’ve asked for. They’re essential – without them, some services may not work.

**For example** We use these cookies to enable you to use shopping baskets, which remember your choices and enable you to buy.

**2.  ** **Performance cookies**  
 **In brief** These cookies collect information about the pages you visit, where you go most often and whether you see error messages. The information is only used to ensure a website works well.

**For example** We gather information to diagnose problems and issues. We then use it to make improvements and fix errors.

**3\. Functional cookies**  
 **In brief** These cookies remember choices you’ve made to personalise the site. They may remember where you are so you can get tailored information, or remember changes you have made to help you browse, such as increasing the text size.

**For example** If you ask for services based on your location, we sometimes store a cookie so that next time you visit you won’t have to tell us again.

**4\. Targeting or advertising cookies**  
 **In brief** These cookies collect anonymous information about your browsing habits which are then used to make advertising relevant to you. They remember if you have visited a website and share this information with advertisers.

**For example** We limit advertising to certain sections of the website. These services are provided by our carefully selected and monitored partners, and we are committed to ensuring any information is used appropriately.

###  Links to other sites

We often link off to other sites to help provide you with extra information or services. For example, to make it easy for you to share information with your family and friends, we provide links to Twitter, Facebook and other popular social media or book-marking sites.

###  Disclosure of information to third parties

As previously mentioned, we do not sell, trade or rent your information, and will never disclose information about you (including information obtained from our dealings with you) to third parties, except:

a) to fulfil your specific orders for a product or service or information in the event that third parties deliver the relevant product or service or information. For example, if you go on a holiday with us, the hotel needs to know who you are. If you take out an insurance policy provided by a third party, they will need your details in order to administer the policy, verify the quote given to you and process any claims;

b) where third parties administer part or all of the product or service;

c) for underwriting, pricing, insurance rating analysis and testing purposes, and to maintain management information for business analysis.

We may of course be obliged at law to pass on your information to the police or any other statutory or regulatory authority and in some cases, exemptions may apply under the Data Protection Act 1998, whereby we can legitimately release personal data eg to prevent or detect crime or in connection with legal proceedings.

See also **How we use your information** above for information on how we may exchange personal data with third parties to help us prevent fraud and money laundering, to assist us in providing a quote, or to check which payment options we can make available to you.

Back to top

###  Employees and employees' spouses or partners

Personal and/or sensitive personal data of an employee and his or her spouse or partner who take out a product and/or service may be shared to any group company for the purpose of operation of the product or service or for administrative reasons (including but not limited to claim administration, which may be assisted by the employee's department personnel). By accepting or purchasing the product or service the employee and his or her spouse or partner provide the necessary consent for this transfer of data.

Back to top

###  Data Protection Act marketing consent

Saga and AA groups of companies have adopted the following procedure in gaining your consent to be placed on their marketing lists.

When you first make an enquiry of or buy a product from Saga Group or AA Group you consent to receiving marketing about other products and services from us. Your details are placed on our marketing list for the group and a 'questionnaire' will be sent to you; it may be sent electronically. This questionnaire gives a list of all the products of the group, and the option of choosing which products you would or would not like to receive information about. You can also choose not to receive any marketing from us. Once you have chosen what you would like to receive we ask you to return the completed form back to us. The marketing selections will be administered where applicable.

Back to top

###  Amendment and retention of information

Please advise us in writing as to any changes in your circumstances. Obviously it is preferable for us to retain up to date information. We will amend details as required. We are, however, obliged and permitted by law and regulation to retain certain types of data for a minimum period of time. The minimum period of time tends to be for six years but can be longer if the statute or regulation requires.

Back to top

###  Subject access requests

You have a statutory right of access to accessible personal and/or sensitive personal data that we hold about you. In order to exercise this right, your application must be in writing for security reasons. Please write to the Data Protection Officer at The Saga Building, Enbrook Park, Sandgate, Kent CT20 3SE for requests relating to information held by Saga Group companies; or to the AA Group Data Protection Officer, Fanum House, Basing View, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 4EA for requests relating to information held by AA Group companies.

Please refer to the information you wish to see giving dates if possible, and enclose your cheque for £10 payable to Saga Group Limited or Automobile Association Developments Limited.

Requests relating to Allied Healthcare should be made to the branch manager of your local branch, details of which can be found at [www.alliedhealthcare.com](http://www.alliedhealthcare.com/). The £10 cheque should be made payable to 'Nestor Primecare Services Ltd t/a Allied Healthcare'.

We will not administer Subject Access Requests by a third party unless accompanied by a written authority of the individual who is the subject of the request.

Back to top

###  Your choice of information

You may change the type of material sent to you at any time. Saga and AA allow you to select which products you wish to receive information about, and to cancel any previous expressions of interest in particular areas. If you wish to take advantage of this, for Saga products please write to Information Processing at The Saga Building, Enbrook Park, Sandgate, Kent CT20 8SE; for AA products please write to the AA Group Data Protection Officer at Automobile Association Developments Limited, Fanum House, Basing View, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 4EA.
