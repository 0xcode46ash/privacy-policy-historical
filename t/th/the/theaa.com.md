###  How we use your information

We use the information we receive from you, together with information we have obtained from or in connection with our dealings with you (including in relation to goods and/or services we provide to you and/or your use of those goods and/or services), to provide goods and/or services that you request, to communicate with you, and to personalise information sent to you. Examples of how we may personalise information include using your information in generating an insurance quote for you or when we will be delivering certain products in your area.

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others for marketing purposes.

We store all the information you provide to us, including information provided via forms you complete on our website, and information which we may collect from your browsing. Our server, in common with nearly all web servers, logs each page that is downloaded from the site.

Any new information you provide to us may be used to update an existing record we hold for you. If you provide a work email address we will not be responsible for third parties having access to any communications we send.

To help us prevent fraud and money laundering, your details may be submitted to fraud prevention agencies and other organisations where your records may be searched. We will also conduct a search with a credit reference bureau to assist us in providing a quote, and to check which payment options we can make available to you. A copy of this search will be left on your credit file but will not affect your credit score. Where we are providing a motor insurance quotation this search will be noted on your credit file and may be reflected in your credit score.

If you apply for one of our insurance or financial services products (such as a credit card or loan), we, or the supplier of the product, will search your record at a credit reference agency and may check your details with fraud prevention agencies. The precise nature of these processes is explained fully when you apply.

Third parties may deliver some of our products to you, or provide all or part of the service requested by you. In these instances, while the information you provide will be disclosed to them, it will only be used for the administration of the service provided (including for example verification of any quote given to you and claims processing), underwriting and pricing purposes as appropriate, testing, and to maintain management information for business analysis.

We ask for your home, mobile phone number, and email address to enable us to contact you in relation to an enquiry you have made, to contact you about relevant products or services, to contact you if there is a problem with your order, or there is another reasonable reason for doing so.

We make outbound phone calls for a number of reasons relating to our many products, including breakdown cover and insurance. We are fully committed to the regulations set out by Ofcom and follow strict processes to ensure we comply with them.

If you provide us with credit or debit card details in order to pay for a service or product, we will keep such details secure and ensure that the details are only used further with your consent and/or for the purposes of any appropriate refunds.

If you use your AA card to obtain discounts from third party organisations, we may receive information from those organisations about your purchases. We may use this information for market research and analysis purposes and to send you marketing we think you'll find of interest (in accordance with your marketing preferences).

When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address, phone numbers and email address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.

We may also use the information we collect to notify you by post, phone, mobile phone, email and SMS about new or existing services, products and special offers we think you'll find of interest.

We may use sensitive personal data collected in respect of one product to market another appropriate product to you.

Generally by providing the requested data you consent to us using that data for administrative purposes and for informing you of other products and services by letter, SMS, phone and/or email. We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the website.

If you make a donation to the AA Charitable Trust, your data will not be used for marketing purposes.

Each time you receive electronic marketing information or a message, you have the option to decline to receive further marketing information from us. This is known as an 'opt-out'.

If you wish to exercise the opt-out for receiving marketing information about AA products and services, please write to AA Data Protection Officer, The AA, Fanum House, Basing View, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 4EA.

If you have more than one address or email address please make sure to notify any changes to your preferences for each address or email address you have registered with us.

We may use your information (and contact details) for market research and analysis purposes in order to evaluate, assess and improve the products and services we provide, and to identify trends and popular products and services. This may include contacting you to take part in customer satisfaction and feedback surveys.

As required by the Data Protection Act 1998, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information you have given to us.

If we provide information to a third party (either a provider of a product or service, or an external data processing agency such as a mailing house) we will exercise the strictest control over the third party contractually, typically requiring it and any of its agents and/or suppliers to:

  * maintain the security and confidentiality of the information and restrict access to those of its own employees
  * use the data for the agreed purpose only and prevent it being used for any other purpose by any other party
  * refrain from communicating with you other than concerning the product or service in question
  * return the data to us at the conclusion of any contract term, and destroy or delete any copies made of all or any part of the information unless copies are needed to be kept to comply with applicable law or regulations



In addition, we will restrict the information disclosed to the absolute minimum necessary, for example, to provide the product or service.

Our own security procedures mean that we may occasionally have to request proof of identity or check your presence on the electoral roll.

In the event of phone calls from you, we also reserve the right to ask security questions (which we in our sole discretion deem appropriate) in order to satisfy ourselves that you are who you say you are.

If you contact us electronically we may collect your electronic identifier, eg Internet protocol (IP) address or phone number supplied by your service provider. This is to identify any repeat website visits, fraudulent behaviour or mystery shoppers using our websites.

###  Your consent

Before you provide any data to us we will endeavour to make it clear why we need it. Sometimes we may need sensitive personal data (examples may be medical history or motoring convictions). When this is required we will obtain your consent first. Otherwise, by providing us with information, either orally or in writing, or by using our website, you consent to the collection, use and processing of the information we obtain from or about you as a result of our dealings with you (including any data we obtain from third parties) by the AA Group to provide and send you information about goods and/or services we believe may be of interest to you.

A customer may properly give their spouse's or partner's consent over the phone or via the website providing the customer confirms they have permission to do so. If the consent is written, the spouse must independently endorse such consent.

From time to time the AA Group may use service providers and organisations outside the European Economic Area (EEA) for the purpose of processing services, system testing and maintenance.

It is worth noting, however, that some non-EEA countries do not afford the same level of data security as the UK. By submitting your details you consent to this transfer. We will always use reasonable efforts to ensure sufficient protections are in place to safeguard your personal information as required by the Data Protection Act 1998.

Subsequent to your purchase of a product or service, we may enter into an arrangement for that product or service to be provided by a new third party. If this happens, the terms and conditions of your contract with us will provide that you consent to the transfer and processing of personal and/or sensitive personal data to the new provider, subject to the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998 and associated regulations.

If you are entitled to breakdown service under AA membership you consent to the AA Group keeping you up to date with the AA Rewards discount scheme or similar available from time to time. Under this, as part of the benefit of being a member, the AA Group will, through the AA members' magazine, email or otherwise, give you membership information and details of any discounts or offers it may negotiate from time to time on behalf of its members.

###  Disclosure of information to third parties

As previously mentioned, we do not sell, trade or rent your information for marketing purposes, and will never disclose information about you (including information obtained from our dealings with you) to third parties, except:

a) to fulfil your specific orders for a product or service or information in the event that third parties deliver the relevant product or service or information. For example, if you take out an insurance policy provided by a third party, they will need your details in order to administer the policy, verify the quote given to you and process any claims;

b) where third parties administer part or all of the product or service;

c) for underwriting, pricing, insurance rating analysis and testing purposes, and to maintain management information for business analysis;

d) where the third party provides services on our behalf; or

e) where we provide products or services to you pursuant to or in connection with your relationship with a third party, in which case we may share information about you with the third party.

Additionally, we may of course be obliged at law to pass on your information to the police or any other statutory or regulatory authority and in some cases, exemptions may apply under the Data Protection Act 1998, whereby we can legitimately release personal data eg to prevent or detect crime or in connection with legal proceedings.

See also **How we use your information** above for information on how we may exchange personal data with third parties to help us prevent fraud and money laundering, to assist us in providing a quote, or to check which payment options we can make available to you.

###  Employees and employees' spouses or partners

Personal and/or sensitive personal data of an employee and his or her spouse or partner who take out a product and/or service may be shared to any group company for the purpose of operation of the product or service or for administrative reasons (including but not limited to claim administration, which may be assisted by the employee's department personnel). By accepting or purchasing the product or service the employee and his or her spouse or partner provide the necessary consent for this transfer of data.

###  Data Protection Act marketing consent

The AA Group have adopted the following procedure in gaining your consent to be placed on their marketing lists.

When you first make an enquiry of or buy a product from the AA Group you consent to receiving marketing about other products and services from us. Your details are placed on our marketing list for the AA Group and a 'questionnaire' will be sent to you; it may be sent electronically. This questionnaire gives a list of all the products of the group, and the option of choosing which products you would or would not like to receive information about. You can also choose not to receive any marketing from us. Once you have chosen what you would like to receive we ask you to return the completed form back to us. The marketing selections will be administered where applicable.

###  Amendment and retention of information

Please advise us in writing as to any changes in your circumstances. Obviously it is preferable for us to retain up to date information. We will amend details as required. We are, however, obliged and permitted by law and regulation to retain certain types of data for a minimum period of time. The minimum period of time tends to be for six years but can be longer if the statute or regulation requires.

Back to top

###  Subject access requests

You have a statutory right of access to personal and/or sensitive personal data that we hold about you. In order to exercise this right, your application must be in writing for security reasons. Please write to the AA Data Protection Officer at The AA, Fanum House, Basing View, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 4EA.

Please refer to the information you wish to see giving dates if possible, and enclose a cheque for £10 payable to Automobile Association Developments Limited.

We will not administer Subject Access Requests by a third party unless accompanied by a written authority of the individual who is the subject of the request.

###  Your choice of information

You may change the type of material sent to you at any time. The AA Group allows you to select which products you wish to receive information about, and to cancel any previous expressions of interest in particular areas. If you wish to take advantage of this please write to the AA Data Protection Officer at The AA, Fanum House, Basing View, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 4EA.
