# The Real Tooth Fairies® - Guest Services - Privacy Policy

**Royal Council of the Real Fairyland’s Privacy Policy** –   
in effect November 1, 2012

**You and your Earthie child’s use of this web site signifies that you accept our Terms and Conditions.**

Here at the Royal Council of the Real Fairyland, LLC, we are dedicated to protecting your online privacy when visiting this web site. We are committed to child safety and providing your child with a wholesome, entertaining play experience online. We do not collect and keep any personally identifying Earthie information online from you unless you volunteer it, and you are 13 years or older. We do not collect and keep personal information online from Earthie children under the age of 13 years without permission of their parent and/or legal guardian, except in limited circumstances authorized by law and set forth in this Privacy Policy. Whenever we reference the term “parents” below, we intend to include legal guardians. Do note that this site and its servers are located in the U.S. By using this site you agree to the transfer, collection, processing and use of data by Royal Council of the Real Fairyland, LLC, its affiliates, subsidiaries and parent companies.

IF YOU ARE AN EARTHIE UNDER 18, PLEASE READ THIS POLICY WITH YOUR PARENTS AND ASK ABOUT PARTS THAT ARE NOT CLEAR TO YOU.. IF YOU ARE AN EARTHIE UNDER AGE 13, IT’S IMPORTANT THAT YOU GET YOUR PARENT’S PERMISSION BEFORE YOU TELL ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, TO ROYAL COUNCIL OF THE REAL FAIRYLAND, LCC—OR TO ANY OTHER PARTY ON THE INTERNET. ALSO, PURCHASING PRODUCTS AT OUR ONLINE STORES REQUIRES USE OF A VALID CREDIT CARD AND CONFIRMATION THAT THE USER IS OVER 18.

PARENTS, PLEASE NOTE: Royal Council of the Real Fairyland, LLC adheres to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) and the guidelines of the Children’s Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. in all of our web sites for children.

Parents, you can support your child’s healthy use of the internet by spending quality time online with your children and observing your Earthie children’s online website use. Our online interactive worlds for children offer much family enjoyment and sharing through the Every Kindness Counts, Dream Tree, Me Doll Dress-Up, Castle Room decorating with virtual purchases, entertaining children’s games and other tooth fairy-related activities. Please help us protect your Earthie child’s privacy by instructing your child to never provide personal information on this site or any other without your permission. By identifying yourself appropriately, parents may review their Earthie child’s personal information that we have collected, request deletion of their information and child account, or refuse to allow further collection or use for marketing purposes. Parents have the option to receive Sharemails from us, which list for you much of the content that your child writes and shares with her Real Tooth Fairy online. Those Sharemails keep parents informed as soon as your child writes about herself or himself online in the Ask For Magic Letters, Every Kindness Counts, Dream Tree, and certain other online play sections.  We offer a one-of-a-kind experience for parents to easily share in your child’s online activities by seeing it in their words. No other child can view your child’s written words through our site activities.

**1\. How does the Royal Council of the Real Fairyland, LLC notify Earthie parents and obtain consent for the collection of information from children?**

Your child’s Real Tooth Fairy sends parents an email called SHAREMAIL when your child Registers and/or takes the Royal Quiz to get matched up to the child’s Real Tooth Fairy. Parents have the option to activate the child’s free online registration and the child will only be granted access to login to the site’s registered user activities with that explicit parent permission given by activating the child account. For every child (anyone under 13 years of age) we require the parent or guardian to provide verifiable parental consent such as an email activation, mail-in letter, fax, or toll-free (in the US) call to our Guest Services phone number.

Royal Council of the Real Fairyland does not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable information in any website activities. There are no chat rooms or message boards. Children can view other children’s anonymous site login screen names for our company sites (not the child name), they can view their Me Dolls, their decorated castle rooms, and images of the site activity that user did most recently. However in viewing these site images, there is no personally identifying information shown about that child and there is no way in our site activities to exchange any personally identifying information among children under age 13.

A parent may refuse a child’s participation on this website by not activating the child registration as noted above, but in addition, the parent may cancel the child’s participation by going to the For Parents page and scrolling to the bottom above the Official Seal and click on the line that says: To cancel a child’s participation on this site or a parent member account, [click here](http://trf-content.s3.amazonaws.com/printable_pdfs/parents/parental_review.pdf). This link goes to a form to submit to our site via mail or fax refusing your child’s participation on the site. The Contact Us page shows parents a phone number to call to make such a request by phone.

A parent may change personal information by emailing [help@therealtoothfairies.com](mailto:help@therealtoothfairies.com), calling our Guest Services number on the Contact Us page, or clicking to My Royal Account and going to My Profile page. The My Royal Account area is where parents can view their purchase history, their Upgraded Membership History and their Magic Letter History. You may also reset your password or your child’s first name and password. Here you may opt out of promotional emails by clicking the Sharemail Preferences button to change your Sharemail preferences. Sharemails often share with the parent the specific things your child is writing about herself or himself on Lost Tooth Garden Pages and in Ask For Magic Letter Requests to their Real Tooth Fairies. Sharemails also show you the Kindness activities your child has chosen to do in your family whenever your child picks or records a new kindness she has completed as well as products parents may wish to purchase.

**2\. Will Royal Council of the Real Fairyland, LLC collect personal information about me if I’m 13 or older?**

At Royal Council of the Real Fairyland, LLC. we don’t require anyone to share any personal Earthie information about themselves in order to enjoy the magic of our websites. You may visit parts of our web sites without any need to register with us. However, our web sites may contain special sections and privileges, such as certain activities for members that register. Membership in special online activities open to Earthie children may require registration with activation by a parent or legal guardian. For joining any paid memberships for your child, a parent inputting their personal and credit card information is required and through that process, we require that only parents can register their children for a paid activity. This is the personal Earthie information that we typically ask of adult users: first and last name, birth date, mailing address, phone number and parent e-mail address. We do not collect any personal Earthie information from you online unless it is voluntarily provided, such as when registering for contests, sweepstakes, promotions, downloads, or free demos, completing our online customer surveys, filling in statements in certain activities, joining a club, or purchasing products. If an Earthie parent does their parent registration using Facebook for age verification, we only collect your parent name and parent email.

We also collect information from you offline if you contact us to request a Real Fairyland catalogue or participate in a Real Tooth Fairy promotion, like a sweepstakes or drawing. We may obtain customer lists, demographic and other information from other sources. We may combine this information with information we collect online to better understand your needs, improve our site, our products, and our services, and better serve your needs.

**3\. What ordering information does Royal Council of the Real Fairyland, LLC collect in the online shopping sites and/or for online purchases?**

We offer products to purchase in our online Real Tooth Fairy Stores as well as parent purchases of Magic Letters, Parents Only Zone membership, and VIP Upgraded Memberships. Earthie customers must be over age 18 and have to provide a valid credit card or other valid payment method accepted by Royal Council of the Real Fairyland, LLC to purchase products online. We offer a Wish List for Earthie visitors under age 18 to use while browsing the online store, but Earthie children cannot make purchases without their parents. When an Earthie customer places an order or requests a catalogue online, we collect information associated with the requested transaction, such as the customer’s name, mailing address, products ordered, shipping addresses, email address, and/or credit card information. We ask for this special Earthie information so that we may fulfill your order or Real Tooth Fairy catalogue request. We will send a confirming e-mail message to the e-mail address provided when an Earthie customer places an order online.

Parents or other adults have the option of registering certain information for future orders while completing their online order. For the customers who choose to register, we will save their Earthie adult login name, password, name and mailing address, alternate ship-to addresses. Credit card information is not saved by our online store; it is securely transmitted via a secured third party credit card processor such as Authorize.net. When applicable, we will record the name of your child’s Real Tooth Fairy. A customer account will be created for online when an adult customer has successfully entered all the required information. Customers can access their online account information through the “My Royal Account” feature at our site that will give you access to the Parents Only Zone and also your Royal Account. We may keep this information in our database for use at later time. When registered online customers return to the site to place subsequent orders, they can identify themselves with an adult login name and password. Be sure to use a password for adult login and registration that your child does not know. The Parents Only Zone is accessible only to parents by entering their personal email and password. Each time a parent requests to enter the Parents Only Zone, the parent will be asked to enter that email and password as a security measure to ensure that only Parents enter that zone.

If a customer includes a child’s birth date and the parent e-mail address, this information will be used to help us provide products and services that meet your Earthie needs, improve customer service, and to help you make your child’s friendship with her Real Tooth Fairy more positive and rewarding. We will keep parent information in a database if you request a catalogue, online or offline, or sign up to receive promotional e-mails, including as part of a sweepstakes or drawing entry.

**4\. Will Royal Council of the Real Fairyland collect any personal information about any Earthies under 13?**

Without ever registering or providing personally identifiable information, an Earthie child can visit certain areas of our sites directed to children. We offer Earthie child visitors the opportunity to voluntarily register a free request to use the site through an online form that asks only for the child first name, age/birthdate, and a fictional “member or screen name” and child-selected password, to protect the child’s privacy, along with a parent email address. The parent then receives an instant notification email showing the child’s chosen screen name and password, and the parent is asked for the parent’s express permission to activate the free child account in order for the child to be able to participate in the site. A child’s selected screen name is the only name shown on the publicly viewed areas of the site; not the child’s actual first name. When a child’s e-mailed submission is posted to any area of the web site, we only use the child’s first name, age, and state, and then only with prior written permission by the child’s parent using our online form. Likewise, any photographs or videos of children posted on our site are only done with prior written permission from the child’s parent using our online form.

We do not collect personal information online from children under 13 without their parent’s consent except in special, limited circumstances. Children whose parents have given permission for their child to participate in the site will have opportunities to voluntarily share their latest news with their Real Tooth Fairy, write a Custom Kindness ticket or record kindnesses they did in the Every Kindness Counts program, write about their newest lost tooth, and write about their dreams, talents, achievements, kindnesses, and habits in their Real Dream Trees or other child Pages. Anything written by the site cannot be viewed by others via site activities. Royal Council of the Real Fairyland might collect an e-mail address and first name (or screen name) from your child under 13 without your consent online, but only in the following special instances: A. If a child under 13 sends a request to our site “help” or “info” or other email email, we do not have any way to know their age, but we keep a submitted e-mail address long enough to respond to their request and delete this information from our system immediately after we respond. Parents please be aware that Royal Council of Real Fairyland, LLC cannot control what someone enters in a write-in field in our website activities. Be assured though that we do not allow anyone other than the child herself or the parent to view any areas of the site where a child can write freely in a typed field. 

B. We do not ask for more information from your Earthie child than is necessary for your child to participate in any activity such as Royal Council of the Real Fairyland’s magical site activities or promotions, like sweepstakes or special contests, which may be open to children even if they are under 13. 

In this situation, we ask the child for the parent’s email so that we may notify you of their activity online. If we need more information than First name/Screen name and birth date, we will contact you directly and ask that you provide that information for your Earthie Child. We might ask for your mailing address so that we can send to you, for your Earthie child, any prizes your child wins, or for your telephone number so that we can notify you when your child has won. Any information you or your child give us in these special circumstances will be removed from our database once the promotion, program or activity is finished, and after any legally required period for keeping such information is complete. Once you are properly identified, parents may review the personal information we have collected online from their child, request we remove any identifying information, or refuse to allow further collection. However, if you ask us to cancel your child’s account from our database, we will ask that you ask your child not to participate in our activities to avoid further information collection.

If we collect online contact information from a child under 13 years for the sole purpose of responding directly to a specific request from the child, such as for help with a website problem, we will not use this information to re-contact the child and will delete the information from our records.
