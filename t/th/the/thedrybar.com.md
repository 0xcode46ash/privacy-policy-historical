Drybar Holdings LLC (“Drybar”) is committed to ensuring the privacy of our customers’ personal information, and this privacy policy is designed to voluntarily comply with current privacy legislation. 

SECTION 1 - INFORMATION COLLECTED  
When you purchase something from our online store, as part of the buying and selling process we collect the personal information you give us such as your name, address, email address, telephone number, and credit or debit card number. When you browse our online store, we also automatically receive your computer’s internet protocol (IP) address in order to provide us with information that helps us learn about your browser and operating system.

Navigation: Even if you do not make a purchase on our site, we have the ability to track usage of our website, including what pages are visited, what products are viewed, and the third-party sites that led you to our site. This information is not used to track information about individuals, but is used at an aggregate level to customize our site, improve the online experience, and plan advertising and promotions.

Other information: There are times when you may provide information to us voluntarily. This occurs when you provide feedback to us through emails, return forms, letters, or telephone calls. We use this information to respond to your query, to keep track of customer feedback, and to improve our service to customers.

SECTION 2 - CONSENT  
When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we infer that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only. 

If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no. If after opting-in to our marketing list, you no longer wish to be contacted, you may withdraw your consent by clicking the “unsubscribe” option in the email message, informing us at privacyofficer [at] thedrybar.com (please write email address with the appropriate symbol), or mailing us at:

SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE  
Drybar does not sell or otherwise share your personal information with anyone else, such as advertising agencies or marketing companies. We only send marketing information to those customers who specifically sign up for our mailing list. Marketing information sent by Drybar may be sent by us as part of a cross-promotion or other collaboration with other companies or brands, but we do not disclose personal information to such companies or brands.

Drybar will share your personal information internally with those staff members who need it to complete your purchase or carry out your instructions regarding the receipt of marketing information. Authorized Drybar service providers may also have access to this information in order to carry out their responsibilities directly connected with the processing of your purchases or handling of customer service issues. Outside of these activities, we will not disclose your personal information to any third party without your written consent unless required to do so by law.

SECTION 4 - SHOPIFY  
Our online store is hosted by Shopify Inc. This company provides us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and services to you. Your data is stored through Shopify’s databases and software application. They store your data on a secure server behind a firewall.

Shopify stores your credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our online store and its service providers. Drybar does not currently retain credit card numbers internally.

SECTION 5 - SECURITY  
We use encryption technology in our online store in an attempt to protect you against the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information. When you fill out any forms during checkout, a secure server encrypts your information through the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. 

To be sure you’re browsing securely during a transaction, check your web browser’s status or address bar for the closed padlock icon. This icon indicates that you are viewing a secure web page. Also, all browsers display an “s” after the “http” (https://) in the website address to indicate that you are in a secure environment. 

Your credit card information is encrypted using SSL and stored with AES-256 encryption. Although no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally accepted industry standards.

SECTION 6 - COOKIES  
Drybar, as with many other websites, makes use of “cookies” to help deliver a better customer shopping experience. Cookies are alphanumerical identification elements that we transfer to the hard drive of your computer via your web browser. They enable our systems to recognize your browser and to offer you value-added services, such as saving the contents of your shopping basket and to deliver a more personalized shopping experience.

SECTION 7 - AGE OF CONSENT  
By using this site, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your state or province of residence, or that you are the age of majority in your state or province of residence and you have given us your consent to allow any minors under your care to use this site.

SECTION 8 - CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY  
We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time. Changes and clarifications will take effect immediately upon their posting on this website.

If our company is acquired or merged with another company, your information may be transferred to the new owners so that we may continue to sell products to you.
