# Our Privacy Policy - Scholastic UK - Children's Books, Book Clubs, Book Fairs and Teacher Resources

This Privacy Policy applies to our online practices only.

The following policy applies to the SCHOLASTIC.CO.UK site and its subsidiary sites.

### PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

We consider the following, among other things, to be personally identifiable information: initials and surname, e-mail address, postal address (including postcode) and phone number. We may request such information from our visitors to process and fulfill orders for products or services.

In order to provide you with the best possible service, Scholastic UK Ltd has made its policy to monitor member’s use of our web sites and collect certain personal information. When you enrol for one of our book clubs online, Scholastic UK Ltd will store your e-mail address along with any other information you may provide. When you use further facilities available on the web sites, we may need to collect further information about you. This information may include, but is not limited to, details such as your name, postal address, your credit card details and if applicable your school, school address and telephone number..

We may use this personally identifiable information to customise the content on SCHOLASTIC.CO.UK and its subsidiary sites, to such visitors’ current and future needs and to process any applications or transactions undertaken by you and for internal administration and analysis.

### NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION AND THE USE OF COOKIE TECHNOLOGY

We collect non-personally identifiable information through the use of a software technology called “cookies,” and through our visitors’ voluntary submissions to us and/or upon our request. By non-personally identifiable information, we are referring to information about our visitors’ browsers (e.g., Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer), operating systems (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), Internet service providers (e.g., AOL or NET.COM) and other similar information that we track in aggregate form. The non-personally identifiable information that we track is anonymous and will never be identified with or lead us back to any of our visitors.

Cookie technology helps us to know how many people visit us and where visitors go on our site as well as being the sole means that we can operate our shopping basket feature. Cookies are small bits of information we send to your computer. Among other things, this non-personally identifiable information allows us to know which areas are favourites, which areas need a bit of improvement, or what technologies and Internet services are being used by our visitors so that we may continually improve our visitors’ online experiences.

###  USE OF IP ADDRESSES

We collect IP addresses to obtain aggregate information on the use of SCHOLASTIC.CO.UK and its subsidiary sites. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by a Web server when you’re on the Web. When you are on our site, we have a server that logs your computer’s IP address. We only use the information we find out from tracking IP addresses in the aggregate, such as how many users entered a specific area of our site, and not to track a specific IP address to identify an individual user. However, we may use such information to identify a user if we feel that there are or may be safety and/or security issues or to comply with legal requirements.

###  SECURITY

Scholastic UK Ltd ensures that all personally and non-personally identifiable information that it receives via the Internet is secure against unauthorised access. This information is kept in a safe and secure system isolated from direct connection to the Internet. We may disclose personally identifiable information to service providers who manage aspects of our operations. We will give out personal information as required by law, or to assist in criminal investigations. We may also give out personal information when we deem it advisable in order to protect the safety and security of our sites and visitors to our sites.

###  WHY WE ARE SAFE

Scholastic uses secure server software over a 128bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) line to protect your credit card information. It encrypts all of your personal and credit card information so that this information cannot be read as it travels to our ordering system, and once it is received, it is stored in a location not accessible via the Internet and then destroyed after the successful completion of the transaction.

By disclosing your information to Scholastic UK Ltd, you agree to the collection, storage and processing of your personal information in the manner set out here.
