ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, “The Planet”), respects
the privacy and security of its customers and users of its website. The Planet strives to provide you with a
personalized internet experience that delivers to you the information, products and services that you need.
In order to achieve this goal, The Planet sometimes collects information during your visits to our website. We
will not disclose this information to any person or organization outside The Planet, except as described in
this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is not intended to and does not create any contractual or other legal
rights in or on behalf of any party.
We have prepared this Privacy Policy to enable you to understand which personal identifying information of
yours is collected, how and when we might use your information, how we protect your information, who has
access to your information, and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.
Information We Collect
The Planet collects certain information from and about its users three ways: (i) from our web server logs, (ii)
with cookies and (iii) directly from the user.
Web server logs: When you visit our website, The Planet may collect information to administer the site and
analyze its usage. The Planet may collect information such as:
      •   your Internet protocol address ;
      •   the type of browser or computer you use;
      •   the number of links you click within our website;
      •   the state or country from which you accessed our website;
      •   the date and time of your visit;
      •   the name of your Internet service provider;
      •   the Web page from which you linked to our website; and
      •   the pages you viewed on our website
Cookies: The Planet’s website use cookies (i.e., small bits of text that our servers place into a file on your
computer's hard drive). We use cookies to save your preferences and login information, and provide
personalized functionality. You can reject cookies by changing your browser settings, but be aware that this
will disable some of the functionality on The Planet’s website.
Personal information users give us: On some pages of our website, users can register to purchase
products or services, receive personalized content and participate in surveys or forums. When you register,
The Planet may ask you for some personal information.
If you're purchasing products or services, we may also request financial information such as credit card or
bank account information. Any financial information we collect is used only to bill you for the products and
services you purchased. If you purchase by credit card, this information may be forwarded to your credit
card provider. For other types of registrations, we will ask for your name, address, e-mail address or
telephone number. We may then contact you with information about The Planet’s products and services.
As a security measure and to ensure that our website and computer network remain available to all
customers, The Planet may use software programs to monitor network traffic or to identify unauthorized
attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. These software programs may also
collect information regarding your use of our website and computer network.

You may also be asked to disclose personal information to us so that we can provide technical support
assistance and information to you. For example, we may collect personal information from you (such as an
e-mail address, system information and problem descriptions) in order to provide online technical support
and troubleshooting. If you choose to correspond with us through electronic communication (e.g. email,
online chat or instant messaging), we may retain a copy of the electronic communication together with your
email address and our responses. We provide the same protections for these electronic communications
that we employ in the maintenance of information received by mail and telephone.
Finally, some pages of the Planet’s website may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, news groups
or instant messaging available to you. Please remember that any information disclosed in these areas is
public. You should exercise caution when disclosing personal information in these areas. Don't disclose
information in these public forums that might be considered confidential – such as financial information,
social security numbers, passwords or email addresses. Users should be aware that when they voluntarily
disclose personally identifiable information on the bulletin boards or in the chat areas, that information and
any substantive information disclosed in the communication can be collected and used by third parties. This
could result in unsolicited messages from others who post on such sites and are beyond the control of The
Planet.
How We Use Your Information
The Planet uses the information we collect to notify you about your account and to notify you about changes
to the terms and conditions governing your use of our website, products and services. We may also use
the information we collect to notify you about other products and services we think you will find valuable and
about special offers. You may notify us of your desire not to receive notifications relating to new products
and services and special offers by “opting-out” as provided for below.
The Planet may also provide aggregate information about our customers, this website’s traffic patterns and
related website usage information to our affiliates and reputable third parties, but this information will not
include personally identifying data. We take measures to select product or service providers that are
responsible and afford similar privacy protections to their customers. However, we do not make any
representations about the practices and policies of these companies.
If you don't want to receive promotional materials from The Planet or our marketing partners, you
may opt out at any time. You may "opt out" by clicking on the box marked "I DO NOT WISH TO RECEIVE
SPECIAL COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE PLANET" when you register for an account or at any time
afterwards by contacting us at info@theplanet.com. Upon properly opting-out, The Planet will take
reasonable efforts to delete a user's personal information from its database. However, please note that it
may be impossible to entirely delete a user's information because some residual information may reside on
backups or records of deletions.
How We Protect Your Information
The Planet uses technical security measures to prevent the loss, misuse, alteration or unauthorized
disclosure of information under our control.
When we ask customers or users to provide financial information (such as a credit card number) that data is
protected using Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) technology. However, please note that electronic
communication (e.g. email, online chat or instant messaging) that you may send to us may not be secure
unless we advise you in advance that security measures will be in place prior to your transmitting the
information. For that reason, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as financial
information, social security numbers or passwords to us through unsecured electronic communication.
Access to Your Information
The Planet will share or disclosure your personal data in four ways:
     •    as required by law, in a matter of public safety or policy, or as compelled by a court of law;
     •    with other affiliates or partners of The Planet (as described above);
     •    with agents and contractors who use such information on behalf of The Planet or in connection with
          administering or delivering products and services on behalf of The Planet; and
     •    as needed in connection with the transfer of business assets.
