# Privacy Policy - TheSite.org

### YouthNet UK, owner of TheSite.org, takes your privacy very seriously.

Under the Data Protection Act 1998, YouthNet UK is known as a “Data Controller”. In simple terms, this means that we determine what personal information about you is collected and what it will be used for.

In a situation where information is collected, you will be told what is being collected and for what purpose we will use it. We will store it in line with Data Protection Act 1998 guidelines. We do not sell, rent, share, or otherwise disclose personally identifiable information with any other parties.

We understand that anonymity is extremely important in some areas of TheSite, particularly our discussion boards and our Ask A Question service. We have a general [confidentiality policy](https://web.archive.org/about-us/confidentiality) that applies to all areas where young people interact with us.

Please read our Ask A Question [privacy guide](https://web.archive.org/about-us/ask-a-question-service-privacy-policy) to find out specifically how your data is stored and used regarding this service.

### How and why we collect user data:

### Polls

When we run polls on TheSite.org we use “cookies”. These are small data files that we send to your Internet browser, which are stored on your computer’s hard-drive and subsequently “read back” if you visit TheSite.org again.  This enables us to recognise you when you return and to know if you have already voted.  The only information stored is your IP address.

You can set your Internet browser to reject cookies. However, if you do some functions of the site may not work properly. In order to do this, please follow the instructions in our [Cookies Policy](https://web.archive.org/about-us/cookies-policy).

### Discussion boards

Registration to our discussion boards requires a user to provide certain basic information, including a valid email address. Whilst this information will not be passed on to any third parties, we may need it to enable use to administer the site and if necessary, contact a particular user.

Cookies are also used in connection with the discussion boards to provide users with a better experience by recognising the user and informing him or her of which postings are new since the previous visit. Cookies can be disabled by following the instructions in our [Cookies Policy.](https://web.archive.org/about-us/cookies-policy)

### Mailing lists and our newsletter

You can subscribe to our mailing list by providing a valid email address at the appropriate point. TheSite.org will only use email addresses to send relevant information, for example about new content and/or promotions. We will not pass your data on to third parties unconnected with TheSite.org. Users may unsubscribe simply by requesting to do so by email.

### Surveys

TheSite.org may run online surveys from time to time to find out how we can improve our services and to find out our user’s views on topic areas connected with our work – for example drinking or self harm. Users may be asked to provide some basic demographic information, as well as answers to a series of questions.

Occasionally, we may incentivise surveys through the use of a promotion, such as a free prize draw, in which case we may ask for an email address so we can contact the winners.

Survey answers and responses are generally handled in anonymous or aggregate form. Individuals’ specific answers are not disclosed to third parties, however aggregated data may sometimes be passed on in the form of a press release.

### Competitions

TheSite.org may run competitions in which we ask users to supply us with postal address details in case they are chosen as a winner.

### Google Analytics and cookies

The Site.org uses Google Analytics to gather non-personal information on our visitors. This information helps us understand where our website traffic is coming from, what articles and videos are being viewed and for how long. This is done through cookies and code which is embedded on our websites. For more information please see our [Cookies Policy.](https://web.archive.org/about-us/cookies-policy)
