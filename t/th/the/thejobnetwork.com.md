TheJobNetwork is aware of the sensitive nature of employment information and is committed to providing its users with high standards of online security and privacy protection. The following Privacy Statement presents our online data collection and usage policies and practices. This site is powered by a service and technology provided by The Job Network LLC. ("RM"), which powers employment sites in North America. 

Registration on this site is voluntary, and is designed for the purpose of seeking employment. Upon registration the site collects your email address and other personal information (such as employment skills) in a "profile." In your profile, you are NOT required to include your name or contact information. Your email address is required, however, so that you may be contacted for employment opportunities, or in case we need to contact you regarding site changes or information about your account. When you apply for a position, however, you need to provide your name and full contact information; this information is shared only with the employer to whom you applied. However, if you maintain a resume as part of your profile, the information in this resume may be viewed by employers other than those to whom you have specifically applied. 

In order to provide you with the broadest exposure to potential employment opportunities, information you place in your profile may be shared with RM affiliated companies or within other sites powered by RM. Neither RM nor its affiliates distributes personal information for advertising purposes. 

RM attempts to limit access to the searchable resume database only to potential employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals. However, WE DO NOT AND CAN NOT guarantee that other parties (including parties disguised as employers) will not gain access to this database. Therefore, RM and TheJobNetwork hereby specifically exclude any responsibility and or liability related to the use made of resumes by third parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable database. 

You reserve the right to review, update, change or deactivate your account provided however that RM and TheJobNetwork will not be responsible for the retention, use or privacy of resumes or profiles in these situations nor liable in connection therewith. This site contains links to other websites over which we have no jurisdiction. RM and TheJobNetwork are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other websites to which you choose to link from this website. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those other websites so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information. 

This site works with third parties, including advertising companies and website analysis firms, who use cookies to collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("Non-PII") when you visit our Site and third party sites about your surfing activities. This Non-PII, collected through cookies, is typically used by these third party advertising networks to serve you with advertisements while on third party sites tailored to meet your preferences and likely interests.
