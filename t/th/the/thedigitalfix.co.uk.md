# Privacy Policy | Misc Content | The Digital Fix

This privacy policy sets out how The Digital Fix, and by extension Poisonous Monkey Ltd, uses and protects any information that you supply when you use this website.

We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. Should we ask you to provide certain information by which you can be identified when using this website, then you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement.

We may change this policy from time to time by updating this page. You should check this page from time to time to ensure that you are happy with any changes. This policy is effective from 10th May 2012.

We try to ensure we only request and store information that is essential for your use of this site and it is our intention to keep personally identifiable information to a minimum. It is our recommendation that when signing up to use our services such as commenting and forums you use a pseudonym rather than your real name.

 **What we collect**

Your 'username'  
Contact information limited to your email address  
Your date of birth

When using social networking accounts or third party authentication, we only request the bare minimum to allow us to authenticate you - this is, in most cases, the unique ID that identifies you as a user on the linked sites.

We also store the IP addresses you use to access the site. These are for our own security and are not used or provided to any third party unless required to by court order.

 **What we do with the information we gather**

We require this information to understand your needs and provide you with a better service, and in particular for the following reasons:

• Internal record keeping.   
• We may use the information to improve our products and services.   
• We may periodically send promotional emails about new products, special offers or other information which we think you may find interesting using the email address which you have provided. 

**Security**

We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical and electronic protection to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

No passwords are stored in plain text and we use a variety of encryption algorithms to ensure your data security. No administrator has access to your actual password at any time.

 **How we use cookies**

A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences. 

Cookies are a requirement of our comments and forums and neither will function correctly unless they are enabled.

We use third-party traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyse data about web page traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system. 

Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us. 

You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.

 **Links to other websites**

Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.

Our website contains some affiliate marketing links, which means we get paid commission on sales of those products or services we write about. Our editorial content is not influenced by advertisers or affiliate partnerships. We use a 3rd Party to enable these affiliate partnerships. You can read their [Privacy Policy](http://skimlinks.com/privacy-policy#users) and find more information on [the cookies they use](http://skimlinks.com/user-cookies)

We also run third party banner advertisements that are governed by the 'AdChoices' guidelines. Usually referred to as "online behavioral advertising," standard information gathered through your browser is used to show advertising that is more likely to interest you. If you would like to learn more about these practices and make choices about the third parties' use of information collected, including opting out of such collection and use, please go to <http://www.aboutads.info/choices>.

 **Controlling your personal information**

You may choose to restrict the collection or use of your personal information in the following ways:

• whenever you are asked to fill in a form on the website, look for the box that you can click to indicate that you do not want the information to be used by anybody for direct marketing purposes  
• if you have previously agreed to us using your personal information for direct marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time by [Contacting Us](https://web.archive.org/sendmail.php).

We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so. We may use your personal information to send you promotional information about third parties which we think you may find interesting if you tell us that you wish this to happen.

You may request details of personal information which we hold about you under the Data Protection Act 1998. A small fee of £10 will be payable via paypal or cheque made payable to "Poisonous Monkey Ltd". If you would like a copy of the information held on you please write to Poisonous Monkey Ltd, 10 Maple Close, Melksham, SN12 7JP. For the vast majority of users we DO NOT STORE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION and at present we do not require you to supply any information that is personally identifiable - and if you decide to do so yourself via comments or forum posts we cannot be held responsible and such voluntarily supplied information is not required to be supplied to you under the Data Protection Act 1998. 

You have the right to select a suitably anonymous username and, as such, if you do elect to use your full real name this is done voluntarily and we do not class this as personally identifying data unless your name is unusual enough to be considered reasonably unique. Once a username is selected we will not usually change it unless there are extreme extenuating circumstances.

If you believe that any information we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, please write to or [contact us](https://web.archive.org/sendmail.php) as soon as possible, at the above address. We will promptly correct any information found to be incorrect.
