### How is our registration data used?

Some content on TheServerSide.com such as PDF downloads and also the ability to post/respond to messages require a user to be 'logged in' and therefore registered. 

Our site's registration process requests that users give us contact information (such as their name and email address), unique identifiers for authentication (such as username and password), and demographic information that pertains to their profession such as business industry and job function. 

We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user relevant information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners, but only to those who opt to receive it. These messages are approved and delivered by us, and we never allow email addresses or other contact information out of our control. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailing. The user's contact information is also used to contact the user when necessary, for the administration of prizes, rewards, or to respond to customer service requests. Unique identifiers such as passwords, are collected to verify the user's identity.

Whether you want to receive these announcement lists is your choice; you should only receive those lists you affirmatively choose to. If you choose to receive a specific announcement list, you will receive commercial messages that are related to the topic of the list from independent third parties that have contracted with TheServerSide.com to send messages to the list.

[ Why it is easy for the quality of Open Source Projects to be bad ](https://web.archive.org/discussion/thread.jsp?thread_id=22300)

Cameron Purdy started a blogfest with his original piece, gratuitously titled, "Why does Open Source suck?". He is a little sick at how some people see projects that are open source as automatically superior. He talks about how a GREAT developer is few and far between, and how anyone can fill out a form on sf.net.

Kris Thompson comments on the SDTimes article ".NET Progress Worries Java". Kris hits out at the constant claim that Visual Studio.NET is the best thing since sliced bread, and that J2EE is ugly and complicated.
