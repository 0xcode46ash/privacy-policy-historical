# Privacy Policy and Disclosures

_We are required by law to post this information on our site._

## The Write Life Privacy Policy

When you subscribe to our newsletter or leave a comment, The Write Life collects information from you: your name, email address, and maybe your social media profiles. You may, however, visit our site anonymously if you’d prefer.

Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:

  * Personalize your experience (your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs)
  * Improve our website (we continually strive to improve our website offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you)
  * Administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature
  * Send periodic email updates with helpful information



The email address you provide may be used to send you information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions — but only with your permission, of course.

**We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information.** This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.

We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.

## Full Disclosure

The content of The Write Life is for general information purposes only and does not always constitute professional advice. Readers should understand that not all of our contributors are licensed professionals, and we encourage you to seek appropriate council before acting on any of our advice.

In accordance with the latest FTC guidelines, we declare that we have a financial or mutually beneficial relationship with the brands or products mentioned on this site.

By using our site, you consent to this privacy policy and disclosure statements.
