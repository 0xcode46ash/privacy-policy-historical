# Privacy Policy

                                      Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to the following websites (jointly and severally referred to herein as "the
Site"): www.LAIKA.com, www.coraline.com, www.paranorman.com and www.theboxtrolls.com. The
Site is owned, operated, licensed or controlled by LAIKA, LLC. ("LAIKA"). We know that you care
about how information about you is used and shared, and your privacy is of the utmost importance
to LAIKA. We promise that we will use information about you carefully and sensibly. This Privacy
Policy describes the information that we collect about visitors to our Site, how we use that
information and how we protect that information. It also discusses certain choices you have
regarding your personal information. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected on this
Site and does not apply to information collected by LAIKA through any other means.
BY USING THIS SITE, YOU CONSENT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND
TO OUR PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES STATED BELOW. IF YOU DO
NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE
SITE.
POLICY REGARDING CHILDREN
Overview. We at LAIKA believe it essential that parents are involved in their children’s online
experiences. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires us to inform parents
and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from children less
than 13 years of age. This Section describes our practices with respect to information we collect
from you, as well as from your child. Under COPPA, we may not, and we do not, condition your
child's participation in any LAIKA activity on the provision of more information than is reasonably
necessary for your child to participate in that activity. This Section is in addition to the other
provisions of this Privacy Policy, which will continue to apply.
Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, or for purposes of facilitating internal operations of
the Site, we do not collect information about you or your child when you visit our Site unless you
choose to provide information to us. When the Site needs to collect information about a child under
13 years old, COPPA required information and instructions will be provided by the specific Site page
that collects information about the child. The Site page will specify exactly what the information
will be used for, who will see it, and how long it will be kept.
There are several exceptions that permit collection of a child's email address without receiving
parental consent in advance:
•        To provide the parents with notice and to seek consent for communications with the child.
Note: this may require collection of the parent's email address as well.
•        To respond to a one time request from a child.
•        To provide support for internal operations.
•        To respond more than once to a child's request; i.e., subscription to a newsletter. However,
parental consent is required prior to the second communication.
•        To protect the safety of a child who is participating on the site; i.e., in a chat room.
To protect the site or to respond to law enforcement; i.e., in the case the Site is compromised.


PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Automatically Generated Information. Whenever you visit the Site, we receive and store
information about that visit. For example, we obtain information about you and your Web
browser, including:
•        The Internet Protocol (IP) address that connects your computer to the Internet;
•        Your email address and confirmation when you open an email sent from the Site;
•        Your user name(s) and password(s);
•        Your browser type and version, operating system and platform, and other computer and
connection information;
•        The date, time and full Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) of your clicks to, through and
from the Site;
•        Services you search for on the Site, view and/or use; and
•        Sections of the Site you visit.
There are companies that provide tools that allow you to visit websites anonymously. While use of
these tools may prevent us from providing you with personalized service, you should be aware that
this option is available.
Information You Provide. When you visit our Site, you may be asked to provide personally
identifiable information in order to take advantage of the products and services offered through the
Site, including without limitation: your name, address, birth date, telephone and fax numbers,
email address, credit card information, and communication preferences. Of course, we also collect
the information that you choose to provide when you submit a transmission or other materials to the
Site. You may always choose not to provide the information we request; however, you may then be
unable to take advantage of the features and services we offer on our Site. If you are under 13 years
of age, you and your parent must review the section below titled “Policy Regarding Children”, which
will govern your provision of personally identifiable information.
Information from other Sources. From time to time we may purchase or otherwise acquire
information about you from other sources and add it to our database, including updated
address information, customer lists, email address lists, etc.
HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We understand that your personally identifiable information is private and confidential. That’s why
we want you to know what information we need to offer our services to you, and how we use that
information. We use information about you in order to provide the services described in our Site,
and for internal operations. In addition, we may share customer information with our affiliates and
as described below.
No Sale of Personal Information. Be assured that we will not sell your personal information to
others except in connection with a sale of our assets, or a change in control transaction involving
LAIKA.
Third Party Service Providers. We may, from time to time, engage others to provide services to
LAIKA, to you, and to other visitors to our Site. For example, we may engage other companies to
host, operate and maintain our Site, analyze data, and provide marketing assistance. We will give
those service providers access to your personal information, but only to the extent necessary to do
their jobs. Although we use reasonable precautions to ensure that our third party service providers
protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee that those companies will protect your
personal information to the same extent described in this Privacy Policy.
Statistical Information. LAIKA shares some information about its visitors with business partners,
sponsors and other third parties; however, that information is statistical in nature, it is aggregated,
and does not identify specific individuals.
Emails. From time to time, we may send you email messages, to keep you apprised of your, Site
developments, to inform you of new offers, and to deliver email newsletters to which you have


subscribed. We may use a bulk email service to distribute that information. Included in each of
these messages are simple instructions on how to remove yourself from these mailings if you do not
wish to receive them in the future.
Mailings. If you supply us with your postal address, you may receive periodic mailings from LAIKA,
with information on new products and services, or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive
such mailings, please let us know via e-mail at ask_laika@laika.com.
Other Disclosures/Use. There are some situations where we may need to disclose information to
organizations or entities not described in our Privacy Policy here. We will disclose your personal
information if we believe, in good faith, that it is required to do so: (a) by law or to comply with a
subpoena or court order; (b) to protect and defend our rights or property; or (c) in an emergency
to protect the personal safety of our customers, visitors or the public.
COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS
Upon your first visit to our Site, our Site may send a “cookie” to your computer. “Cookies” are
alphanumeric identifiers that we place on your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to
enable our servers to recognize your browser. A cookie is a file that identifies you as a unique user,
and while it does store personal preferences and user data, a cookie does not identify you by name.
We use cookies on our Site to help provide you with a more personalized browsing experience, and
to help us better understand and improve our Site and its services. While you are free to disable
cookies on your browser to use our Site, some of our features may not work if cookies are disabled.
For example, without cookies, you may not be able to set customized searches, personalized
preferences or other customized preferences.
Our Site may also use “Web beacons” in conjunction with cookies to compile aggregate statistics
about Site usage. A “Web beacon” is an electronic image, called a single-pixel (1×1) or clear GIF.
Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as your cookie
number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is
placed. We use these Web beacons to tailor our Site to provide better customer service. These
Web beacons often work in conjunction with cookies but browsers can be set to refuse cookies or
to provide warning whenever cookies are being received.
Do Not Track Signals
Some web browsers have “do not track settings.” These are not yet uniform across the industry and
our Sites are not built to respond to those browser signals. We do not participate in practices
known as “behavioral advertising” or tracking users across other websites. As such, we do not
participate in the behavioral advertising do not track programs. If you have any questions, please
contact us at ask_laika@laika.com, or by phone at 503-225-1130.

Those other website may not have privacy policies or may have privacy policies that are not as
protective of your personal information as this Privacy Policy. These other websites may send
their own cookies to visitors, collect data or solicit personal information. We strongly recommend

those website directly or through a link from a page on our Site.

first collect your (the parent's) email address and use this information to contact you (the parent) by
email to notify you that your child wishes to provide personally identifiable information to us,
describe the purposes for which the personally identifiable information is collected, and provide you
an opportunity to opt-out of the collection of the information. The email will include details on how
the parent may (i) provide LAIKA with consent; (ii) prohibit LAIKA from any further contact with the
child; or (iii) delete the child's personally identifiable information. You have the option to consent
to the collection and use of your child's personally identifiable information without consenting to

from a child. Parents may also contact us at any time to request that we delete the personally
identifiable information of a child or a parent and/or refuse to permit further collection or use of a
child's information. We will take steps to ensure that any person contacting us for a child's
information is that child's parent or guardian. If we become aware that we have inadvertently
