## What happens when you visit our website?

We need this information to help us understand how people are using our website, and to make sure our website is secure.

We do our analytics using services from Innocraft, Ltd, a privacy friendly analytics service which we have been using for the last couple of years on a self hosted base in The Netherlands.

We store all of this data for a period of three months. We do so because we want to make sure our website operates effectively and securely.

We also use cookies to track you on our website. You can read more about these cookies below.

## What happens when you contribute to our campaign?

When you become a member of The Correspondent - for which we thank you very much! - the following happens to your data. Through the [signup form](https://thecorrespondent.com/join), we collect the following information about you:

  * _Your first name, last name, and email address_. We use this information to address you personally in our communications (for example, when we send you an email). We store this data for you to start using the platform as soon as we launch. In case the campaign doesn’t succeed we store your data for a period of up to three months after our crowdfunding campaign ends. We do this so we can communicate with you as a much-valued member. If we reach our campaign goal, your email address will also give you access to The Correspondent when it launches before mid-2019.
  *  _The country you live in_. We are legally obliged to collect this information to determine which tax laws apply to your membership contribution. We also use this information to get an overview of where our subscribers are based. This information helps us understand a little more about who are members are, so we can develop The Correspondent with your needs and interests in mind.
  *  _The donation amount, currency and whether you want this donation to be recurring_. We use this information to process your donation and to track our progress towards our fundraising goal. If you indicated that you want your donation to recur annually, we’ll use this information to process your payment in future years.



We also send this information to Stripe, Inc., based in San Francisco. We use Stripe to process payments and to perform analytics. Stripe collects identifying information about the devices that connect to its services. They use this information to operate and improve the services it provides to us, including for fraud detection. You can learn more about Stripe and read its privacy policy [here](https://stripe.com/nl/privacy).

The data that Stripe collects and shares with The Correspondent depends on the payment method. In case of paying by..

  * .. credit card or debit card, Stripe collects your card number, expiry date, CVC number, the name of the card holder and the zip code in case of a US card. Stripe then provides The Correspondent with the last four digits of your card number, the expiry date, the name of the card holder, the brand and the issuing country.
  * .. iDeal or Bancontact, you will be referred to the payment processors website. We forward the payment processor your name, the reference of the payment and the amount to be paid. You can then authorise the transaction, after which we receive an update from the payment processor on whether the transaction succeeded or failed. Stripes then provides The Correspondent the name of the bank, the BIC, the name of the account holder and the bank account number.
  * .. Google Pay, Apple Pay or Microsoft Pay, Stripe collects the payment credentials from the issuer. Stripe then provides The Correspondent with the last four digits or your credit card or debit card, the expiry date, the name of the card holder, the card brand and the issuing country. In case you don’t have a credit card or debit card connected to the issuer, Stripe shares a unique identifier with The Correspondent.



We’re required to store this data for seven years after your last contribution to the crowdfunding campaign.

## Do you share my information with the Dutch-language platform De Correspondent?

The membership campaign we’re running from November 14 to December 14 is operated by The Correspondent, Inc. But our website and related database are hosted by De Correspondent B.V., a Dutch legal entity which forms part of the same group as The Correspondent, Inc. The Correspondent, Inc. is a joint controller with regard to the data together processed in the context of this campaign together with De Correspondent B.V.. The Correspondent, Inc. is the primary contact point for enquiries and is obliged to inform you on privacy-related matters.

After we reach our fundraising goal and The Correspondent is launched, we’ll integrate our English-language platform The Correspondent and our Dutch-language platform De Correspondent into one digital infrastructure. This also means that we’ll combine the database of members of The Correspondent, Inc. with current members of De Correspondent B.V. we’ll always make sure that the data remains within the Correspondent-group and your privacy is respected. We have also created a legal structure to ensure we remain dedicated to our mission and safeguard your trust. You can read more about how we do this [here](https://medium.com/de-correspondent/how-the-correspondent-protects-itself-from-profit-maximization-df7b316e8ab7).

## What information do you collect if I invite someone via your website to become a member?

Members can become an ambassador for The Correspondent by recruiting new members. If they do so through _Win a Portrait_ or the _Member Wall_ , we save their participation. We also track who became a member through you. We store this data for a period of up to three months after our crowdfunding campaign. This helps us grow our movement for unbreaking news, as each member brings us one step closer to making The Correspondent a reality.

You can read more about the terms and conditions of _Win a Portrait_ [here](https://web.archive.org/terms).

## What happens when I subscribe to a newsletter?

On many pages of our website, you can sign up for our _keep-me-posted newsletter_. We’ll only send you our newsletter if you give us permission to do so. To subscribe, we ask you for your email address. When you contribute to the crowdfunding campaign, you’re automatically subscribed to our _member newsletter_. You can unsubscribe from our newsletters by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom. We store this information for a period of up to three months after you unsubscribe or until we discontinue the newsletter.

We send our newsletters using MailChimp. MailChimp is a service that allows us to create and send emails to large numbers of people at once. Newsletters sent with MailChimp track when a recipient opened an email or clicked on certain links. MailChimp records each subscriber's email address, IP address, plus the date and time for each open and click. MailChimp uses this data to create reports for The Correspondent about how well a newsletter was read and by whom. You can read the privacy policy of MailChimp [here](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/).

## What happens after the campaign is a success?

If you’re a member, you get a one-year membership to The Correspondent. When we launch, we’ll let you know more about our approach to privacy in our privacy statement, but we can already share our basic privacy principles with you:

  * We only collect data if we are legally obliged to do so or if this is necessary for the functioning of our platform;
  * We do not sell this data to others;
  * We’ll always explain the purpose of our data collection clearly to our members; and
  * Members should where possible have control over their data

If you have a request, please send it to [hello@thecorrespondent.com](mailto:hello@thecorrespondent.com) and we’ll get back to you quickly.
