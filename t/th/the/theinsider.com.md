**Privacy Statement for The Insider Travel Network**

**The Insider Travel Network** has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: [The Insider Travel Network ](http://www.theinsider.com/)

#### Information Automatically Logged 

We use your IP address to gather broad demographic information. This information helps us to develop content that is most appropriate for the readers of The Insider travel guides. It also helps us attract advertisers, allowing us to provide this content to you on the web for free. Please note that we only use this information in the aggregate and do not attempt to trace individual readers via IP information.

#### Cookies 

Our Site uses cookies to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. We do not use cookies for any other purpose. If you choose to decline acceptance of a cookie, there will be no change in the way that content is presented to you. We do hope, however, that you will choose to accept cookies, since serving multiple ads to each user helps this advertiser-supported site remain free to web users.

#### Advertisers 

We use several different orgranizations to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and we do not have access to this information. 

One of the orgranizations we work with is Flycast, a third party that serves ads to this site. To find out more about how Flycast manages the privacy of information in conjunction with serving ads on this site, please go to [http://www.flycast.com/about_us/about-privacy.html](http://www.flycast.com/about_us/about-privacy.html).

Another organization we work with that serves ads to this site is Advertisig.com. You can find their privacy policy at [http://www.advertising.com/privacy/index.html](http://www.advertising.com/privacy/index.html).

#### Registration Forms 

Our site's registration form sometimes requires users to give us contact information (like their name, email, and postal address), and demographic information (like their zip code, or profession). The Insider Travel Network works with a third party that hosts our e-mail newsletters and serves ads into this publication. To find out more about how Flycast manages the privacy of information in conjunction with hosting and serving ads into our newsletters, please go to [http://edispatch.flycast.com/privacy](http://edispatch.flycast.com/privacy). 

Contact information from the registration forms is used to ship purchases, mail follow-up information about our company, and to send promotional material from some of our partners to our readers. The reader's contact information is also used to get in touch with the individual when necessary and to share with other companies who may want to contact our customers. 

Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. 

Demographic and profile data is also sometimes collected at our site. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. 

#### Surveys 

Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like email address), and demographic information (like zip code, age, or income level). 

Contact information from the surveys is used to ship purchases, mail follow-up information about our company, and to send promotional material from some of our partners to our customers. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary, and to share with other companies who may want to contact our visitors. 

Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.

#### External Links 

This site contains links to other sites. **The Insider Travel Guides Network** is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

#### Special Relationships 

The Insider Travel Guides Network has partnerships with three different organizations. In each case, we have chosen to work with these other companies because they provide special services that we could not provide on our own. For example, our relationship with TravelNow allows you to make hotel reservations, car rental reservations, and international airline reservations via a series of co-branded pages. TravelNow collects information from you and makes the appropriate travel arrangements on your behalf. TravelNow also sends us the contact information you provide so that we can add you to our mailing list. (See the "opt-out" information below to learn how you can prevent your name from being added to our list.)

We also have content relationships with VaultReports and Insider Shopping. In both cases, you may be asked to provide information as you peruse these co-branded pages, but we do not have access to or control over any of the information you provide.

#### Public Forums 

This site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
