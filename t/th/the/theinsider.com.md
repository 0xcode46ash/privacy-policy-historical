If you choose to decline acceptance of a cookie, there will be no change in the way that content is presented to you. We do hope, however, that you will choose to accept cookies, since serving multiple ads to each user helps this advertiser-supported site remain free to web users.

Contact information from the registration forms can be used to ship purchases, mail follow-up information about our company, and to send promotional material from some of our partners to our readers. The reader's contact information is also used to get in touch with the individual when necessary and to share with other companies who may want to contact our customers.

We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. 

#### Surveys

Contact information from the surveys is used to ship purchases or rewards, mail follow-up information about our company, and to send promotional material from some of our partners to our customers. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary, and to share with other companies who may want to contact our visitors.
