On occasion, The Crimson Online also collects additional personal information from subscribers in optional contest and survey forms.

The Crimson Online also logs IP addresses, or the location of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. We may also use IP address logs to track your participation in our readership polls in order to ensure accurate results. General demographical information automatically available about users when they connect to our website may also be gathered for statistical purposes.

The Crimson Online does collect information in aggregate form that we may, from time to time, provide to advertisers and other third parties. If and when this is done, The Crimson Online will not include any identifiable individual information.
