 **About Personal Information sent through eNewsletter Subscriptions and Shopping Transactions**

 **hbc.com** does not share personal information that you provide, including customer names, eMail addresses or other information required for shopping transactions or eMail subscriptions (eNewsletters), with any outside organizations for their own marketing or promotional purposes. Your personal information is used in the completion of transactions, which you have requested. Please review Fraud Prevention below and [Terms and Conditions](javascript:onClick=Bay_openBrWindow\('http://www.hbc.com/hbc/legal_terms/legal.asp','hbc','toolbar=yes,location=yes,status=yes,menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=600,height=400'\)) to understand how this personal information is used.

**eNewsletters**

 **hbc.com** may work with outside organizations as technical resources for eMailing **hbc.com** 's marketing campaigns and our eNewsletter subscription service. In conducting these marketing campaigns and our eNewsletter service, these outside organizations may use cookies on our behalf. For more information about cookies, please refer to our [cookies page](javascript:onClick=Bay_openBrWindow\('/HBCONLINE/help/customerservice/default.asp?langid=EN&catid=&imgthumb=False&choice=3&dsection=9&pg=technical&page%5Fname=TechnicalTitle%5FLabel&page%5Flabel=cookies','hbc','toolbar=yes,location=yes,status=yes,menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=600,height=400'\)). We will provide these outside organizations with the relevant subscriber information to successfully send out eNewsletters, such as eMail addresses. Any outside organization that does assist us with eNewsletters has agreed not to use or disclose such information for any other purpose.

Customers who choose to voluntarily opt in to receive a **hbc.com** eNewsletter will receive occasional eMails that outline store and site specials, plus other information. Due to the regional nature of Bay and Zellers' promotions, **hbc.com** may also request a postal code from subscribers to match store specials within their regions. Aside from postal code and eMail address, the only other personal information requested from subscribers is a name. 

**Surveys**

**hbc.com** may conduct online surveys, from time to time, to assist us in understanding, among other things, who our customers are and what their shopping preferences are. **hbc.com** will compile and summarize the information collected with information received from other customers. This compiled and summarized information will not contain information that directly or indirectly identifies any individuals. We may work with outside organizations as technical resources for administering and analyzing the results of these surveys. In conducting these surveys, these outside organizations may use cookies on our behalf. For more information about cookies, please refer to our [cookies page](javascript:onClick=Bay_openBrWindow\('/HBCONLINE/help/customerservice/default.asp?langid=EN&catid=&imgthumb=False&choice=3&dsection=9&pg=technical&page%5Fname=TechnicalTitle%5FLabel&page%5Flabel=cookies','hbc','toolbar=yes,location=yes,status=yes,menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=600,height=400'\)). We will provide these outside organizations with the relevant subscriber information to successfully send out online surveys, such as eMail addresses. Any outside organization that does assist us with surveys has agreed not to use or disclose such information for any other purpose. 

**Security**

For security of transactions, **hbc.com** uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, which encrypts any information you send to us electronically. The encryption process protects your information, such as your credit card number, billing and shipping information by scrambling it before it is sent to us from your computer.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while **hbc.com** strives to protect your personal information, we can not warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once **hbc.com** receives your transmission, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems. 

**Fraud Prevention**

**hbc.com** reserves the right to co-operate with local, provincial and national authorities in investigations of improper or unlawful activities and this may require the disclosure of personal information. We may also report to other organizations about improper or unlawful user activities on **hbc.com** and this reporting may include disclosure of personal information relating to those individuals conducting such improper or unlawful activities.

In addition, in order to protect you and **hbc.com** from fraudulent transactions, **hbc.com** may provide your online shopping related information to a reputable outside organization to perform address verification. This address verification is intended to ensure that the "bill to" address that you provide matches your credit card address. The outside organization does not store any personal information that **hbc.com** provides from shopping transactions. 

**Membership**

 **hbc.com** offers membership as a value-added optional service for its visitors.

To join, **hbc.com** will request personal information such as billing and shipping address, which is then stored on our secure servers. You choose a unique user name and password which acts as the security check to access this information whenever it is needed (for shopping transactions, for example).

We also offer the option, if you so desire, to cancel your membership. Upon such cancellation, at your request, we will remove personal information about you from our membership database. 

**Cookies**

Your web browser places cookie files on your computer's hard drive. **hbc.com** uses cookies to remember information you gave us so that you don't have to re-enter the information each time you visit **hbc.com**. Cookies also help us understand which areas of our site are popular by showing us how you and others use our site.
