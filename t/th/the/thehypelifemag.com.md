At TheHypeLifeMag.com, the privacy of our visitors is of extreme importance to us. This privacy policy document outlines the types of personal information is received and collected by TheHypeLifeMag.com and how it is used.

**1\. Information About Visitors to TheHypeLifeMag.com**

TheHypeLifeMag.com keeps track of TheHypeLifeMag.com, and pages our visitors view within TheHypeLifeMag.com, to enable TheHypeLifeMag.com to determine what sites and services are the most popular. This data can be used to deliver customized content and advertising to TheHypeLifeMag.com’s customers and other visitors to TheHypeLifeMag.com whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a specific subject area. TheHypeLifeMag.com’s service may automatically gather certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to TheHypeLifeMag.com and its pages, and TheHypeLifeMag.com will only use information gathered in this manner in the aggregate to enable TheHypeLifeMag.com to improve and better design TheHypeLifeMag.com.

Like many other Web sites, TheHypeLifeMag.com makes use of log files. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol ( IP ) addresses, type of browser, Internet Service Provider ( ISP ), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement around the site, and gather demographic information. IP addresses, and other such information are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable.

To facilitate the above, TheHypeLifeMag.com may use a technology called “cookies” – small files attached to your Web browser – which tell TheHypeLifeMag.com how and when pages in TheHypeLifeMag.com are visited, and by how many people. TheHypeLifeMag.com’s cookies do not collect personally identifiable information and do not combine information collected through cookies with other personally identifiable information, so users remain anonymous. TheHypeLifeMag.com may also provide statistical “ratings” information in the aggregate (and never about individual users personally) to TheHypeLifeMag.com’s partners about how visitors, collectively, use TheHypeLifeMag.com.
