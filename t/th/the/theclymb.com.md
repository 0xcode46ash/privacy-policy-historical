### Secure Ordering:

Protecting your online order information on theclymb.com is very important to us. In our shopping checkout process, we use Secure Socket Layering (SSL), the industry-standard encryption technology that ensures the safety and security of your online order. When the letters "http" in the URL address change to "https," the "s" indicates you are in a secure area employing SSL. Making a credit card purchase is just as safe on our Site as it is by telephone. But if you prefer to order merchandise from the website by phone, please call us toll-free at [1 (877) 464-6939](tel:1-800-837-5004). For our member service hours of operation visit [Member Service](https://web.archive.org/web/20170710235942id_/https%3A//www.theclymb.com/ccare_main.aspx).

### Information Collected:

  * **Information You Provide to Us**

In order to access this Site, you must first complete the registration process. During the registration process, we collect personal information such as your name and email address. Once you complete and submit your registration, you have opted-in to receive email communication from The Clymb.

When you choose to use certain other features of the Site, such as making purchases, we collect personal information, such as your phone number, billing and shipping addresses and credit card information, and we may also request additional personal information, such as your shopping preferences and demographics.

If you choose to invite an individual to join The Clymb, you will need to provide his/her name and email address. The Clymb stores this information to confirm qualifying orders attributable to your account and to track the results of the invitation referrals.

  * **Passively Collected Information**

In addition, we automatically gather certain information whenever you interact with the Site, such as the name of the domain from which you access the Internet, the date and time you access our Site, how frequently certain areas of the Site are visited, and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our Site. Like many web sites, we employ the use of "cookies", web beacons, tokens, and other similar technology. Most browsers can be set to prevent cookies or to notify you when one is being placed. The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies are necessary to utilize the Site. If you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or access any portion of the Site that requires you to Sign in. We use the information we collect to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our Site, their locations, search history, buying history and system performance to help us make our Site more useful to you.




### Mobile

When you access the Site via a mobile device, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as advertising, search results, and other personalized content. Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services if you so desire. Most likely, such options are located in the device's settings menu. Your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer should be able to assist you if you have any questions regarding how to turn off location services. 

### How We Use Your Information:

We will not share or disclose your information to anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. We use personally identifiable information in order to give you a more enjoyable and convenient shopping experience and to help us identify and/or provide information, products or services that may be of interest to you. We use your personally identifiable information to support and enhance your use of the Site and its features, including without limitation: fulfilling your order; providing customer service; tracking email invitations you send, and otherwise supporting your use of the Site. We may also track your past purchases to provide you with a personalized profile of your shopping history. In addition, we may notify you about new services or special promotional programs, or send you offers or information.

We also use non-personally identifiable information in the aggregate, so that we can improve the Site and for business and administrative purposes. We may also use or share aggregated data that contains no personally identifiable information with third parties for any purpose. 

### Who Do We Share Information With:

  * **Affiliated Businesses**

We work closely with affiliated businesses and in some cases, we operate stores, provide services, or sell product lines jointly with these businesses. You will be able to tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and when we share customer information related to those transactions with that third party.

  * **Third-Party Service Providers**

We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. In connection with their performance of services to maintain and operate the Site and specific features on the Site, certain trusted third parties may be permitted to access your information. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

Notwithstanding any other provision, we may also engage a third party partner for the purpose of identifying users and delivering to them interest-based content and advertisements. We may share information about you with our partners such as your name, postal address, email, or other identifier and may do so in non-human readable, de-identified, form to ensure the security of your information. To opt-out of third party cookies, please go to <http://www.aboutads.info/choices> or Your Online Choices at <http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk>.

  * **Business Transfers**

As we continue to grow, we might sell or buy companies, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets, but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the event that The Clymb, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. In such a circumstance the transferee would be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy.

  * **Protection of The Clymb and Others**

We reserve the right to disclose account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements, or when we, in our sole discretion, believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of The Clymb, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy. We also reserve the right to disclose information in order to comply with any subpoena, court order, administrative or governmental order, or any other requirement of law.

  * **With Your Consent**

Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

The Site encrypts your credit card number and other personal information using secure socket layer (SSL) technology to provide for the secure transmission of the information from your PC to our servers. In addition, only those employees and third parties who need access to your information in order to perform their duties are allowed such access. 

It is also important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your computer and passwords. For example, be sure to log out when finished using a shared computer.
