## Secure Ordering:

Protecting your online order information on TheClymb.com is very important to us. In our shopping checkout process, we use Secure Socket Layering (SSL), the industry-standard encryption technology that ensures the safety and security of your online order. When the letters "http" in the URL address change to "https," the "s" indicates you are in a secure area employing SSL. Making a credit card purchase is just as safe on the Site as it is by telephone. But if you prefer to order merchandise from the Site by phone, call toll-free [1 (877) 464-6936](tel:1-877-464-6936).
