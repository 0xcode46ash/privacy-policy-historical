### COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY THECLYMB.COM

The Clymb will explicitly ask when we collect information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information"). Your personal information collected during the registration process, such as name and email address, is used to create your account and grant you access to the site. The Clymb may collect additional information during the course of your experience when you elect to use other features of the site. Financial information that is collected is used to verify identity, and to bill either you or your company for purchases made. Demographic and profile data collected by The Clymb may be used to tailor the website or any requested email communications, and to display information that is more relevant to you. The Clymb also compiles demographic and product use information in the aggregate only. Information collected in aggregate may be used to improve the site and may be available to necessary third parties. Under no circumstances will The Clymb make any personal information about an individual user available to anyone. Your email address is used to only send you information that you have requested. The Clymb adheres strictly to permission-based email policy. The Clymb will not send you unsolicited email, commercial offers, or advertisements. Additionally we will not sell, rent, nor loan our contact lists or customer data to any outside firms. You may unsubscribe from any emails that you have requested at any time. Unsubscribe requests are fulfilled immediately and no further communications will be sent to users who have stated that they do not wish to receive the specified information. While IP addresses (address of a computer) are logged to track a user's session, the user's identity is anonymous. Tracking IP addresses gives The Clymb valuable information about which parts of our site are used most often and what information is viewed.

### INFORMATION USE BY THIRD PARTIES

It is The Clymb policy to never provide your personal information to third parties without your express permission or only in instances where such disclosure is necessary to process payment transactions or provide services you have requested. We do not release personal information about you as an individual. We do reserve the right to release personal information in the event that we are required to comply with the demands of an appropriately empowered governmental authority, or in any instance that we, in good faith, believe it to be necessary to protect our rights, the rights of others, to protect our security, or that of others or to protect the safety of any persons. The Clymb will not sell, rent, loan or allow external access to a customer's contact lists.

### CREDIT CARD INFORMATION

The Clymb allows you to purchase merchandise in a variety of ways. When credit card billing is chosen, information is transferred to The Clymb's Clearing House Partner using industry-leading, secure transmission technology including SSL and HTTPS (the transmission standard used for transactions by major financial institutions). The information is then encrypted using Data Encryption and stored securely so that it is ready to handle your transactions. This information is only accessible to employees whose jobs necessitate it.
