# LevelUp .: Privacy Policy

## 1\. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains to Users of the LevelUp website ([https://www.thelevelup.com/](https://web.archive.org/)), mobile applications offered by or powered by LevelUp, microsites, software and service (collectively, the "Service"), how SCVNGR, Inc., doing business as LevelUp ("LevelUp", "we" or "us"), gathers and uses information collected in connection with use of the Service and the LevelUp platform. LevelUp takes reasonable steps to protect User privacy consistent with the guidelines set forth in this Privacy Policy and with all applicable laws. In this Privacy Policy, "User" or "you" means any person using the Service, whether by browsing the LevelUp website or using LevelUp mobile apps, paying for items and/or transactions using the LevelUp application, engaging in loyalty and rewards programs ("Programs") offered by LevelUp merchants (each a "Merchant"), or participating in any other activities available through the Service. 

BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE AND/OR THE LEVELUP PLATFORM, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND OUR USER TERMS OF SERVICE ([https://www.thelevelup.com/terms](https://web.archive.org/terms)). IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE SERVICE. 

## 2\. First Up, We Want You to Know This:

You control your personal information on the LevelUp platform. We will never disclose your email address, transaction history, or other information to any Merchant or any other third party for their marketing purposes without you first authorizing that Merchant or third party to access such information. This allows you to use the LevelUp Service and LevelUp platform without receiving a whole lot of direct marketing you don't want. 

## 3\. What Information Do We Collect?

Personal Information: LevelUp collects some of your identifying information in connection with the Service. When you create a LevelUp User Account (whether through a LevelUp App or LevelUp website), pay with LevelUp, engage in a Program, submit content to LevelUp, complete a survey, send us feedback, request information about the Service, apply for a job, or sign up for special offers from third parties, LevelUp may collect information from you, such as your email address, first and last name, mailing address, telephone number, date of birth, location, merchant transaction data (including the amount, date, and location of the transaction, the amount of credit earned and redeemed, and the identity and amount of items purchased), and some information related to your payment instruments, such as expiration date and authentication codes or related information (collectively, "Personal Information"). You do not have to provide Personal Information to LevelUp, but you may not be able to take advantage of all features of the Service if you do not. 

Financial Information. In order to use the Service and the LevelUp platform in connection with payments to merchants, you will need to link a payment instrument to your LevelUp User Account ("Financial Information"). LevelUp will only collect this information using a secure, transparent pass through to our third-party data vault and payment gateway provider, and LevelUp will never store your payment information itself. LevelUp and its providers maintain compliance with all laws and rules protecting the privacy of your financial information, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). 

Web Tracking Information. LevelUp and its third party service providers may use web tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and clear GIFs, to collect data related to usage of the Service, the Programs, and web and email marketing conducted by or on behalf of LevelUp. Such data may include the address of the websites you visited before and after you visited the Service, the type of browser you are using, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, what pages in the Service you visit and what links you clicked on. In order to collect Web Tracking Information and to make your use of the Service more efficient, we may store cookies on your computer. LevelUp and third party contractors engaged to provide services on behalf of LevelUp ("Contractors") may also use web tracking technologies that are placed in web pages on the Service or in email communications to collect information about actions that users take when they interact with the Service or such email communications. Web Tracking Information is not correlated by LevelUp to individual users. Some Web Tracking Information may include data, such as IP address data, that is unique to you. You may be able to modify your browser settings to alter which web tracking technologies are permitted when you use the Service, but this may affect the performance of the Service. 

## USA Patriot Act Notice to Merchants

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who registers for a Merchant Account with LevelUp. Merchants will be required to provide such information to the satisfaction of LevelUp prior to establishing a Merchant Account. 

## How Does LevelUp Use the Information We Collect?

Personal Information: LevelUp and its third party service providers may use web tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and clear GIFs, to collect data related to usage of the Service, the Programs, and web and email marketing conducted by or on behalf of LevelUp. Such data may include the address of the websites you visited before and after you visited the Service, the type of browser you are using, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, what pages in the Service you visit and what links you clicked on. In order to collect Web Tracking Information and to make your use of the Service more efficient, we may store cookies on your computer. LevelUp and third party contractors engaged to provide services on behalf of LevelUp ("Contractors") may also use web tracking technologies that are placed in web pages on the Service or in email communications to collect information about actions that users take when they interact with the Service or such email communications. Web Tracking Information is not correlated by LevelUp to individual users. Some Web Tracking Information may include data, such as IP address data, that is unique to you. You may be able to modify your browser settings to alter which web tracking technologies are permitted when you use the Service, but this may affect the performance of the Service. 

Financial Information: We will only ever use your Financial Information for the purpose of submitting an authorized charge to your payment instrument. Financial Information is never provided to LevelUp, and is never disclosed to third parties, including LevelUp Merchants, other than LevelUp's vault and payment gateway provider. 

Aggregate Information: LevelUp may also use Personal Information to create aggregated data for analytical purposes. This statistical information does not contain any individual identifying information or contact information and is used to understand our customer base as a whole and to better serve our market. LevelUp reserves the right to share such aggregated data with 3rd parties. 

Web Tracking Information: LevelUp uses Web Tracking Information to administer the Service and to understand how well our Service is working, and to develop aggregate, statistical information on usage of the Services. This allows us to determine which features visitors like best to help us improve our Service, personalize your user experience, and measure overall effectiveness. 

Email Communications: If you create a LevelUp User Account and provide your email address, we will send you administrative and promotional emails concerning the LevelUp Service and LevelUp platform, including new features, promotions, Programs, and rewards. If you wish to opt out of promotional emails, you may do so by following the "unsubscribe" instructions in the email, or by editing your LevelUp User Account settings as described below. All LevelUp Users receive administrative emails. If you wish to opt out of administrative emails, you must delete your account entirely and cease use of the Service. 

## What Information Do We Disclose to Third Parties?

Personal Information: LevelUp does not sell or rent its mailing list, and we will not disclose your email address to any third party for marketing purposes, unless you specifically authorize a third party (such as a LevelUp Merchant) to access that information. LevelUp will disclose your Personal Information to third parties only in the following limited circumstances: 

  * When you use the LevelUp Service at a Merchant, LevelUp may disclose your name (first name and last initial, but not your email address) to the associated Merchant to aid in the utilization process and loyalty program tracking; 

  * LevelUp may allow our Contractors, who are performing marketing services, delivering goods, administering promotions, analyzing data and usage of the Service, processing credit card payments, operating the Service or providing support and maintenance services for the Service, or providing customer service, to access Personal Information. We require Contractors to use the Personal Information they access only in connection with the services they perform for us, and never for any marketing or other purposes. 

  * LevelUp may use Personal Information to investigate reports of fraud, and to correct any issues associated therewith; 

  * LevelUp will permit access to your Personal Information by a Merchant or third-party that you specifically authorize to access your information, either by granting a party's request for permissions in your LevelUp App, or by downloading and logging into a Merchant LevelUp App with your LevelUp credentials, which grants to the Merchant providing the LevelUp App permission to access your Personal Information, including the email address you use to log in, and your transaction history. You can revoke access permissions granted to any Merchant or other third-party at any time by logging in to the LevelUp website at: [https://www.thelevelup.com/login](https://web.archive.org/login); and, 

  * If you are a winner of a Merchant or LevelUp sponsored competition (as detailed in the Applicable Contest Terms), we will share your contact information for purposes of prize fulfillment only. 




Web Tracking Information: LevelUp may disclose Web Tracking Information without individual identifying information, to third party advertisers and advertising agencies, Merchants, and Contractors, in order for LevelUp and such third parties to analyze the performance of the Services and the behavior of users, to operate and improve the Service. We may also publish selected aggregated information in order to promote the Service. 

Aggregate Information: We may disclose anonymous, aggregated information to third parties such as potential business partners, Merchants, advertisers, and funding sources, in order to describe our business and operations. 

Network Operators: Use of the Service may involve use of the services of third party telecommunications carriers and service providers (such as the services of the carrier that provides cellphone service to you). Such carriers and service providers are not LevelUp's Contractors, and any information that a carrier collects in connection with your use of the Service is not Personal Information and is not subject to this Privacy Policy. LevelUp is not responsible for the acts or omissions of telecommunications carriers or service providers. 

Additional Disclosures: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, LevelUp reserves the right to use or disclose Personal Information and any other information LevelUp collects in connection with the Service: (a) to any successor to LevelUp's business, including as a result of any merger, acquisition, asset sale or similar transaction; (b) to any law enforcement, judicial authority, or governmental or regulatory authority, to the extent required by law or legal process; or (c) if in LevelUp's reasonable discretion, such use or disclosure is necessary to enforce or protect LevelUp's legal rights or to protect third parties.

## Third-Party Apps

Please remember that once you grant a third party or Merchant permission to access your personal information in the LevelUp platform, or you use a link to go from a LevelUp App or website to another website, LevelUp's Privacy Policy no longer applies, and you will then be subject to that Merchant's or that website's own rules and policies. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction with any of these third parties or granting permissions for any LevelUp App to access any of your Personal Information. LevelUp is not responsible for any claims, liabilities, losses, or damages suffered by you in connection with your use of a third party LevelUp App, site, or service, in connection with the LevelUp platform.
