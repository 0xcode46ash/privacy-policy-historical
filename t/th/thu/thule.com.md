# Thule - Legal and Privacy Policy

Thule takes user privacy seriously; we believe people should be able to contact us without fear of being tracked or overloaded with SPAM. Because we understand how important it is that you know what will happen to any personal information you give us, our mission is to adhere to policies that prevent unauthorized use of your personal information, to maintain the accuracy of the information provided, and to protect the privacy of your information. We have created this policy to explain how we collect data on our website, and to educate users about what we do with this data. Our goal is to create the world’s best website for the world’s best rack system – and allow people to get information, browse and have fun on our site.

**What information does THULE collect and how is it used?**

E-mail Request for Information - We use links throughout our site so that you can contact us via e-mail to ask questions, request information and materials or send comments and suggestions. We may also ask to have one of our representatives contact you personally to provide additional information about our products or services. In this case, we may request additional personal information from you, such as your name and telephone number, to help us satisfy your request.

Enrollment - If you choose to signup for our e-newsletter and special offers, we will request certain information from you. You may be asked to provide personal details, such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or credit card number. Other promotions may require different or supplemental information from you in order to apply.

In addition to the information we get directly from you, we also gather information such as general usage of our website, viewing and traffic patterns, customer behaviour and other similar information that is not specific to any one person. We use this compiled information solely for the improvement of our website, our product and service offerings, our operations, and our customer service.

**Does THULE disclose the information it collects to outside parties?**

No! THULE does not resell any confidential customer information that is obtained or derived in its marketing efforts. However, we must cooperate fully should a situation arise where we are required by law or legal process to provide information about a customer.

**Why do you need my e-mail address?**

We may contact you by e-mail to confirm enrolment, check the accuracy of supplied information or send you notices about special offers, new products, services, promotions and other similar information. If you don’t want to receive e-mails from us, please advise us by e-mail. We will respect your wishes regarding the methods we use to communicate with you.

**What are cookies?**

"Cookies" are helpful pieces of information about you that a website stores on your hard disk to make your return visits to the website more convenient. For example, THULE uses cookies to help identify you so that you can access your member benefits quickly and easily. We do not use cookies to collect personal information or to retrieve information from your computer for purposes that are unrelated to the website or your interaction with the website.

**How does THULE protect customer information?**

Our website is designed to protect your personal information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks you to enter sensitive information, such as a credit card number, that information is encrypted and protected with advanced encryption software known as “SSL”. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just “surfing”.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we take additional steps to protect your personal information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.

**Do these same policies apply to non-THULE websites that I access through THULE?**

We cannot be responsible for the privacy and security practices of non-THULE websites. You will notice that our websites may contain links to other sites such as our benefit providers. While we believe these sites share a similar commitment to consumer privacy and security, you should review that site’s privacy and security policies when linking to their site.

**How does THULE update its Privacy and Security Policy?**

Any changes to our Privacy and Security Policy will be posted on this page so that you always know what information we collect and how we use it and the latest updates on how we maintain the secure portions of our websites. By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of information as it is disclosed in this Privacy and Security Policy Statement.
