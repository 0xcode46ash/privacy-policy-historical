If you do not wish to receive such information, write to thinkSPAIN.com, Thomas Alva Edison 7, 46980 Paterna, Valencia, Spain or send an e-mail to [unsubscribe@thinkspain.com](mailto:unsubscribe@thinkspain.com), specifying the e-mail address where you no longer wish to receive such information.

TWC will not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others unless you have given us your permission or as required by law or legal process.

TWC may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to our clients, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.

Should we elect to change our privacy policy we will post the changes here.

TWC reserves the right to remove your details and/or not provide requested information without explanation.
