# Privacy, Security, & eCommerce Policies – This is True

“My policy is simply to treat my customers the way I wish to be treated.”  
— _This is True_ Founder Randy Cassingham

### First Things First: Your Privacy

We not only **_will not_** provide your email address to _any_ advertiser, we actually work rather hard to keep it secret. Your address will _not_ be provided to anyone who is not an employee of _This is True_ unless we have your permission or are required to do so by law.

We further protect your privacy and email security in general by requiring that new subscribers “confirm” or “verify” their subscription request. This prevents people from harassing others by subscribing them to something they may not want. When you subscribe, we send a message asking you to confirm your subscription. You _must_ click the link in this message before your subscription will be activated. Of course, you may always cancel (or “unsubscribe”) at any time: there is a link at the bottom of _every issue_ to make it easy ([details](https://thisistrue.com/change/)).

 **In addition,** since our company’s formation in 1983, it has also been our policy to never sell customer _postal_ addresses, either. So if you buy our [Premium subscriptions](https://thisistrue.com/upgrade/), our [book collections](https://thisistrue.com/books/), or any other item, the information you provide us to deliver them is _also_ kept confidential. We miss out on profit opportunities by not selling our customer addresses, but that’s how _we_ want to be treated by the companies we do business with, so that’s how we treat our customers. Simple, eh?

 **Registration and Personal Information:**

 **Free subscribers:** We do not collect personal information unless you choose to subscribe to our mailings, in which case you must of course provide an email address for delivery of such mailings and, optionally, your name. To protect us, we keep a permanent record of such subscription requests. Once you “unsubscribe,” the subscription record we have access to on our provider’s site is deleted within a year, but if you prefer it to be deleted sooner, you can [contact us](https://thisistrue.com/contact/) with the request, which must specify the exact email address used.

 **Paying customers:** Registration on our Shopping Cart is optional unless you set up a “recurring” (automatic subscription renewal) option. If you prefer such an account be removed, contact us as above with your clear request. As required by tax authorities, we keep a permanent record of all purchases.

These policies apply to all customers, not just those covered by the GDPR.

 **Terms of Service:** _This is True_ ’s free edition is offered without charge for your personal use. In return for your free subscription, you agree to abide by the terms of the copyright notice included in each issue, _and_ you agree that you are responsible for maintaining your own subscription, including changing your own address or stopping your subscription when you choose. Unsubscribe links are included in every issue.

 **Comments and Letters to the Editor:** _All comments, whether sent by email or posted on this site, become the property of ThisIsTrue.Inc and may be published_. Comments will be published at our sole discretion. Once published, any editing of comments shall be at our sole discretion, including removing comments for any reason. Comments on the site will be removed in the case of spam, off-topic posts, “flaming,” invasion of others’ privacy or other legal reasons, or if they do not materially contribute to the discussion at hand. We ask that you include your first name and location, and these may be added by us if you fail to do so. Publication in our newsletters may include your first name and location, but will _not_ include your email address, and may (or may not) be edited for length or clarity.

 **Underage Subscribers:** _This is True_ is designed for adults and well-educated, older teens. Kids under 13 will not likely get the humor or irony, and we do not knowingly accept subscriptions for pre-teens. Any pre-teens discovered on our distribution will be deleted. Any particularly brainy kids that want to read _True_ should ask a parent to subscribe, and then ask to read their parent’s copy.

 **Cookies:**  Our sites — and the advertisers who make the free services possible — may use cookies or “web beacons” to get statistics on who sees what ads, whether you click on the ads, etc. We also use cookies to (for instance) stop showing you “hovering” subscription forms when you dismiss them. We have no way to personally identify any specific person from these cookies.

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of specific interest to you.

Google may be one of these third-party vendors, and they use cookies to serve ads here. Google uses a special [DART cookie](http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx) that enables it to serve ads to you based upon your visit to this site and others that you visit.

If you don’t want to have this DART cookie on your computer, you can [opt out](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). We feel you’ll be making a mistake by doing that, as you’ll then see ads for random goods or services that won’t be of much use to you.

### eCommerce Policies

 **Order Entry Security:** ThisIsTrue.inc uses industry-standard SSL security on our entire site, not just online order forms. Orders will show on your credit card statement or Paypal history as “This is True” (or “THISISTRUE.COM”).

 **Refund Policy:** All actual products (such as printed materials) have a 30-day return policy if defective. If you find a problem with a product, explain the problem via our [Contact Form](https://thisistrue.com/contact/) on this site. We do not offer refunds if you simply change your mind, or get mad when we tell the truth about an event.

 **Note Regarding Online Credit Card Security:** All credit card data entered by customers, including account numbers, are processed immediately _and are not kept_ on file by us for _any_ length of time. We _cannot_ “look up your number” to process a renewal for you even if you give us permission. We are _quite_ serious about the security of your data, and use the best methods available to us. We simply use what _we_ expect from the online merchants we buy things from.

### Affiliate Relationships

You should assume that any links on this site, or in our emails, is to a site that has an affiliate relationship and/or another material connection to the providers of goods and services mentioned, and the owners of this site may be compensated when you purchase from such a provider. You should always perform due diligence before buying goods or services from anyone — via the Internet or offline.
