## General Policy

thinkbroadband is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy and to using technology to enhance your online security. The information that you provide us with, or that is gathered automatically helps us to monitor our service and provide you with the services that you have subscribed to or access on our site.

Yes we know that paragraph sounds so boilerplate, but we really believe in privacy and doing the right thing. We try to make sure we do things by that ethos wherever possible.

We do not share subscriber information with third parties without your prior consent other than in cases of investigating or reporting abuse.

We will only use the information that we collect about you lawfully and in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 (the “Act”).

## Posting personal information to public areas

Please bear in mind that any personal information that you submit through forums, comments on news articles, etc. are published on our site and may be collected by others. If you are unsure about how any information you submit is used, please e-mail [team@thinkbroadband.com](mailto:team@thinkbroadband.com) before submitting anything and we can clarify.

## Email

We may send e-mails to users who have registered with us, and we use this and other information you provide for demographic purposes. We do not give our user list out to other parties and we only e-mail registered users. We do not approve of unsolicited e-mail and do not believe e-mailing users against their wishes is respectable. To that end we keep all e-mails to a minimum, unless a regular update is specifically and explicitly requested by the user. You can remove yourself from all our lists automatically by following instructions at our [unsubscribe page](http://www.thinkbroadband.com/unsubscribe.html) (if you are having difficulty, [drop us an e-mail](mailto:team@thinkbroadband.com?Subject=Difficulty_Unsubscribing)). To cancel your forum account, please [contact us](mailto:team@thinkbroadband.com?Subject=Delete_Forum_Account) and we'll sort it out.

We request that any information you provide us is kept up-to-date so that if you fill in any of our surveys, we may contact you to gather more information.

## Registration

Our site allows (but does not require) you to register with us if you wish to use some extended features which you may find useful. This also gives members more credibility when communicating on the message boards. Registration only requires an e-mail address, but you may provide an additional address which can be shown to anyone viewing your posts. This ‘public’ e-mail address on forums is optional and your ‘private’ e-mail address is not shown to users other then thinkbroadband staff and volunteers.

## Cookies & IP Addresses

Virtually all websites use cookies which are small files stored on your computer when you visit a site. The data stored in them is used to enable features on a site, such as keeping you logged in, or remembering your preferences. Please visit our cookies page find out more information our [cookie policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20170915090030id_/cookies).

## Surveys

On occasion we may conduct online surveys. This is used to gauge our service, collect demographic information and other information that we may find useful. These surveys are optional. We may share non-personal, aggregated information with third parties.

## Security

The personal information which we hold will be held securely in accordance with our internal security policy and the law. While we strive to keep the information that you supply directly or indirectly secure please be aware that the Internet is not a fully secure medium.

We ask for the minimum amount of data to provide the services we offer, so for example we may ask for your postcode, but not your house/flat number, since for the services we offer, postcode-level information is adequate to give you information about broadband services in your area, and we do not wish to store unnecessary data.

## Competitions

From time to time we operate competitions and promotions. Participation in these is optional. Be sure to check individual competition rules for any conditions that may apply.

## Usage of Information

We may co-operate with any local or national government or law enforcement authorities at their request and provide any information we hold. We also reserve the right to provide such information to third parties on receipt of appropriate documentation of their intention to issue legal proceedings against a user.

## Advertising

We use the services of a number of third party agencies including Google AdSense and affiliate marketing companies. When you view an advert, your browser will make a connection to such ad servers which may have their own policies; you can control settings through your browser and/or via advertising network opt-out page.

We do manually block advertisers who design ads to appear in a way that implies they are part of our website however we do not routinely approve individual adverts. If you see an advert that concerns you, please do not hesitate to [e-mail us](mailto:team@thinkbroadband.com?Subject=Advertising_Concern) with a screenshot and a capture of the URL the ad links to. This maximises the chances we can block it. We also strongly advise you to contact us if you see malware or similar content served from our site (but do check you do not have viruses/trojans which may cause these too). We do recommend you have Anti-virus software (yes—even if you use a Mac!)

You can opt out of online behavioural advertising for many companies via [Your Choices Online](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices "Your Ad Choices Online") (note this affects advertising across many networks and not limited to our website, nor does it guarantee that all ad networks are listed).

You can opt out of Google Adsense personalisation [here](https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/) (this applies to all Adsense ads across the Internet)

You can opt out of Google Analytics using a browser add-on (available for Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Opera) and [using this site](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptou).
