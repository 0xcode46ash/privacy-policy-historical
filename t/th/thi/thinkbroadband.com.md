We may send e-mails to users who have registered with us, and we use this and other information you provide for demographic purposes. We do not give our user list out to other parties and we only e-mail registered users. We do not approve of unsolicited e-mail and do not believe e-mailing users against their wishes is respectable. To that end we keep all e-mails to a minimum, unless a regular update is specifically and explicitly requested by the user. You can remove yourself from all our lists automatically by following instructions at our [unsubscribe page](https://web.archive.org/unsubscribe.html).

This also gives members more credibility when communicating on the message boards. Registration only requires one e-mail address, but you may provide an additional address which can be shown to anyone viewing your posts. This ‘public’ e-mail address is optional and your ‘private’ e-mail address is not shown to users other then thinkbroadband staff and volunteers. 

## Cookies 

We use ‘cookies’ to track advertising information, web site usage, and for authentication on the message boards, in addition to allowing you to specify preferences which are stored.
