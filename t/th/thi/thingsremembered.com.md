**Privacy Policy**  
If you shop at thingsremembered.com, we do not and will not ever sell your name, address or email address information to outside parties. 

We pledge to keep your confidential information confidential! We will only use the personal information you supply at thingsremembered.com for the purposes of improving your experience on our website. Creating a thingsremembered.com account allows you to take advantage of the unique services that thingsremembered.com offers, including email newletters with exclusive offers, the ability to view your order history and track your orders, and the ability to keep a convenient address book for faster checkout. 

Please note that if you have shopped exclusively at our store locations, we do make your information available to other companies that we believe offer products or services that might be of interest to you. If you have shopped at a Things Remembered store (not online) and do not wish to have your information shared, simply call Customer Service at 866.902.4438. 

**Security of Your Information**  
Rest assured that we utilize the latest encryption technology to ensure the safety of your personal information at Things Remembered. Your ordering information (name, address, credit card, etc.) is encrypted during the ordering process & transmission, using our secure server to provide the highest level of security possible. In addition, once received, your credit card data is stored on a server that cannot be accessed via the Internet. 

We further protect your information using the following methods:

  * **Password protection:** When you create an account with us, your password creates another level of security for your personal information. Your password is your secret code into your account. Make your password a combination of at least 6 (no more than 10) characters/numbers that are not easily guessed (don't make your password your last name, for example). 
  * **Site protection:** Our entire site is protected behind an advanced firewall (think of it as a cyber fortress), which prevents unauthorized persons from accessing your information.
