# Privacy and Security Policy - ThinkExist.com

At _ThinkExist.com_ , we value your privacy. We operate under a strict set of privacy principles:

The only information _ThinkExist.com_ obtains about individual visitors to its Web site is information supplied voluntarily by visitors. For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes the user’s domain name.

In cases when _ThinkExist.com_ may need personal information to provide visitors with services tailored especially for them, or to inform them about new features or services, visitors are asked explicitly for that information.

All identifiable information provided by members (name, email…) will not be disclosed to anyone unless members specifically request _ThinkExist.com_ to do so.

Only statistical information of our members as a group (usage habits, demographics) may be shared with any partner of _ThinkExist.com_ ; no identifiable information will be shared at any time. 

_ThinkExist.com_ employs appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of personal information

**Delete/Deactivate Policy  
** Users may unsubscribe to any of our electronic newsletters at any time by following the instructions contained at the end of every newsletter. 

**Newsletter Privacy Policy**  
_ThinkExist.com_ maintains a strict "NO-SPAM" policy. Your information, including your e-mail address will not be given to any third party if you sign up for one of our newsletters.

**Polling**  
_ThinkExist.com_ offers interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what the ThinkExist.com audience thinks about important issues. ThinkExist.com uses a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users. 

**Surveys**  
Occasionally, _ThinkExist.com_ conducts user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our advertisers and partners. We never share any information about specific individuals with any third party. 

**Tracking .Gif’s**  
_ThinkExist.com_ and its advertisers may use tracking or single-pixel gif images to count Web page accesses and gather some general statistical information. _ThinkExist.com_ does not gather personal information through the use of these images. Some advertisers may use tracking gifs that can track personal information from cookies that may have been previously placed on a user's computer.

**Consent**  
By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of information by _ThinkExist.com_ as specified above. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. 

For additional detail regarding _ThinkExist.com_ site submission guidelines, please visit our FAQ page.

**How to Reach Us**  
If you feel that this site is not following its stated information policy please notify us by e-mail to
