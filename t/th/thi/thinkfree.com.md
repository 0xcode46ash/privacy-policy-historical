# About Us Privacy Policy

**PRIVACY STATEMENT FOR ThinkFreeâ„¢**

ThinkFree is firmly committed to take all reasonably appropriate steps to secure the information you provide us. To demonstrate our commitment to privacy, we wish to inform you of our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website, and the security systems that we have put into place to reduce the risk of security breach. 

ThinkFree Uses State-of-the-Art Security Systems to Reduce the Risk of Security Breaches. 

This site has state-of-the-art security measures in place to reduce the risk of loss, misuse and alteration of the files and applications ("Files") under our control. Your personal File, and all information we learn about as described below, are kept in a system that is within a private network not accessible from the internet. 

ThinkFree continually reevaluates and reassesses its security systems. Nonetheless, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will never be breached. Because your continued trust is key, we will continue to evaluate and enhance our security measures. 

We Restrict The Release Of Contact Information. 

We need certain information about you, as set out in our site's registration form, to give us contact information (like your name and email address) and demographic information (like your zip code or age). We use this customer contact information to contact you when necessary. 

We also use customer contact information from the registration form to send you promotional material from time to time from some of our third-party business alliance associates ("Associates"). We exclusively use the services of NetCreations, , to market and administer these matters. NetCreations is bound by all the terms of this Privacy Statement. We will never distribute your email address or other personal contact information to anyone other than NetCreations. NetCreations has committed to us that they will only use this information to administer mailings to you and will not distribute your email address or personal contact information to any other company or individual at any time. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings through NetCreations when completing the registration form or at any other time (see the "choice/opt-out" section below). 

We Only Share Demographic Information About You on an Aggregated Basis. 

We also collect demographic and profile data about you. For example, our on-line surveys ask you for contact information such as email addresses and demographic information such as your zip code, age or income level. All this information is compiled to allow us to create aggregated demographic profiles which are shared with our advertisers. This information is not personal to you - you cannot be personally identified or contacted. 

We also use this data to send you information about our company. You may opt-out of receiving such correspondence from us by referring to the "choice/opt-out" section below. 

We Never Share Your Specific Financial Information. 

We may also ask for specific financial information about you (like account or credit card numbers) when you apply for fee-based services. Such financial information is only used to bill you for products and services that you may specifically request. This financial information is never shared with anyone outside ThinkFree. ****

**Children's Guidelines.**

Children primarily use our site in conjunction with educational activities. However, we collect on-line information as it is provided to us. We therefore may receive contact information from children and will not know whether or not the information is given with prior parental consent. We rely on parents to supervise and monitor their children's use of our site. ****

**Choice/Opt-Out/Correct.**

All communications -- from us or from any of our Associates or advertisers - are only sent through NetCreations. 

We provide you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications at the point where we request information about you. Our site also gives you the option to no longer receive communications or to no longer receive our services. Finally, our site gives you the option for changing and modifying information previously provided.
