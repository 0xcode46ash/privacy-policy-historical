THINQ Learning Solutions, Inc. (THINQ) respects your right to privacy. For this reason, we believe that you, the THINQ customer, have the right to know how we collect and use information collected at our web site and how we use the information collected as part of a hosted deployment of our software.

This statement describes privacy practices that apply to the entire family of THINQ web sites, including www.THINQ.com and www.UK.THINQ.com.

Privacy Practices Regarding THINQ Web Sites

  
NOTICE

What we collect and how we use it

THINQ collects the contact information (shipping, billing, and e-mail addresses) and the financial information necessary to process online orders. Once you choose to provide us personally identifiable information (any information by which you can be identified), you can be assured that it will only be used to support your customer relationship with THINQ. Collected financial information is exclusively used to bill for products and services purchased through our web site, and to contact you when necessary to inform you of relevant information pertaining to online transactions that you have conducted with THINQ (i.e., location of training seminar, user name and password for an online course, etc.) 

In addition, THINQ gathers visitors' IP (Internet protocol) addresses to aid in administering our web site. Such addresses are used to anonymously identify individual purchasers and their shopping carts so as to gather broad, non-personally identifying demographic information.

THINQ's site registration form allows visitors to the site to provide us with additional contact information. This information is used to provide you with a more "personalized" experience. By opting-in during registration, you may elect to receive information about THINQ and/or promotional material from a selection of our partners in the form of emails or surface mail. Visitors to the site may opt-out of receiving these emails or mailings (see the "CHOICE" section below).

Contests and Promotions

From time to time, THINQ offers voluntary contents and promotions on our web site in which we request certain personal information from the user. This information is used to administer the contest, notify winners, and send information about THINQ. Site visitors may opt-out of receiving future emails or mailings regarding contents or promotions (see the "CHOICE" section below).

Cookies

Like most e-commerce sites, THINQ's web site is only accessible to browsers enabled to accept cookies. Internet cookies function as digital "visitor passes." Acceptance of cookies from THINQ does not result in a transfer of personal information. Rather, THINQ cookies are only used to assist in the electronic customization of the visitor's experience.   


CHOICE  
Opt-In/Opt-Out   
During registration, first-time visitors can indicate their preferences regarding whether or not they wish to be contacted by THINQ regarding additional courses and learning products which match their interests, or regarding THINQ contests and promotions.   


ONWARD TRANSFER  
THINQ may provide aggregate statistics about its customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-parties. These statistics will include no personal information. Therefore, there is no onward transfer to third-parties of personal information collected on any of THINQ's websites.  


ACCESS AND DATA INTEGRITY  
THINQ strives to maintain accurate records of your personally identifiable information by making every effort to provide you with online access to your registration data so that you may view, update or correct your information at the THINQ site where it was submitted. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access or enabling you to make corrections. To access your personally identifiable information, return to the web page where you originally registered as a user and access your "Learning Portfolio" by entering your e-mail address and password to gain access to your registration page. From here, you can modify any of the information previously entered.   


SECURITY  
THINQ is committed to ensuring the security of your information. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Our site and all our customers' information reside on our in-house server, behind our firewall. Online ordering is secure provided that your browser can support secure transactions (most browsers support this facility). You can determine when you are in a secure environment by locating the key (Netscape browsers) or lock (Microsoft browsers) symbol at the bottom of the browser page. When the key or lock is complete, the information provided by you is encrypted, restricting access by anyone else. If your browser does not support secure transactions, there is a chance that others may view any information that you send. You can check your browser's "help" button to learn more about secure transaction support.   


THINQ realizes that you may have concerns about giving out credit card information online and we take the security of your transactions very seriously. We utilize Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, the industry standard for transferring sensitive information over the Internet. When users enter their credit card information online, it is encrypted to restrict unauthorized access. We use CyberSource as our credit card processing agent. CyberSource employs a 150-point fraud screen process that uses artificial intelligence methods to help prevent unauthorized purchases from being made on your credit card.

Privacy Practices Regarding THINQ-Hosted Deployments of the TrainingServer Learning Management System

NOTICE

Overview

The TrainingServer Learning Management System (LMS) software is designed to deliver and manage internal enterprise-wide training for our customers. The LMS allows customers to assess employees' skills, analyze employees' needs, manage and schedule employees' training events, develop employees' job paths and integrate real-time human resources data from a human resources information system (HRIS). The system can also function as a lending library to track the usage of physical training products such as books, audiocassettes and videotapes. 

What we collect

In performing these functions, the specific data points or activities with respect to personal information about employees collected by and received from our customers and hosted by THINQ might include:  
· Employee identification data, which may include personal data such as U.S. Social Security Numbers, home address and date of birth  
· Level of compensation and bonus potential  
· Highest level of education obtained  
· Professional skills and "areas for growth"  
· Administration and management of training  
· Possible paths for future career growth which make good use of individual's skill

How we use it  
THINQ's role relative to this data is one of application service provider. In this role, THINQ manages and distributes its LMS software to customers across a wide area network from a central data center. Customers populate this software with information, which may include the types of personal information detailed above in the "What we collect" subjection.   


THINQ supports the businesses of its customers purely as a data host. The data transferred are on-line data. In its role as data host, the data may only be accessed by THINQ for the following purposes:   
· Off-line backups for recovery purposes which are stored on-site and archived off-site  


· Manual processing limited to using data in problem solving and movement of databases for normal operational upgrades, recoveries and other actions to assure integrity, security and operability of the servers as needed by THINQ and its customers.  


· The necessary technical and database support required to assure continuous operation of the servers. Manual handling is on a need to know basis by authorized operations staff, technical support persons, database administrators, network administrators, and security administrators and is only accessed for problem solving, backups and normal computer operations movement of data.  


CHOICE  
As detailed below in the "ONWARD TRANSFER" section, THINQ does not disclose the personal information it hosts to any third parties other than a third-party application service provider nor does THINQ access or use the data for any purpose other than performing offline backups for recovery purposes or for problem solving, backups and normal computer operations movement of data.   


ONWARD TRANSFER  
THINQ may rely on third-party application service providers (ASP) to host the its customers' data. In such case, the role of the third-party ASP will be identical to THINQ's role as detailed above in the "NOTICE" section. THINQ will only do business with third-party ASPs who have adhered to the Safe Harbor principles. Besides such third-party ASPs, THINQ does not transfer any data on to any third party.   


ACCESS AND DATA INTEGRITY  
While THINQ may host personal data for a customer in the context of its application service provider relationship with that customer, THINQ adheres to a strict policy of not interfering with the data that it hosts in any way. Rather, the customer maintains all responsibility for the accuracy of the employee data that is ultimately hosted by THINQ. Thus only the customer holds responsibility for providing employees access to this information in order to verify its accuracy.   


SECURITY  
In its role of application service provider, THINQ takes all reasonable precautions to protect the data that it hosts on its servers from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alternation and destruction. Any and all manual handling is on a need to know basis by authorized operations staff, technical support persons, database administrators, network administrators, and security administrators and is only accessed for problem solving, backups and normal computer operations movement of data. Our site and all our customers' information reside on our in-house server, behind our firewall.  


In cases when THINQ relies on a third-party ASP to host its customers' data, THINQ works closely with this ASP to ensure that it has proper security mechanisms in place to ensure the security of the data.
