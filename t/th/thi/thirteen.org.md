# Privacy Policy | THIRTEEN - New York Public Media

_**(Updated 03/20/15)**_

## Thank You

for visiting the WNET Privacy Policy (the “Policy”).  This Policy and the WNET [Terms of Service](http://www.thirteen.org/about/terms-of-service/) governs the websites, online services, and mobile applications made available by WNET, including but not limited to WNET.org, WLIW.org, NJTVonline.org, thirteen.org, nyc-arts.org, THIRTEEN Explore, MetroFocus, and NYC-ARTS ** ** (collectively, the “WNET Sites”). WNET, THIRTEEN, WLIW, Public Media NJ, Creative News Group, and Interactive Engagement Group (collectively, “WNET”) are strongly committed to protecting the privacy of our online guests, members, donors, and friends. We believe that maintaining the highest standards of privacy online and on mobile devices is crucial to maintaining your trust in WNET. For this reason, we want to inform our visitors about the types of information we collect and how we use and store that information.

## 1\. Information We Collect

The WNET Sites collect only the information that is reasonably necessary for the activities available on the particular website or mobile application. For example, to participate in some activities, such as Sweepstakes that we may feature on a WNET Site, you may be asked to provide some personal identification information. If you do not want this information to be collected or used by us for these purposes, you can simply choose not to submit your information. However, this may prevent your participation in these activities. WNET will ask your permission before using your email address for WNET communications and will always give you a clear and convenient method of unsubscribing to our mailings.

 **a.    ****When You Make a Membership Pledge**  
We will ask you to provide the information necessary (name, billing and shipping address, telephone number, email address, and credit card number) to process and service your membership Pledge for THIRTEEN, WLIW, or NJTV. This information is encrypted for your security and is only seen by our membership staff who processes your gift and our contracted fulfillment agencies.

 **b.    ****When You Complete an Online Survey**  
WNET occasionally posts surveys on its sites. These surveys, which are completely voluntary, may ask about your interests, occupation, educational background, and so on. We use this information only to understand our members and viewers better and to determine how best to serve them. Specific information collected in surveys is not shared with third parties.

 **c.     ****Information Collected Automatically**  
Our server tracks how you and other visitors use the WNET Sites, identifying the source of visitors and what pages they use. By looking at this “traffic” we can better understand our community, which allows us to improve our websites and mobile applications and to provide you with an optimal experience and better service.

## 2\. Use of Tracking Technologies

In order to provide optimal service and convenience we use tracking technologies, including “cookies.” A cookie is a temporary code placed in your computer by our server that facilitates communication and saves you time when you browse WNET Sites. Cookies are completely anonymous and help us serve you. When you make a pledge, this information keeps track of items you add to your pledge basket so you can continue to browse the WNET Sites until you are ready to check out. At no time does the cookie reveal your name, address, or telephone number (even if you have entered these in other areas of WNET Sites). You always have the ability to disengage the cookie software on your browser without limiting your ability to make a pledge securely.

## 3\. Information Collected From Kids

The WNET Sites consist of general audience websites and mobile applications not designated or intended for use by children under the age of 13. Nonetheless, WNET takes great pride in the responsible and quality content and services we provide for children. For this reason, WNET does not knowingly collect or store personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child (who is under 13) has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us. Upon request, we will delete such information from our files within a reasonable time.

In the event that your child completes an enrollment form on one of WNET’s Sites and WNET learns that your child is under the age of 13, we will seek your permission to retain such information. WNET, with your permission, would use your child’s name, address and email address to process your child’s membership pledge, fulfill a request for an email newsletter subscription or other informational activities.

WNET will not condition your child’s participation in any activity on the child’s disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in such an activity. You may, at any time, review and have deleted your child’s personally identifiable information and refuse to permit further collection or the use of such information by emailing [membership@WNET.org](mailto:membership@WNET.org) or calling our Membership department at (212) 560-2888.

## 4\. Security and Storage of Information

WNET stores your information using reasonable security precautions and for only as long as we think reasonably necessary. We make every effort to ensure that all of the transactions that occur on the WNET Sites are secure. Credit card numbers submitted via a WNET Site are encrypted using “Secure Socket Layer” (SSL) encryption, which is industry standard for information security and is used by more than 100,000 websites in more than fifty countries. Personal information that you submit with your pledge is also encrypted. However, no transmission of data is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties to unlawfully intercept transmissions. If you believe a third party has accessed your information, please contact us immediately. If you do not feel comfortable submitting your personal information online you can make your pledge by calling us at 1-800-468-9913.

## 5\. How WNET Uses the Information

In general, the information we collect may be used to respond to your requests, enable you to take advantage of WNET Site features and services, personalize your content and experience, measure analytics, and manage and improve the services available on the WNET Sites. WNET also uses your information to fulfill your Membership Pledge and keep you informed of upcoming WNET events and programs. Our staff uses your credit card information to process your pledge and our fulfillment agencies use your name and address to mail your gift. When you enroll in sweepstakes featured on any WNET Site, independent sweepstakes judges use your information for the sole purposes of selecting and notifying winners.

## 6\. Information WNET Shares With Third Parties

Occasionally, WNET may share some of the information you provide when you register or make a membership pledge online with other carefully selected organizations. In no event will WNET sell, license, lease, lend, trade, donate, transfer, exchange or otherwise disclose the station’s membership lists with, or acquire such lists from, any candidate for public office, committees or organizations supporting a candidate, political parties, or organizations that solicit funds for use in political campaigns. If you would prefer not to have your information shared with third parties, contact us by emailing [membership@WNET.org](mailto:membership@WNET.org) or calling our Membership department at (212) 560-2888.

## 7\. Your Control over Your Information

You may choose and control what information you provide about yourself and certain information which is automatically collected by the WNET Sites. You have the right to update and correct any personally identifiable information we collect about you. You also have the right to opt-out of future communications from WNET or request that WNET remove your information or cease tracking your individual activity, either online or via mobile devices. You can accomplish this by emailing [membership@WNET.org](mailto:membership@WNET.org), calling our Membership department at (212) 560-2888, or changing the settings on your mobile application. If you do not want any information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows a user to accept or reject most cookies.

## 8\. Acceptance of This Policy

By using the WNET Sites, you expressly consent to our collection, use, disclosure, and retention of your information, and any other terms and conditions of this Policy. This Policy refers solely to the WNET Sites and does not cover websites that are linked from a WNET Site, such as PBS websites and other corporate funders. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Policy at any time. Your continued use of the WNET Sites following the posting of any changes to this Policy shall signify an acceptance of those changes. Please check this page periodically for updates.

## 9\. Changes to This Policy

Whenever this Policy changes, we will post the changes to the WNET Sites, and those changes will be effective immediately upon posting. If you do not agree to the changes, please do not continue to use the WNET Site. Under certain circumstances, we may also elect to notify you of changes to this Policy by additional means, such as posting a notice on a WNET Site or sending you an e-mail if we have your e-mail address.

## 10\. Contact Us

We try to read and respond promptly to every inquiry that we receive. If you email or call WNET, we will make sure your question or comment reaches the appropriate person. Please feel free to contact us with any questions, including with regard to this Policy, WNET’s online practices, or your WNET Membership account. You can reach us by phone at (212) 560-2888, by email at [membership@WNET.org](mailto:membership@WNET.org), or by mail at WNET, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, NY 10019.
