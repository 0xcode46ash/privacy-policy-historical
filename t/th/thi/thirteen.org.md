# Privacy Policy | THIRTEEN - New York Public Media

_**(Updated December 15, 2015)**_

 **Thank you for visiting the WNET Privacy Policy (the “Policy”). We believe that maintaining the highest standards of privacy online and on mobile devices is crucial to maintaining your trust in WNET. For this reason, we want to inform our visitors about the types of information we collect and how we use and store that information.**

## 1\. Sites Covered by this Policy

This Policy and the WNET [Terms of Service](http://www.thirteen.org/about/terms-of-service/) govern the websites, online services, and mobile applications made available by WNET, including but not limited to WNET.org, WLIW.org, NJTVonline.org, thirteen.org, and nyc-arts.org, and the THIRTEEN Explore, MetroFocus, and NYC-ARTS applications (collectively, the “WNET Sites”). WNET, THIRTEEN Productions LLC, WLIW LLC, Public Media NJ Inc., Creative News Group LLC, and Interactive Engagement Group LLC (collectively, “WNET”) are strongly committed to protecting the privacy of our online visitors, members, donors, and friends.

Please note that the WNET Sites often link to third party sites or services, including social media and sites or services owned or controlled by PBS and other public media entities. This Privacy Policy does not cover any third party sites or services, or use thereof, and we suggest that you review those sites’ policies to learn more about their privacy practices.

## 2\. Information We Collect

The WNET Sites collect only information that is reasonably necessary to facilitate and optimize the WNET Sites and the activities available on them.

 **A. Information You Provide to Us (Personally Identifiable Information)**  
You may be asked to provide some personally identification information to participate in some activities on the WNET Sites. If you do not want this information to be collected or used by us for these purposes, you can simply choose not to submit your information. However, this may prevent your participation in these activities. Some of the purposes for which WNET may request personally identifiable information include:

 **a. Making a Membership Pledge**  
We will ask you to provide the information necessary (name, billing and shipping address, telephone number, email address, and credit card number) to process and service your membership pledge for THIRTEEN, WLIW, or NJTV. This information is encrypted for your security and is only seen by the membership staff processing your gift and by our contracted fulfillment agencies.

 **b.  Completing an Online Survey**  
WNET occasionally posts surveys on its sites. These surveys, which are completely voluntary, may ask about your interests, occupation, educational background, and so on. We use this voluntarily provided information to understand our members and viewers better and to determine how best to serve them, and we store survey answers separately from email addresses and other personally identifiable information. Personally identification information collected in surveys is not shared with third parties.

 **c.  Entering a Promotion**  
WNET may offer you the opportunity to enter sweepstakes, contests, or other promotions on the WNET Sites or through social media pages owned or controlled by WNET. You may be required to provide your name and email address at the time of entry, and WNET may also request additional contact information (e.g., your street address or phone number) so that we may contact you in connection with the promotion. Please see each promotion’s individual rules or terms for further information.

 **B. Information We Collect Automatically (Aggregate and Other Non-Personally Identifiable Information)**  
Our server tracks how you and other visitors use the WNET Sites, identifying the source of visitors and what pages they use. By looking at this “traffic” we can better understand our community, which allows us to improve our websites and mobile applications and to provide you with an optimal experience and better service.

 **a. Cookies and Tracking Technologies**  
In order to provide optimal service and convenience we may use tracking technologies, including “cookies.” Cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixels and other tags) are temporary bits of code placed in your web browser that allows WNET to track how you use the WNET Sites and facilitates communication when you browse WNET Sites. Cookies are completely anonymous and help us serve you: we use information gathered with cookies to optimize the WNET Sites and your browsing experience. We also use cookies when you make a pledge to keep track of items you add to your pledge basket so you can continue to browse the WNET Sites until you are ready to check out. At no time does the cookie reveal your name, address, email, or telephone number (even if you have entered these in other areas of WNET Sites). You always have the ability to set your browser to refuse to accept cookies without limiting your ability to make a pledge securely or browse the WNET Sites – though some parts of the WNET Sites may not function properly if cookie acceptance is disabled.

 **b. Third Party Tracking**  
Third parties, including those advertising on our sites and our advertising analytics partners, may also use tracking technologies to follow your use of the WNET Sites or advertisements placed on the Sites. WNET does not control third party tracking, which occurs on our Sites by DoubleClick; you may opt out of DoubleClick tracking by visiting Google’s [DoubleClick opt-out page](http://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated#display_optout) and control your trackability more widely at the [Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).

## 3\. How We Use Your Information

WNET does not sell or rent personal information of members, donors, or website visitors under any circumstances, and we do not share member, donor or visitor information without prior consent except as compelled by law or provided in this Policy.

 **A. Personally Identifiable Information**  
Personally identifiable information will only be used for the purpose for which it was requested and provided. Our staff uses your credit card information to process your pledge and our fulfillment agencies use your name and address to mail your gift. When you enroll in sweepstakes featured on any WNET Site, independent sweepstakes judges use your information for the sole purposes of selecting and notifying winners. WNET may request permission, when you give us your email address, to add you to our email list; email recipients may opt out of this list at any time by clicking the “Unsubscribe” button at the bottom of our mailings.

 **B. Aggregate and Other Non-Personally Identifiable Information**  
In general, the information we collect automatically may be used to respond to your requests, enable you to take advantage of WNET Site features and services, personalize your content and experience, measure analytics, and manage and improve the services available on the WNET Sites.

## 4\. Information We Share With Third Parties

Occasionally, WNET may share some of the information you provide when you register or make a membership pledge online (name and postal address) with other carefully selected organizations. In no event will WNET sell, license, lease, lend, trade, donate, transfer, exchange or otherwise disclose the station’s membership lists with, or acquire such lists from, any candidate for public office, committees or organizations supporting a candidate, political parties, or organizations that solicit funds for use in political campaigns. If you would prefer not to have your information shared with third parties, contact us by emailing [membership@WNET.org](mailto:membership@wnet.org) or calling our Membership department at 212-560-2888.

## 5\. Information Collected From Kids

The WNET Sites consist of general audience websites and mobile applications not designated or intended for use by children under the age of 13. Nonetheless, WNET takes great pride in the responsible and quality content and services we provide for children. For this reason, WNET does not knowingly collect or store personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child (who is under 13) has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us. Upon request, we will delete such information from our files within a reasonable time.

In the event that your child completes an enrollment form on one of WNET’s Sites and WNET learns that your child is under the age of 13, we will promptly delete your child’s information.

WNET will not condition your child’s participation in any activity on the child’s disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in such an activity. You may, at any time, review and have deleted your child’s personally identifiable information and refuse to permit further collection or the use of such information by emailing [membership@WNET.org](mailto:membership@wnet.org).

## 6\. PBS Passport Service

If you are viewing on-demand video on the WNET Sites through the PBS Passport service or player, you have agreed that PBS may collect your viewing and usage information and that PBS may share this information with WNET. Your individual and usage viewing information will only be shared with WNET, but PBS may share aggregate de-identified viewing and usage information with its member stations and service providers, as well as WNET. PBS’s collection, storage, and use of Passport information is subject to [PBS’s Terms and Conditions](http://www.pbs.org/about/terms-conditions/).

## 7\. Security and Storage of Information

WNET stores your information using reasonable security precautions and for only as long as we think reasonably necessary. We make every effort to ensure that all of the transactions that occur on the WNET Sites are secure. Credit card numbers submitted via a WNET Site are encrypted using “Secure Socket Layer” (SSL) encryption, which is industry standard for information security and is used by more than 100,000 websites in more than fifty countries. Personal information that you submit with your pledge is also encrypted. However, no transmission of data is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties to unlawfully intercept transmissions. If you believe a third party has accessed your information, please contact us immediately. If you do not feel comfortable submitting your personal information online you can make your pledge by calling us at 800-468-9913.

## 8\. Your Control over Your Information

You may choose and control what information you provide about yourself and certain information which is automatically collected by the WNET Sites. You have the right to update and correct any personally identifiable information we collect about you. You also have the right to opt-out of future communications from WNET or request that WNET remove your information or cease tracking your individual activity, either online or via mobile devices. You can accomplish this by emailing [membership@WNET.org](mailto:membership@wnet.org), calling our Membership department at 212-560-2888, or changing the settings on your mobile application. If you do not want any information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows a user to accept or reject most cookies.

## 9\. Acceptance of This Policy

By using the WNET Sites, you expressly consent to our collection, use, disclosure, and retention of your information, and any other terms and conditions of this Policy. This Policy refers solely to the WNET Sites and does not cover websites that are linked from a WNET Site, such as PBS websites and other corporate funders. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Policy at any time. Your continued use of the WNET Sites following the posting of any changes to this Policy shall signify an acceptance of those changes. Please check this page periodically for updates.

## 10\. Changes to This Policy

Whenever this Policy changes, we will post the changes to the WNET Sites, and those changes will be effective immediately upon posting. If you do not agree to the changes, please do not continue to use the WNET Site. Under certain circumstances, we may also elect to notify you of changes to this Policy by additional means, such as posting a notice on a WNET Site or sending you an e-mail if we have your e-mail address.

## 11\. Contact Us

We try to read and respond promptly to every inquiry that we receive. If you email or call WNET, we will make sure your question or comment reaches the appropriate person.
