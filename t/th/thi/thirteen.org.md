# Privacy Policy | THIRTEEN - New York Public Media

## Thank You

for visiting one of the WNET websites. As an extension of our broadcast mission we want your visit to WNET.org, thirteen.org, WLIW.org, nyc-arts.org, and NJTVonline.org (the “WNET Sites”) to enlighten, inform and entertain you. WNET, THIRTEEN, WLIW LLC, Public Media NJ, Inc., Creative News Group LLC, and Interactive Engagement Group LLC (here collectively “WNET”) are strongly committed to protecting the privacy of its online guests, members, donors, and friends. We believe that maintaining the highest standards of privacy on the Web is crucial to maintaining your trust in WNET. For this reason, we want to inform our visitors about the types of information we collect and how we use that information.

## Information You Give Us

To participate in some activities, such as any Sweepstakes that we feature on our site, you may be asked to provide some personal identification information. If you do not want this information to be collected or used by us for these purposes, you can simply choose not to submit your information. However, this may prevent your participation in these activities. WNET will ask your permission before using your email address for WNET communications and will always give you a clear and convenient method of unsubscribing to our mailings.

  1. ### When You Make a Membership Pledge

We will ask you to provide the information necessary to process and service your membership Pledge for THIRTEEN, WLIW, or NJTV: (name, billing and shipping address, telephone number, email address, and credit card number). This information is encrypted for your security and is only seen by our membership staff who processes your gift and our contracted fulfillment agencies.

  2. ### When You Complete an Online Survey

WNET occasionally posts surveys on its sites. These surveys, which are completely voluntary, may ask about your interests, occupation, educational background, and so on. We use this information only to understand our members and viewers better and to determine how best to serve them. Specific information collected in surveys is never shared with third parties.

  3. ### Information Collected Automatically

Our server tracks how you and other visitors use our sites, identifying the source of visitors to the WNET Sites and what pages they use on our site. By looking at this “traffic” we can better understand our community, which allows us to improve our web site and to provide you with an optimal experience and better service. 

In order to provide this optimal service and convenience we use “cookies.” A cookie is a temporary code placed in your computer by our server that facilitates communication and saves you time when you browse our web site. Cookies are completely anonymous and help us serve you. When you make a pledge, this information keeps track of items you add to your pledge basket so you can continue to browse our web site until you are ready to check out. At no time does the cookie reveal your name, address, or telephone number (even if you have entered these in other areas of WNET Sites). You always have the ability to disengage the cookie software on your browser without limiting your ability to make a pledge securely.

  4. ### Email

We regularly send email Program Guides to our registered members and visitors with information about WNET programs, services or membership opportunities. If you do not wish to receive any email from WNET, indicate your preference on the pledge form when making a pledge or send an email message with your name to [membership@WNET.org](mailto:membership@WNET.org). We will do our best to make your change in a timely manner.

  5. ### Mobile Number

THIRTEEN sends mobile text alerts to supporters who have given us their mobile telephone number and have opted-in to receive these text alerts. Text alerts provide information about programs, services, membership opportunities and other promotions. If you wish to receive text alerts to your mobile phone, text the word “THIRTEEN” to short code 30644. Message and data rates may apply. If you currently receive text alerts from THIRTEEN and wish to unsubscribe, text the word “STOP” to 30644, or send an email with your name, email address and mobile number to [membership@WNET.org](mailto:membership@WNET.org). We will do our best to make your change in a timely manner. For more information, text “HELP” to 30644.

WNET never sells, exchanges or lends to third parties any email or telephone or mobile information you provide when making a Membership Pledge or subscribing to our online Program Guide.




## Security

WNET makes every effort to ensure that all of the transactions that occur on its Web site are secure. All credit card numbers submitted to the site are encrypted using “Secure Socket Layer” (SSL) encryption, which is the industry standard for information security and is used by more than 100,000 Web sites in more than fifty countries. Any personal information you submit with your pledge is encrypted and completely secure. Even in the unlikely event that the information you send is intercepted it will not be usable by anyone else.

Your peace of mind and safeguarding is very important to us. If you do not feel comfortable submitting your personal information online you can make your pledge by calling us at 1-800-468-9913.

## How WNET Uses This Information

WNET uses the information you provide to fulfill your Membership Pledge (see When You Make a Membership Pledge) and to keep you informed of Station events and programs. Our staff uses your credit card information to process your pledge and our fulfillment agencies use your address information to mail you your gift. When you enroll in any sweepstakes featured on our site, independent sweepstakes judges use your information for the sole purposes of selecting and notifying winners.

Occasionally, WNET may share the information you provide when you register or make a membership pledge online (your name and your postal address) with other carefully selected organizations. In no event will WNET sell, rent, lease, lend, trade, give, donate, transfer, or otherwise exchange, the station’s membership lists with, or acquire such lists from, any candidate for public office, committees or organizations supporting a candidate, political parties, or organizations that solicit funds for use in political campaigns.

If you would prefer not to have your information shared in this way, contact us via email at [membership@WNET.org](mailto:membership@WNET.org) or at the postal address or telephone number listed below.

## Kids

WNET takes great pride in the responsible and quality content we provide for children. Your continued trust is even more important as kids gain more access to the internet. For this reason we will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from your child. We believe taking this precaution will help ensure the safety, value and enjoyment of your child’s visits to our web site. In the event that your child completes an enrollment form on one of WNET’s websites and WNET learns that your child is under the age of 13, we will seek to obtain your permission to retain such information by postal mail or telephone. WNET, with your permission, would use your child’s name, address and email address to process your child’s membership pledge, fulfill a request for an email newsletter subscription or other informational activities.

WNET may also share your child’s personally identifiable information for marketing purposes with other carefully selected non-profit and commercial organizations, who have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of the information they obtain from WNET. You may stipulate that your child’s name not be exchanged with other organizations by calling our Member and Viewer Relations department at (212) 560-2888.

WNET will not condition your child’s participation in any activity on the child’s disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in such an activity. You may, at any time, review and have deleted your child’s personally identifiable information and refuse to permit further collection or the use of such information by calling our Member and Viewer Relations department at (212) 560-2888.

## Accessing Information You have Submitted
