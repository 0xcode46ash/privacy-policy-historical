## Data Protection and Privacy

YOUR trust is our most important asset. You should be aware that this policy applies only to Associated New Media's ('Associated') websites and not to the other websites to which we provide links. If we ask for information about you, we take all possible steps to keep it safe. 

At Associated we are very serious about protecting your privacy. If we ask for information about you, we take all possible steps to keep it safe. 

We may use this information to tell you of changes to the site (and any changes to this policy will be posted here). 

We may also use the information to communicate with you and to let you know about products and services in which you may be interested, from Associated, from other Daily Mail and General Trust companies and from reputable and trustworthy third parties. This will be done only with your consent. 

With your consent, we may supply personal information to third parties. We may also provide them with overall statistics about customers and visitors to our site. The latter will not include information that could personally identify you. 

We reserve the right to access and to disclose personal information to comply with applicable laws and lawful Government requests, to operate our systems properly or to protect either ourselves or our users. 

In the event that you repeatedly contravene our Community Terms and Conditions or post during a suspension or ban, we reserve the right to contact your Internet Service Provider or employer. 

We guarantee this for all Associated websites - This is Travel, This is Money, UK Plus, This is London, Daily mail and Mail on Sunday. This may not be the case for other sites we link to. 

**What information do we need?**

**1.** To provide the services you want, we need to know your interests. We find out by asking you, by reading your comments and by looking at which are the most popular areas of the site. This may involve the use of cookies - small snippets of data stored on your computer by your web browser. Cookies help us deliver a more personal service when you visit us again. 

**2.** If you enter a contest or promotion we ask for your name, address and email address. This is so we can run the contest effectively and tell you if you have won. 

**3.** If you order a product or services from us, including subscribing to the Subscription Areas, we will need you to input your name, email address, delivery address, credit or **debit card** number and expiry date. Sometimes we may ask for your telephone number to be forwarded to the couriers who may deliver your order. These details allow us to process your orders efficiently. 

**4.** If you use our 'email a friend' service, we ask for the friend's name and email address. We then send an automatic, one-time email inviting your friend to visit us. Details of this transaction are stored only to send that one-time email or to track complaints of mischievous use. Your friend may email [privacy@anm.co.uk](mailto:privacy@anm.co.uk) to ask that it be deleted. 

**5.** We use some of the information collected about you to personalise your visits to our website so that the site appeals to your interests and offers goods or services that you may want. We can also use the information to help us develop the design and style of our website to improve our service to you. 

**6.** Occasionally, we will use your personal information to inform you about the latest changes to our website, and products or services that you might find interesting. 

**7.** We will send your our newsletter if you have signed up for it. You may unsubscribe at any time using the link provided at the bottom of the newsletter. 

**Correcting or updating your information**

Should your personal information change (e.g. your postcode), or if you no longer want services you have signed up for, email [privacy@anm.co.uk](mailto:privacy@anm.co.uk) requesting that we correct, update or remove the data you provided. 

**More about cookies**

A cookie is a piece of information that is stored on your computer's hard drive by your web browser. This allows you to experience a more personalised service when you revisit us. The cookie allows us to find out about your last visit. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but usually you can alter the settings of your browser to prevent automatic acceptance if you prefer. If you choose not to receive our cookies, we cannot guarantee that your experience with our website will be as quick or responsive as if you do receive cookies. 

**Your consent**

By using this website, you agree that we may collect and use information as described in this policy. We will always make clear how we do this, and allow you to tell us whether and to whom your information may be disclosed. 

To comply with British and European Union laws, we have to make clear that your details may be supplied to third parties, possibly outside the European Economic Area. 

Information may also be sent outside the European Economic Area for processing, either by ourselves or by other companies. 

By using this site you consent to both of the above types of transfer.
