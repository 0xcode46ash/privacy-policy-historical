**Privacy/Security**

**Information You Provide**

At ThinkJobs.com, we respect your privacy. Our job-seeker registration form requires users to submit contact information (such as their e-mail address) and to complete a candidate profile containing information about employment preferences and qualifications. Job seekers may also submit a resume. The user's contact and personal information is used to contact them when necessary, and to send automatic notifications of matching job opportunities or confidential "invitations" that may result when employers search the ThinkJobs.com database. When potential employers search our candidate database, they are not searching user resumes. Rather, they peruse profiles created by users. The profile created by the job seeker is designed to protect his/her privacy and does not contain any personally identifiable information UNLESS the candidate enters such information intentionally.E-mail addresses submitted to ThinkJobs.com will be used only for the purposes of the ThinkJobs.com career search service. As stated above, the release of a user's resume, contact information and e-mail are under the control of the user and will not be released unless so authorized by the user in one of the ways outlined above, or if the user specifically chooses to receive updates and special offers from ThinkJobs.com. User contact information is used only for delivering ThinkJobs.com services and are kept confidential. This information will never be sold or otherwise distributed to third parties for purposes other than those outlined above. We have taken measures to assure both the physical and electronic security of the data we store.

We store IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable.

Only employees who need the information to perform their job (for example, a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to that information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on ThinkJobs.com's security and privacy practices. Our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place upon privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected.Finally, the servers where we store personal information are kept in a protected environment, with multiple, redundant security features.If you have any questions about the security at ThinkJobs.com, please don't hesitate to contact us at: [support@ThinkJobs.com](mailto:Support@ThinkJobs.com).
