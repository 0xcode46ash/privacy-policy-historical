At ThinkJobs.com, we respect your privacy. Our job-seeker registration form requires users to submit contact information (such as their e-mail address) and to complete a candidate profile containing information about employment preferences and qualifications. Job seekers may also submit a resume.

User contact information is used only for delivering ThinkJobs.com services and are kept confidential. This information will never be sold or otherwise distributed to third parties for purposes other than those outlined above. We have taken measures to assure both the physical and electronic security of the data we store.
