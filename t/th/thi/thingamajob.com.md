This is gathered on an anonymous, aggregate basis about all of our users and is not identifiable to specific users.

## Use of Information

Except as described below, thingamajob.com does not voluntarily provide users' personal information to others.

Thingamajob generally shares users' personal information with its affiliates to facilitate the job search process. This sharing of information with affiliates may include combining the information gathered by Thingamajob with information separately gathered by these affiliates into one database useable by Thingamajob and all of its affiliates.

Thingamajob may disclose a user's personal information to a third party client, but only if the user has authorized Thingamajob to share the information.

Thingamajob may employ third party companies from time to time to perform certain functions on its behalf such as analyzing data, hosting web servers, or providing marketing services. These third party providers may have access to users' personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they are not permitted to share that information with any third party. Thingamajob also may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or to protect the rights and property of others.

As noted above, Thingamajob also gathers certain information on an aggregate and anonymous basis regarding users' visits to Thingamajob. This aggregate information may be shared by Thingamajob with third parties.

Thingamajob will not knowingly sell users' personal information to anyone.

Users should note that when voluntarily displaying personal information (for example, phone numbers or e-mail addresses) over the Internet, the information may be accessible by third parties. Thingamajob does not guarantee that third parties will not gain access to users' information transmitted over the Internet or to the thingamajob database, and we are not responsible for the use or privacy of data in these circumstances.
