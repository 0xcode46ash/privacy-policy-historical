We will only collect personal information about you, given by you, when you complete a contact form requesting us to contact you or an application form. Please note that for quality and training purposes, telephone calls to our offices will be recorded and monitored.

#### What happens to the information provided/collected?

We may use the information you provide to contact you, for product administration and for customer research. We will also use the information you provide to carry out an electronic check with a credit reference agency. This will not leave a record but will be used to verify the information you provided us. If you give false of inaccurate information and fraud is identified, details will be passed to fraud prevention agencies. The information you provide through this website may be used by Think Money Limited and its sister Think Money Group companies (All About Money Limited, Think Loans and Mortgages Limited, Think Insure Limited, Think Money Limited, Gregory Pennington Limited, Freeman Jones Limited, Wilson Andrews Limited, Ideal Finance Limited, Intelligent Lending Limited) to provide you with information, including by email and mobile telephone, about their and other companies' products and services that may be of interest to you.

If you submit a loan or mortgage application we may also make one or more credit searches for each applicant when making our recommendation and, the chosen lender may also search your record to verify your credit worthiness and identity. The credit reference agency will add details of any searches to your record which can be seen by other organisations that make searches and they may use it to help make credit decisions about you, to prevent fraud and money laundering and to trace debtors.

We may also use or disclose information to the extent required by law, court order, as requested by other government law enforcement authority, or to enforce legal rights.

We do not routinely transfer personal information outside the European Economic Area (EEA - which currently comprises of the Member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein).

By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
