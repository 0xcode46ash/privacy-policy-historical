### CONTACTIVE PRIVACY POLICY

Welcome to Contactive! This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices and procedures of Thinking Phone Networks, Inc. (d/b/a Contactive) (“Contactive”, “we”, “us” or “our”) in connection with our real time intelligence platform (the “Platform”) that enables our clients to maximize the productivity of their sales calls and related efforts (collectively, the “Services”), including use of the www.thinkingphones.com web site and its subdomains (the “Website”) and our related mobile application (the “Mobile App”). This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by or in connection with the Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Contactive does not administer, or to individuals that Contactive does not employ. We may update this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a new Privacy Policy to our Website or by delivery of notice through our Mobile App. Your access and use of the Services is subject to this Privacy Policy and to our separate terms of use on the Website or App as in effect from time to time (“Terms of Service”). Your use of the Services is also subject to any agreement (“Client Agreement”) between Contactive and the organization that employs or otherwise retains you to engage in sales efforts using our Platform (the “Client”). With respect to any and all information you provide to us which is owned by the Client, all of Contactive’s rights to use such information is set forth solely in the Client Agreement and is not subject to this Privacy Policy.

#### Notice of Information We Collect And How We Use It

Our primary purpose in collecting Personal Information (as defined below) is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience using our Services. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our Services to improve your experience. “Personal Information” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, or e-mail address, etc.) or other information about such individual that is directly linked to Personal Information. Personal Information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of our Services or that is extracted from Personal Information in a manner that does not identify an individual. We collect and store information, including Personal Information, that you provide to us when registering or when using the Services. Some Personal Information is required in order for you to register as a user of our Services. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but by doing so, you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features and functionality. We use Personal Information to deliver the Services to you, to improve the delivery of our Services, which may include advertising, and to develop analytics and aggregated data that allow us and our partners (including the Client) to improve our Services and correspond with you.

We also collect and store non-personally identifiable information that is automatically generated when you use the Services. We use this information to do internal research on the nature of our users to better understand, protect and serve you and our clients generally.

In general, our collection and use of information is as follows:

  * Contactive collects Personal Information you knowingly choose to submit to us during registration, such as your name, and email address, which we use for the following general purposes: identification and authentication of a user, provision of and improvement to the Platform and Services, contact, research, reporting of aggregated, anonymous data and correspondence with you regarding our Services or other products or services (the “General Purposes”).
  * Contactive automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookies, and the pages you request. IP addresses are automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web page. Your IP address is stored by Contactive when you register with Contactive. IP addresses may be used for various research purposes, the General Purposes and/or delivering unique functionality to our service.
  * We may allow users to post content on the Services. If we make such a feature available, you post content at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you choose to share your information. Even after removal, copies of such content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your content.



##### Cookies

By using our Services, you indicate your consent for Contactive and our affiliates to send cookies to your computer in order to uniquely identify your browser or device and improve the quality of our Services; you may turn off cookies in your browser though, in doing so, some of our Services may not work. A “cookie” is a piece of alphanumeric data stored on a visitor’s hard drive that enables us to improve your access to our Services and identify repeat visitors to our Services. We use the non-personally identifiable information, such as your browser version, IP address, referring domains, pages visited, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, the nature of your use of the Services and cookie information, to improve our Services delivery, including advertising, for the General Purposes, and to develop analytics and aggregated data that allow us and our partners to utilize our Service and reach out to you via our Services or otherwise. If you wish to restrict or block the cookies which are set by Contactive, or by any other website, you can do this through your browser settings. The Help function within your browser should tell you how to do so. For information on how to delete cookies on the browser of your mobile phone as applicable you will need to refer to your handset manual.

##### Log Files

Like many websites and mobile app providers, we may automatically gather certain information about our Website and App traffic and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, for the General Purposes, to track users’ use of the Services and to gather demographic information about our user base.

We may link this automatically collected data to Personal Information. IP addresses may be tied to Personal Information to troubleshoot access issues and ban users by IP from certain communities upon appropriate request.

We may use a third party tracking service that uses log files and cookies, see below, to track non- Personal Information about visitors to the Website in the aggregate. This service captures usage and volume statistics as well as geographical location data to compile usage reports and maps for optimization and troubleshooting purposes.

##### Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)

We may employ, and our third party advertising partners may employ, a software technology called clear gifs, also referred to as web beacons or web bugs, that help manage content on the Services by tracking what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.”

##### Information We Collect To Respond To Your Choices and Requests Registration.
