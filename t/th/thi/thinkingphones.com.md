# Fuze Privacy Policy I Fuze

**Fuze,** **respects your right to privacy. Please read below to understand more about our privacy policy.** **By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of information by Fuze. If our privacy policy changes, we will update this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.**

## Information Use and Disclosure

Fuze may use the information obtainable from a website for editorial and feedback purposes and for other purposes.

For example, Fuze may provide aggregate information to its in-house and independent sales representatives, use the information for marketing and promotional purposes, for a statistical analysis of user behavior, for product development, to inform advertisers as to how many visitors have seen or clicked on their advertisements, to target markets and to formulate our own proprietary and business strategies and plans. Any information that you actively provide to us, such as names, postal and email addresses, and phone numbers may be added to our databases and if you elect to allow such use, may be used by us to contact you regarding website updates, new products and services and for other purposes specifically allowed by you when you supply such information.

Fuze may retain the content of any customer service web form or email that Fuze receives, the email from which it is sent, and our response, if any. Content and other information related to emails sent by user to Fuze may be used as testimonials or for any other marketing purpose, except that no marketing communications unrelated to the subject matter of the submission will be sent to the email address from which such email or form is sent unless the user specifically elects to receive additional marketing materials or we obtain the email address through another avenue that permits such use. In all cases, email addresses may be compared to subscription or customer lists of Fuze and its business partners.

Where completion of a sale or shipment requires the use of information, such as credit card information, shipping addresses, or contact persons, Fuze may use the information to the extent necessary.

Fuze may use the information collected to analyze trends, administer websites, track user movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use, to monitor or to improve the use and satisfaction of a website, and to customize, upgrade, or configure the layout or content of a website.

Fuze may share and disclose aggregated user statistics and demographic information in order to describe our services to prospective and existing partners, advertisers, or other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. This information is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. Under confidentiality agreements, Fuze may match user information with third-party data. Fuze may disclose your personal information to business partners unless you directly inform us that you prefer we not do so.

## Links to Third Party Sites

The website may contain links to third party sites. Access to any other Internet site linked to the website is at the user’s own risk and Fuze is not responsible for the accuracy or reliability of any information, data, opinions, advice, statements, terms of use or privacy practices of such other sites unless it is also a website owned or controlled by Fuze. Fuze provides these links merely as a convenience and the inclusion of such links does not imply an endorsement of the site or their entities, products or services. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our website and to read the privacy statements of each and every site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by a website on the domains owned and controlled by Fuze.

## Security

Fuze’ websites take precautions to protect our users’ information. We use standard industry mechanisms to protect customer data from unauthorized access, for example, by using password protection and standard encryption methods. Transactions, access to transactional records, or access to account information occurs over a server that has safeguards such as secure server software (SSL) which encrypts information before transmission. You can confirm that pages are encrypted, and we urge you to do so before submitting or transmitting sensitive information, by viewing the lock icon on the bottom of most browsers.

You may edit your account information and account profile at any time using your email address and password. Do not divulge your password to anyone. Fuze will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited telephone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. Remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This may help to protect against access by others to your personal and business information if you share a computer or are using a computer in a public place.

By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of information by Fuze. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use at any time and for any reason. If our privacy policy changes, we will update this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. You agree that continued use of a website is an acknowledgment, consent and acceptance of any terms contained in our terms, conditions, practices and policies, including this Privacy Policy, as it may be amended from time to time.
