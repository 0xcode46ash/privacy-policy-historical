**Security**

Thinking Phone Networks Websites take precautions to protect our users' information.

You can confirm that pages are encrypted, and we urge you to do so before submitting or transmitting sensitive information, by viewing the lock icon on the bottom of most browsers.

You may edit your account information and account profile at any time using your email address and password. Do not divulge your password to anyone. Thinking Phone Networks will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited telephone call or in an unsolicited e-mail.
