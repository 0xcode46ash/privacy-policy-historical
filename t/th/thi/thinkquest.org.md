An example of personal information we do collect, is information that can be used to add a visitor to an email list or a mailing list. Personal information is also collected about participants in our programs, for the purposes of administering those programs and communicating with the participants. 

We will not make personal information available to outside organizations, except for organizations that work with us on the ThinkQuest programs. In that case, such personal information is used only for purposes related to the ThinkQuest programs. 

When requested, we will remove a person from our email list or mailing list. Please see the section explaining the procedure below.
