**ADVISOR MEDIA, INC.**  
**PRIVACY STATEMENT**  
Updated 29 October 2004

` `  
---  
Your privacy is important to Advisor Media, Inc. This statement describes how information from you, other Advisor Media customers, and users of the Advisor Network of Web sites, Advisor Store, Advisor e-newsletters, Advisor events, Advisor product registrations, and other products and services, is gathered and used.

**CUSTOMER INFORMATION**

You might voluntarily submit information to Advisor Media to conduct business with us, such as to subscribe to print and e-mail publications, to register for conferences and seminars, to register for access to certain areas of the Advisor Network, to buy products and services from Advisor, or to do anything else where you decide to provide information in order to purchase or participate. 

**E-MAIL FOR ADVISOR**

To be a supported Advisor customer, you should provide at least one functioning e-mail address so you can be contacted about your business activities with Advisor. Your e-mail address is used by Advisor Media to give you customer service, to provide requested information such as e-newsletters, to update you on requested or relevant information, to announce new Advisor Media and related products and services, and similar. If you do not provide Advisor with at least one valid e-mail address, you might be ineligible for certain Advisor Network access, products and services. You can always specify and change what kind of e-mail content and addresses you prefer; use the online Advisor Member Center or contact Advisor Customer Service. 

**E-MAIL FOR THIRD-PARTIES**

Advisor Media never gives your e-mail address to outsiders without your permission. If you have asked to receive special offers and information from third-party companies, such e-mail is sent directly by Advisor Media (or a secure e-mail service), not by the third-party companies, who are not given direct access to your e-mail addresses. The only exception is if you explicitly volunteer to share your address with a trusted third-party. When such an opportunity is available, you will clearly be asked whether you want to "opt-in" to the specified opportunity, which you may agree to or not, your choice. 

**IDENTIFICATION**

You can use much of the Advisor Network anonymously. To access most of the free features and areas, you don't need to log-in or provide any information about yourself. In some areas of the Advisor Network you must verify that you are an authorized customer by logging-in; we then use information you previously provided. Also, there are areas where we need information from you so we can provide what you are requesting, such as Advisor Network membership, e-newsletter subscriptions, event registration, subscriber online access, and other services. 

**LOGGING**

Certain activities are automatically logged by Web servers; this includes user IP addresses, URLs, pages visited, and sometimes cookies. Advisor Media aggregates and tabulates this information to analyze how the features and content of its Web sites are used. Some of this aggregated, tabulated information is provided to advertisers. Even if information about the activities of individuals happens to exist, it is not given to advertisers or anyone outside of Advisor Media without each individual's explicit permission. Some online advertising may come from third-party servers that log aggregate ad displays and clicks; any such information is never combined with the information logged by the Advisor Network.

**COOKIES**

Advisor Network Web sites sometimes use cookies to give you a personalized user experience and to let you move smoothly through the sites and pages. You must accept cookies to be able to log-in and read subscriber-only content. The format of Advisor Network cookies is proprietary and not available to any third-parties. You must accept cookies in Advisor Store, which is hosted by Yahoo, to place items in your shopping cart. Store cookies are not used by Advisor for any other purpose.

**CHILDREN**

Advisor Media is does not solicit information from children under the age of 13, accept Advisor Network members under 13, or normally provide products or services directed at children under 13. Because the Advisor Network is comprised of professional, business, technical and lifestyle information, determining suitability for older children is up to their parents. 

**INTERNATIONAL**

When you provide information, you agree to the transfer of your information to Advisor Media in countries or locations where privacy protection may be different from your country or location.

**LINKS**

When Advisor Media provides links to other Web sites or advertisers, it is for the convenience of users. Advisor Media is not responsible for the privacy policies, content or business practices of any other sites or businesses. You are solely responsible for determining the suitability and value of any Web site or content.

**QUESTIONS**

If you have questions about this Privacy Statement or the practices of Advisor Media, please go to [Advisor Help](http://help.advisor.com/).
