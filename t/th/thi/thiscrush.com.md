# ThisCrush - Privacy Policy

No personal information is required to start using ThisCrush.com. Any personal information you do provide, through means of creating an account or posting on other accounts, is done so at your own discretion. 

## I. Email

Giving ThisCrush.com your email address is currently optional. We do not, and will not, sell any email addresses provided. We use email addresses to send lost and forgotten usernames and passwords and opt-in notifications that someone posted to your Crush Page. 

## II. IP Address and Hostname

Simply by using the internet, your IP address and hostname is sent out as you visit web sites. This information is stored in access logs of the web sites you visit. In addition to this automatic logging, we save IP addresses of users when they create a CrushTag or post a crush. We use this information in situations of abuse of service, bullying, and other abnormal situations. 

## III. Crush Posts

When you post a crush on a Crush Page, it is there to stay. The only way it will be removed is if the owner of the Crush Page removes it or if it is deemed offensive or otherwise inappropriate by ThisCrush.com admin. Since crush posts are not linked to any registered account, we cannot rightfully declare ownership of any posted crushes. Meaning, just because you told us you posted it and want it removed, does not mean we can prove you posted it. Therefore, we will not remove crushes for reasons of "I posted it, I want it deleted". Furthermore, if you mark your post as private upon publishing, it will not be displayed publicly. Neither ThisCrush.com nor the Crush Page Owner is able to make such posts public from within ThisCrush. This does not limit the Crush Page Owner from taking screen shots or copying and pasting your post. 

## IV. Cookies

ThisCrush.com does not permanently store cookies on your computer, phone, or device as of the "Last Updated" date shown at the bottom of this policy. We do, however, use PHP "sessions" to keep you logged in while you're using the site. These sessions are cookie-based and will automatically expire when you close your browser, or after a short time of inactivity. Please refer to section V for information about cookies and advertisements.

## V. Advertisements

We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).

## VI. Privacy Updates

From time to time our Privacy information (this page) is subject to changes without notice.
