Effective August 31, 2009

**Introduction**

Your privacy is important to us.  You do not have to provide any personal information when you visit the Think Tank Photo, Inc. (“Think Tank Photo”) web site, but if you do provide information as part of an e-commerce transaction or during a product related inquiry, you should know that Think Tank Photo takes the following steps to better protect your privacy and to help you understand how your information is used.

This Privacy Policy Statement explains our online information practices.  To make this Privacy Policy Statement easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and on every page where our information collection practices are applicable.

**Scope**

This Privacy Policy Statement covers Think Tank Photo’s web site located at www.thinktankphoto.com (hereinafter referred to in this Privacy Policy Statement as the "Site").  The information collection practices covered by this Privacy Policy Statement refer to information an individual provides to Think Tank Photo ("Information").  The Site may contain hyperlinks to and from other Internet sites, including sites belonging to Think Tank Photo dealers, distributors and resellers.  Those sites may have different privacy practices from the ones described here.  Since this Privacy Policy Statement applies solely to this Site, please remember to read the Privacy Policy Statements of the other sites you visit.  For more information about hyperlinks, please see the Terms of Use posted elsewhere on this Site.

**The Information We Collect**

Think Tank Photo collects two forms of Information online: site visit Information and personal information.  Personal information is collected only when Site visitors voluntarily provide it.

**Site Visit Information** Think Tank Photo routinely gathers Information on Site activity, such as data on how many people visit the Site, the pages they visit, where they come from, how long they stay, and so forth. Site Visitor Information is:

• collected on an aggregate, anonymous basis, which means no Personal Information is associated with this data;

• gathered through the use of web server logs and cookies (A web server log is a file where web site activity is stored.  A cookie is a small piece of information that a web site sends to a visitor's computer and which is then stored on the visitor's hard drive.  Think Tank Photo uses cookies to track repeat visits to its Site.  Although Think Tank Photo assigns a cookie to a visitor's computer, it does not know who that visitor is unless that person specifically tells us.); and

• used to better design the Site.

**Personal Information**

Personal Information is collected on certain pages of the Site.  For example, if you decide to contact Think Tank Photo online to ask a question, learn more about a product or register a recently purchased product, place an order for products or repair service or inquire about products you may already own, you will find that those contact forms may ask for your name, e-mail and street address, telephone number and product type to assist us in completing a transaction or providing you with a high level of service and product upgrades.

Think Tank Photo may ask you to provide personal Information, some optional, some required, on specific pages of the Site, such as during e-commerce transactions and while obtaining online repair estimates.  The information requested may include your name, address, e-mail address, shipping information, phone number, product model(s) and serial number(s) and your date(s) of purchase, credit card and/or debit card information and your comments.  Personal Information may be forwarded to a Think Tank Photo business unit or the appropriate Think Tank Photo affiliate company that is equipped to handle your order, inquiry or feedback.

Personal Information may also be collected by means of warranty and product registration forms, trade show or product demonstration registration, e-mail and voluntary online surveys.  This contact information may be used to send follow-up e-mails and to provide product information.

Personal Information is also gathered as part of any entry for a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion.  You will be required to submit contact information such as your name, age, e-mail address, street address and phone number if you choose to enter a sweepstakes or other promotion we conduct.  We may also ask for additional information which is optional and is not required to enter the promotion.  We will use the required personal information you submit to us for promotion administration purposes, such as notification and verification of winners.

**How We Use Information**

We use the Information you provide about yourself online to provide you with information about other Think Tank Photo products and promotions that may be of interest to you.  Your Information may be shared with our employees, independent contractors, agents and/or business partners acting on our behalf to fulfill and/or ship an order, an award or rebate; conduct surveys, contests or sweepstakes; collect payments or to provide a product or service you have requested.  We do not share this information with other companies except to the extent necessary to complete your transaction and, when we do share it, it is subject to their agreement to treat it as confidential business information and with the understanding that it may not be used for any purpose other than to perform their specified function.

We may forward your information to a Think Tank Photo dealer, distributor or other reseller should you inquire about a product that Think Tank Photo does not sell directly.  Use of your information by the dealer, distributor or reseller in that event would be governed by its own policies, not Think Tank Photo's.  Think Tank Photo may also provide links to dealer, distributor and reseller sites from the Site.  See our discussion above and in our Terms of Use about hyperlinks for further information about such links.

We use return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail we receive as well as to provide you with product and service updates, and to notify you about special promotions and offers.

We use third party job posting services to advertise job openings and to help applicants submit their resume, job application or other employment information to Think Tank Photo.  These sites are not affiliated with Think Tank Photo and they maintain separate privacy policies that govern the transfer of your Information.  Should you have any questions about the privacy practices of these companies, we recommend that you contact them directly.

We may purchase the assets of another company or sell the assets of our company in the course of growing or restructuring our business.  During these transactions, information about customers is frequently considered a business asset that is the subject of such a purchase or sale.  Also, in the unlikely event that Think Tank Photo, or substantially all of its assets, are either acquired or subject to liquidation in bankruptcy, Information may be transferred as well.

We release Information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Think Tank Photo, Site users or others.  This includes exchanging Information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

We never use or share the personal Information you have provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to consent to such use.

**Data Security**

Think Tank Photo works hard to ensure that our systems meet industry security standards.  To help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard and secure the Information we collect online.  The security of personal information you may submit in connection with a promotion entry, survey response, and/or registration for any feature on the Site is of the utmost concern to us, and we strive to ensure its security on our systems.  However, because no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit such information at your own risk.  We will continue to assess new technology to evaluate its ability to provide additional protection of your Information.

**Children's Privacy**

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information from those we actually know are under thirteen year of age, nor does Think Tank Photo target its website to children under thirteen years of age.  Think Tank Photo encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate with them in the various interactive activities and downloadable projects that may be available on our Site from time to time.

**Right to Change Privacy Policy Statement**

If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy Statement, we will notify you by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address you most recently provided us (unless we do not have such an e-mail address) or by posting notice of the changes on our website.  Please check our website from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy Statement or any of our other policies.  Your continued use of our site following the postings of changes to these terms means you accept these changes.
