# WGBH ONLINE VISITORS' PRIVACY POLICY

**WGBH ONLINE VISITORS' PRIVACY POLICY**

* * *

WGBH knows you don't want the information you provide us shared indiscriminately. Here we explain how [WGBH Online](http://main.wgbh.org/) collects information, what we do with it, and what controls you have. We're committed to ensuring the privacy of your personally identifiable information, protecting the security of making financial transactions, and preserving the integrity of the medium. 

The privacy policy set forth here refers solely to [WGBH Online](http://main.wgbh.org/). Please read it carefully, and if you have any questions or concerns, send us an e-mail at [feedback@wgbh.org](mailto:feedback@wgbh.org). Also, note that we link to numerous other sites, such as [PBS](http://www.pbs.org/) and [NPR](http://www.npr.org/). Please consult those sites to learn more about their policies.

**Gathering and Use of Information**

[WGBH Online](http://main.wgbh.org/) does not collect personally identifiable information from our visitors other than what is supplied to us on a voluntary basis (such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and/or other identifying information) when you e-mail us or respond to surveys, for example.

As a visitor to the WGBH Web site, you may be requested to supply certain personally identifiable information in order to participate in some activities. These include becoming a WGBH member, pledging financial support, and making an e-commerce transaction. You may be asked to provide information for contest registration or to subscribe to special services (such as e-mail newsletters).

Personally identifiable information also may be requested in connection with certain content submissions, community postings (e.g., forums or bulletin boards), comments and suggestions, or voting.

You should recognize that under certain circumstances, if you choose not to voluntarily submit requested information you may not be eligible for certain activities -- e.g., online-only contests -- for which personally identifiable information is needed. 

**E-mail Addresses and E-mail Mailing Lists**

WGBH maintains a customer database with e-mail addresses of viewers and listeners who have provided them to WGBH by e-mailing us with questions about membership, submitting an online membership contribution (making an online pledge), or sending us an e-mail about our programs or services. We will use these addresses to send our constituents information about WGBH programs, services, or membership. The e-mail mailing lists are for the sole use of WGBH. We do not sell, exchange, or lend out our e-mail list to outside companies, organizations, or individuals. You can have your e-mail address removed from the WGBH e-mail list at any time by going to [WGBH Online's "Contact Us" page](http://www.wgbh.org/contact/) and using the "Feedback Form." If you have already opted out, rest assured that we will continue to honor your request. 

WGBH Donor Postal Address List Like many nonprofits, we occasionally exchange portions of our Donor Postal Address List with other carefully selected nonprofit educational, cultural, health, and social service organizations in the communities WGBH serves. When you make an online contribution, your name and address will be included on this exchanged list. Please note that on every online contribution form, we give you the opportunity to opt out of having your name and address added to our Donor Postal Address List. We HAVE NOT and WILL NEVER share or exchange our donors' e-mail addresses or phone numbers with any third party. Our exchange list program provides other nonprofits with only your name and postal address.

If at any time you would like to check or update our record of your information, please let us know either by calling the WGBH Member Hotline at 617-300-3300, Monday-Friday between 9am and 5pm EST; by writing to us at WGBH, Box 200, Boston, MA 02134; or by [using our online form](http://www.wgbh.org/contact/). If you already have opted out of having your information added to our Donor Postal Address List, we will continue to honor your request.

**Secure Credit Card Transactions**

[WGBH Online](http://main.wgbh.org/) offers you the convenience of making purchases and membership contributions via credit card. WGBH takes seriously the need for credit card account information security. Our Web financial transaction forms are stored and served from a secure server. This means that each page you view and any information you submit is encrypted on its way between computers (yours and ours). Even in the highly unlikely event that your transmission is intercepted, it will not be usable. Your peace of mind and the safeguarding of your credit card information is a top priority for us. All online credit card transactions are done through a Netscape Secure Server using 40-bit SSL; you know you're on a secure page when the Web address starts with "https" (the "s" is for "secure"). Your credit card information is used only for your intended purpose - that is, for the purchase or contribution you wish to make.

**Cookies and Browsers**

A "cookie" on the Web is a unique number assigned by a Web site to a user's visit to that site. In general, cookies are used to customize user experience, count how many people visit a site, and track which pages on a site receive visits. 

WGBH Online uses cookies to help us determine how visitors use our site so we can improve your online experience. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information and are used only by us, in order to provide better statistics on traffic throughout our site. [WGBH Online](http://main.wgbh.org/) cookies expire when you quit your browser. They are not saved to your computer's hard disk. 

When visiting any Web site, your browser sends information to the site's hosting server identifying the browser you're using, your Internet service provider (ISP), the page you last visited, and the page you're currently visiting. Your browser does not, however, send any personally identifying information to Web sites unless you explicitly provide that information in a form. Thus, WGBH Online cannot extract any personally identifying information about you from what we receive via your browser.

**Acceptance of this WGBH Online Visitors' Privacy Policy**

By using this site, you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of this WGBH Online Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, please do not use this site. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of [WGBH Online](http://main.wgbh.org/) following the posting of any changes to these terms shall mean that you have accepted those changes. If you have any questions or concerns, please e-mail us at [feedback@wgbh.org](mailto:feedback@wgbh.org).
