# About Us - Privacy Statement

**ThirdAge.com Privacy Policy**

Respecting the privacy of our members   
and guests is one of our deepest concerns at ThirdAge.com. We recognize that our members are our most important asset,   
and we strive to protect their interests at all times and in all areas of our community. 

We feel strongly that our environment offers little value if members do not feel a sense of security and safety while participating. 

**This privacy statement provides you with answers to the following questions:**   


  
**1. What personal information does ThirdAge.com collect? Why?**   
When you register to be a member or subscribe to one or more of our newsletters, ThirdAge asks for your name and/or email address. This information will allow us to help members and subscribers recover information about their account should it be forgotten and to send information about products and services we think our members will find valuable. 

Additionally, we may ask for personal information when you enter a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion; order merchandise from our shop; request free samples that may be offered from time to time; post a personals ad; utilize our services or the services of content providers featured on our site. 

We may also collect various pieces of visitor information to track the use of the ThirdAge.com site and to improve our visitors' online experience. This information might include the visitor's domain name or IP address, and the visitor's browser and platform type. This helps ThirdAge.com to provide the best information in the best format. 

ThirdAge uses a standard Internet technology called "cookies" to store and track visitor information. A cookie is a small text file that a server can automatically store on your computer and retrieve later. Cookies allow us to count the number of unique visitors to the site to measure traffic patterns on our site, personalize a visitor's experience on our site, and facilitate the login process for registered members. 

For more information on cookies please see [the definition of cookie](http://www.thirdage.com/cgi-bin/glosdb.cgi?glos_name=tech&action=view&term_name=Cookie). Or take the [Crumbling the Magic Cookie](https://web.archive.org/insider/tech/david/907093629.html) quiz. 

**2. Does ThirdAge.com share this information with anyone?** ThirdAge.com does not offer, give, or sell personal information given to us by members, subscribers, or users to a third party (other than our sponsors as described below) without individual member, subscriber, or user consent. All members remain free to request anonymity at any time when participating in community areas. We do not show a member or subscriber's information to other participants unless the member or subscriber specifically authorizes us to release such information. 

Some of our services or promotions are offered through an affiliation with another company in what we call a "co-branded" area of our site or through a co-sponsored promotion, and visitor information may be shared with those partners and/or sponsors. For example if you request information about or from our partners or sponsors or visit a co-branded or sponsor-specific area of the site, you give ThirdAge permission to provide information about you (such as your email address) to the partner or sponsor. 

We may also combine demographic information about you with similar information about other users and share such aggregated, non-personally identifiable demographic information with our advertisers, sponsors, and other business partners. 

Finally, we must reserve the right to disclose personal information if required by law enforcement, judicial, or other governmental authorities. 

**3. Can members and subscribers opt out of having their information shared? How?**   
Members and subscribers can request that their personal information not be shared. All newsletter subscribers may visit the [newsstand](https://web.archive.org/news/newsstand/) at any time to check their settings. To ensure that an email address is not used for anything other than newsletter delivery, the box marked "Announcements" should remain unchecked. ThirdAge members may visit [Member Preferences](https://web.archive.org/join/editlogin.html) to designate if they would like to share their email address with other members by clicking on the appropriate button. 

**4. How can members and subscribers update the personal information they have shared with ThirdAge.com?**   
Members should visit [Member Preferences](https://web.archive.org/join/editlogin.html) to update or change the personal information they provided upon registration. Specific changes in the settings of various member areas, such as Forums, Circles, HomePages and Free Email, must be made in the preferences area for those specific tools. 

Newsletter subscribers should visit the [newsstand](https://web.archive.org/news/newsstand/) to change settings or unsubscribe. 

Please note that registered members will need to visit the [newsstand](https://web.archive.org/news/newsstand/) to make changes to newsletter subscriptions. These changes cannot be made in the Member Preferences area. 

**5. Can member and subscriber information be removed from ThirdAge.com? How?**   
Any member may have their account deleted by emailing support@thirdage.com with a request. Newsletter subscribers and members who receive newsletters may simply access the [newsstand](https://web.archive.org/news/newsstand/) to unsubscribe from any and all newsletters. Subscribers may also send requests to noemail@thirdage.com to be removed from all newsletters. 

**A Commitment to Our Community**   
As a company we are committed to keeping individual and community interests our main focus, and we strive to maintain confidentiality of the information our users provide to us. We only ask for information that will help us to provide specific and valuable services. All members remain free to request anonymity at any time, even when participating in forums, chat, HomePages, and Personals. Please remember that information displayed in chat rooms, forums, and other community areas becomes public, so exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information there. 

Thank you for being a part of ThirdAge.com! The ThirdAge Team
