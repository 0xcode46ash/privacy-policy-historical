ThirdAge.com Privacy Policy

**Guiding Principles**  
1\. Respecting the privacy of our members and guests is one of our deepest concerns at ThirdAge.com. We recognize that our members are our most important asset, and we strive to protect their interests at all times and in all areas of our community. 

2\. We believe that our environment offers little value if members do not feel a sense of security and safety while participating. 

**This privacy statement provides you with answers to the following questions:**  
1\. What personal information does ThirdAge.com collect? Why?  
2\. Does ThirdAge.com share this information with anyone?  
3\. Can members and subscribers opt out of having their information shared? How?  
4\. How can members and subscribers update the personal information they have shared with ThirdAge.com?  
5\. Can member and subscriber information be removed from ThirdAge.com? How?  
6\. Tell me about the ads on ThirdAge.com. Do those ads place cookies on my computer? What information do those cookies collect?

**1\. What personal information does ThirdAge.com collect? Why?**  
When you register to be a member or subscribe to one or more of our newsletters, ThirdAge asks for your name and/or e-mail address. This information allows us to help members and subscribers recover information about their account should it be forgotten and to send information about products and services we think our members will find valuable. 

Additionally, we may ask for personal information when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion; order merchandise from our shop; request free samples that may be offered from time to time; post a personals ad; utilize our services or the services of content providers featured on our site. 

We may also collect various pieces of visitor information to track the use of the ThirdAge.com site and to improve our visitors' online experience. This information might include the visitor's domain name or IP address, and the visitor's browser and platform type. This helps ThirdAge.com to provide the best information in the best format. 

ThirdAge uses a standard Internet technology called "cookies" to store and track visitor information. A cookie is a small text file that a server can automatically store on your computer and retrieve later. Cookies allow us to count the number of unique visitors to the site to measure traffic patterns, personalize a visitor's experience and facilitate the login process for registered members. If you do not wish to have your browser accept cookies, the "Help" section of most browsers has instructions for disabling cookies and/or requesting that the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie.

In the course of serving advertisements onto ThirdAge.com, DoubleClick, our third-party advertising partner, may also place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Information about your visit to ThirdAge.com, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you. For more information about DoubleClick, cookies, and how to "opt-out", please click [here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy). 

For more information on cookies please see this [definition](https://web.archive.org/cgi-bin/glosdb.cgi?glos_name=tech&action=view&term_name=Cookie) or take the [Crumbling the Magic Cookie](https://web.archive.org/insider/tech/david/907093629.html) quiz. 

**2\. Does ThirdAge.com share this information with anyone?**  
ThirdAge believes that its members and users and the information they have provided to ThirdAge are important to its business. ThirdAge does not share that information with unaffiliated third parties except as set forth below. 

Some of our services or promotions are offered through an affiliation with another company in what we call a "co-branded" area of our site or through a co-sponsored promotion, and visitor information may be shared with those partners and/or sponsors. For example, if you request information about or from our partners or sponsors, or visit a co-branded or sponsor-specific area of the site, you give ThirdAge permission to provide information about you (such as your e-mail address) to the partner or sponsor. 

Additionally, in the event that the operation and control of ThirdAge.com is transferred to another entity, or if ThirdAge Inc. is, or substantially all of its assets are, acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets. 

We may also combine demographic information about you with similar information about other users and share such aggregated, non-personally identifiable demographic information with our advertisers, sponsors and other business partners. 

Finally, we must reserve the right to disclose personal information if required by law enforcement, judicial or other governmental authorities. 

Other than as described as above, ThirdAge does not offer, give or sell personal information given to us by members, subscribers or users to a third party (other than our sponsors as described below) without individual member, subscriber or user consent. All members remain free to request anonymity at any time when participating in community areas. We do not show a member or subscriber's information to other participants unless the member or subscriber specifically authorizes us to release such information. 

**3\. Can members and subscribers opt out of having their information shared? How?**  
Members and subscribers can request that their personal information not be shared. All newsletter subscribers may visit the [Newsstand](https://web.archive.org/news/newsstand/) at any time to check their settings. To ensure that an e-mail address is not used for anything other than newsletter delivery, the box marked "Announcements" should remain unchecked. ThirdAge members may visit [Member Preferences](https://web.archive.org/join/editlogin.html) to designate whether they would like to share their e-mail addresses with other members by clicking on the appropriate button. 

**4\. How can members and subscribers update the personal information they have shared with ThirdAge.com?**  
Members should visit [Member Preferences](https://web.archive.org/join/editlogin.html) to update or change the personal information they provided upon registration. Specific changes in the settings of various member areas, such as Forums, Circles, HomePages and Free E-mail, must be made in the "Preferences" areas of those specific tools. 

Newsletter subscribers should visit the [Newsstand](https://web.archive.org/news/newsstand/) to change settings or unsubscribe. 

Please note that registered members will need to visit the [Newsstand](https://web.archive.org/news/newsstand/) to make changes to newsletter subscriptions. These changes cannot be made in the Member Preferences area. 

**5\. Can member and subscriber information be removed from ThirdAge.com? How?**  
Any member or registered user may have his or her account deleted by sending an e-mail to [supporthelp@thirdage.com](mailto:supporthelp@thirdage.com) with this request. Newsletter subscribers and members who receive newsletters may simply access the [Newsstand](https://web.archive.org/news/newsstand/) to unsubscribe from any and all newsletters. 

**6\. Tell me about the ads on ThirdAge.com. Do those ads place cookies on my computer? What information do those cookies collect?**  
The ads appearing on ThirdAge.com are delivered to you by DoubleClick, our Web advertising partner. Information about your visit to ThirdAge.com, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you. For more information about DoubleClick, cookies, and how to "opt-out", please click [here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy).

In the course of serving advertisements onto ThirdAge.com, DoubleClick may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. 

**A Commitment to Our Community**  
As a company we are committed to keeping individual and community interests as our main focus, and we strive to maintain confidentiality of the information our users provide to us. We only ask for information that will help us to provide specific and valuable services. All members remain free to request anonymity at any time, even when participating in forums, chat, HomePages and Personals. Please remember that information displayed in chat rooms, forums and other community areas becomes public, so exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information in those areas. 

We'd like to underscore that we encourage you to familiarize yourself with this policy and our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/about/terms.html), which may change from time to time due to the dynamic nature of the Internet. 

Thank you for being a part of ThirdAge.com!
