  * **_About cookies_**

On 26 May 2011, the rules about cookies on websites changed. This site uses cookies. You may delete and block all cookies from this site, but parts of the site will not work. To find out more about cookies and how to delete them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.  
A cookie is a small file that can be stored on your computer's hard drive. Thorntons uses cookies to provide features like auto-log-in and to determine when customers have previously visited our site. Our cookies do not contain any personal information about you, so only Thorntons will be able to use the cookies to determine your identity.

  * **_Customer Account_**

When you create a new user account at Thorntons.co.uk we collect your name and email address. When you place an order for a product that requires payment, we also collect your credit card billing address, credit card information, and telephone number. This information will be used to process orders and, if necessary, to contact you regarding the status of your orders.

In order to develop our business we do use some of the collected data including recipient details to profile you and your order profile. This data is used to improve our service to you and identify new customers who we should be marketing to. This involves passing information onto selected third party companies.

  * **_Opt-in Policy_**

Within the Thorntons.co.uk site, we have to gather information from you to process your order. As part of this, we will proactively opt you in to receive marketing communications from Thorntons (for example, text messages, emails and catalogues). Should you wish to opt-out at any time, simply call 0845 121 1911 or log in and click on 'Account' to change your 'opt-in' status and we will update your account. We will not share your information with third parties for marketing purposes

  * **_Sharing your information with other companies_**

We have a firm commitment to protect your privacy and security as our customer. We are obliged by the Distance Selling Directive, and the Data Protection legislation, and all current Trade and Legal precedents and policies to respect your wishes. You can at any time contact us and we will OPT you out of any aspect of our marketing programme.

  * **_Purchase History_**

A record is kept of your purchases. Your previous orders may be used to present you with the most relevant products and gift ideas and to provide you with a better overall user experience. You have the right through Data Protection legislation to request, for a small fee, any data we hold on you. Please contact us on  44 (0) 845 121 1911 if you wish to enquire about the data we hold.

  * **_How do I tell Thorntons that I do not want to be contacted for promotional purposes?_**

Simply log in and click on 'Account' to change your 'Opt-In' status.  
Alternatively, you can contact us by [clicking here](https://web.archive.org/contact/Thorntons/).

  * **_Will my customer contact information be disclosed to third parties?_**

We do not disclose your information to third parties for marketing purposes. Thorntons also reserves the right to co-operate with law enforcement officials in the investigation of alleged unlawful activities of our customers or relating to our customers. We will have no legal liability for such disclosures.

  * **_Are my personal messages private when I purchase gifts?_**

When you add a personal message to an order, your message will be printed on a gift card that is part of the dispatch stationery. This is positioned so the message cannot be read during transit.

  * **_What is an IP address and how does Thorntons use them?_**

An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when connected to the Internet. The servers that serve our web site automatically identify your computer by its IP address. This is used exclusively to highlight orders that appear abnormal, (i.e. Multiple credit card numbers being used) in order to identify the source of fraudulent orders.

  * **_Does Thorntons ensure the privacy practices of other sites to which it provides links?_**

While we carefully select the websites to which we link, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these websites.

  * **_How will I know when Thorntons.co.uk changes its privacy policy?_**

Our privacy policy is regularly reviewed to make sure we continue to serve the privacy interests of our customers. We reserve the right to change and update the privacy policy and these changes will be posted on our web site. We encourage you to visit this page from time to time to ensure you are aware of any changes we may have made.
