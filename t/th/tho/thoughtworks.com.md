Additionally, we collect information directly from you in a number of ways, including through the use of cookies. Cookies are small files of information which save and retrieve information about your visit to the ThoughtWorks website for example, how you entered our site, how you navigated through the site, and what information was of interest to you. The cookies we use identify you merely as a number. However, if you are uncomfortable regarding the use of cookies, you can disable cookies on your computer by changing the settings in preferences or options menu in your browser. 

We also collect information directly when you voluntarily submit it to us. We may provide the opportunity to sign-up for a periodic email newsletter by entering in your email address. It is completely up to you whether or not you want to provide it. Additionally, we collect personal information when you apply online for a job opening at ThoughtWorks.

We analyse the information we gather to determine what is most effective about our site, to help us identify ways to improve it, and eventually, to determine how we can tailor the ThoughtWorks website to make it more effective. 

The personal information ThoughtWorks collects when you apply online for ThoughtWorks employment opportunities is used to determine whether to pursue an employment relationship and for the purposes of our equal opportunity monitoring. 

We may also use data for other purposes, which we would describe to you at the point we collect the information. 

D) Will we share this with non-ThoughtWorks parties? 

Information that we collect may be stored and processed in and transferred between any of the countries in which ThoughtWorks, its respective partners, affiliates or contractors, has offices in order to enable ThoughtWorks to use the information as set out in this Online Privacy Policy. If you are in the European Union, Canada or Australia, information which you provide may be transferred to countries (including the United States) which do not have data protection laws equivalent to those in force in the European Union, Canada or Australia. You expressly agree to such transfers. ThoughtWorks will only share personal information with non-ThoughtWorks parties with your consent, as required by law or to protect ThoughtWorks, its customers, or the public, or with companies that help us fulfil our obligations with you, and then only with partners who share ThoughtWorks' commitment to protecting your privacy and data. We will respect and protect your privacy as set out in this Online Privacy Policy and we will not sell individual information. 

You may find links to third party websites on our Website. These sites are owned and operated independently of us and may collect information about you.
