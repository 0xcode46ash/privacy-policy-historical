By using the services of the service providers, users of the website enter into a contractual relationship with the respective service provider that is governed by the corresponding contractual terms and conditions of the service provider.

Any further liability for damages shall be excluded. The provisions of the German Product Liability Act and other mandatory legal statutes shall remain unaffected.

In the event of a negligent breach of a material contractual obligation, the liability of Musikhaus Thomann shall be limited in terms of nature and scope to such typical damages as may have been reasonably foreseeable at the date of the conclusion of the Agreement.

Such information on your part is relevant for your enquiry, but you provide it on a voluntary basis.

**We will neither sell to any third party nor otherwise market any of your personal data!**

You may revoke such consent at any time without any formal requirements. For example, you may send your revocation to the following address:

In addition to the types of use described above, Musikhaus Thomann will transfer your data to third parties that are involved in the processing of your order or that participate in contracts. For example, if you place an order via our website, we will transmit your order information to Thomann partner companies and contractors who process and deliver your order to you. Data will only be transmitted to the extent required in order to fulfil or deliver your order or to process an enquiry. We will also transmit personal data to third parties where we are required to do so by law.

Musikhaus Thomann will not transmit any personal data relating to the users of our website if we do not have specific permission to do so. We do not sell user names or email addresses to any other companies that may send you unwanted advertising material or mail.  
Third party advertisements or links to other websites displayed on our website may collect user data if you click on them or otherwise follow their instructions. We have no control over the data collected either voluntarily or involuntarily via advertisements or websites of third parties. We recommend that you read the privacy policies of the promoted websites if you have any concerns regarding the collection and use of your data.

### Data automatically collected on our website / usage data

We welcome anybody to visit and use our website free of charge and to look at the products on offer. When you visit our website, we record your IP address (i.e. the internet address of your computer – not your email address) and other general usage data in order to assess which parts of our website you visit and how long you stay there.

Such data will be combined with the usage data of all visitors to our website in order to measure the number of visitors, the average time of the visits, pages visited, etc. The data we collect is combined and used for internal purposes only. This does not enable any identification of you as a person.

We use this combined data for evaluating our products, services and the news we make available via our website, as well as for monitoring use of our website and generally improving its content.

### Cookies

Like many other commercial websites, Musikhaus Thomann sometimes uses the technology known as "cookies" to collect information on how you use the website, and to ensure your visit runs smoothly.

Our cookies neither disclose nor contain any personal data. Cookies cannot read any information from your computer or interact with other cookies on your hard disk. However, cookies enable us to recognize you when you revisit our website.

**If you do not want your browser to accept cookies, you can deactivate this option in your browser settings.**

Deactivation of cookies may prevent this website from functioning properly. You may not be able to access all the options and information on this website.

### Google Analytics and Google AdSense

#### Google Analytics

The Musikhaus Thomann website utilises Google Analytics, a web analytics tool by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies", text files that are saved on your computer and that enable an analysis of your use of the website. Usually, the cookie-generated information regarding your use of the website is transmitted to, and saved on, a Google server in the United States. In the event of an IP anonymisation on this website, however, Google will first shorten your IP address within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only by way of exception will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and shortened there. Google will use such information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on the website activities and to provide other services to Musikhaus Thomann in relation to website use and internet use. Google will not combine the IP address transmitted by your browser via Google Analytics with other Google data. You can prevent cookies being saved by selecting the corresponding browser setting; however, we would like to point out that you may then not be able to fully use all of our website’s options. Furthermore, you can prevent collection and transfer of the data generated by cookies on www.thomann.de and relating to your use of the website (including your IP address) to Google, as well as the processing of such data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link: <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/eula.html?hl=de>.

#### Google AdSense

Our website also utilises Google AdSense, a Google Inc. service that allows Google to place automatically generated, content-related advertisements on our website. For further information on Google AdSense, please see <http://www.google.de/adsense>. Just like Google Analytics, Google AdSense uses cookies that are saved on your computer and that enable an analysis of your use of our website. Additionally, Google AdSense utilises "web beacons" (invisible graphics), which also enable an evaluation of your use of our website. The information regarding the use of this website (including your IP address) generated by cookies and web beacons, and the delivery of advertising formats, are transferred to a Google server, where they are saved. Google uses such information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services to Musikhaus Thomann in relation to website and internet use. Furthermore, Google may pass on this data to its advertising partners. We would like to point out that, in contrast to Google Analytics, Google has as yet not taken measures to anonymise your IP address for its Google AdSense service. Therefore, in addition to the previously mentioned data relating to your use of our website, your IP address will also be transferred to, and saved on, a Google server. You can prevent cookies from being saved by choosing the corresponding browser setting; however, we would like to point out that, in this case, you may not be able to fully use all of our website’s functions.

Only then can you link the www.thomann.de web pages you have visited to your account at the respective social network service and share them with other users of such services (e.g. on Facebook via the "Share" feature).
