# Thomasville Furniture Privacy Policy

###### Privacy Policy

Furniture Brands International Inc. and our brands, which include but are not limited to Thomasville, Drexel Heritage, Broyhill, Henredon, Hickory Chair, Labarge, Lane, Laneventure, Maitland-Smith and Pearson, value our customers and respect your privacy. The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform you what Personal Information we may collect from you, how we use such information, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to review and correct the information. This policy applies only to customers in the United States who have provided Personal Information to us through the Sites. 

For purposes of this policy, "Personal Information" means any information by which you can be personally identified, and includes your name, your address, your telephone number, your e-mail address and the like. Most of our websites do not require that you submit Personal Information to us. There may be times (such as when you purchase or order a product or register to participate in contests, etc.) when we ask you to provide certain information about yourself, such as your name, shipping/billing address, telephone number, email address, credit card information, etc., and if you make a purchase, we may also maintain a record of your product purchases. In addition, our web servers may automatically recognize information regarding your domain name (or that of your access provider) and e-mail address, and we may use this data for trends and statistics, but individual users will remain anonymous, unless you voluntarily tell us who you are. 

In general, we use the Personal Information you provide only for internal purposes, such as:

  * for the specific purpose for which it was volunteered (for example, to complete a product purchase, to enter a contest, to answer an e-mail, etc.);
  * to improve the content, appearance and utility of our websites;
  * to track our visitors' use of our websites for internal market research; and
  * to notify our visitors of updates to the websites or of new products or services.



From time to time, we may contract with companies or persons to provide certain services including credit card processing, shipping, data management, promotional services, etc. We may provide these providers with the information needed for them to perform these services. From time to time we might also establish a business relationship with other persons or entities whom we believe trustworthy. In such cases we might rent, exchange, share and/or cross-reference information, including contact information about you that will enable such persons or entities to contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest to you. In addition, we may use third-party advertising companies to serve or track ads on our website and other websites. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to measure advertising effectiveness and to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. 

In addition, we may operate sweepstakes, contests, raffles and similar promotions through our website that may require online registration. We typically ask you for certain personally identifiable information when you enter and, if applicable, win a sweepstake, contest, raffle or similar promotion. We may share this personally identifiable information with third party sponsors of such sweepstakes, contests, raffles and promotions (irrespective of whether it is hosted by us), or otherwise in accordance with the rules applicable to such sweepstakes, contest, raffle or promotion. You should carefully review the rules of each sweepstake, contest, raffle and promotion in which you participate through our website, as they may contain additional important information about our or a sponsor's use of your personally identifiable information. Insofar as the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of your personally identifiable information conflict with this privacy statement, the terms and conditions of such rules shall control. 

#### Editing, Updating, Correcting and Deleting Information About You

We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. If you prefer not to receive direct marketing from us or from any third parties, or if you would like to opt out of our sharing your information with other marketers, please let us know. To edit or update your Personal Information or if you prefer not to receive information from us or any or all of our brands or any third parties, you can do so by contacting us by email or postal mail at the addresses below. Please be sure to include your email address, mailing address, full name, and specifically what information you do not want to receive.
