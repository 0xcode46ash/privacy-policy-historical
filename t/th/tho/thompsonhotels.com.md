# Privacy Policy | Thompson Hotels

Thompson Hotels, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Commune Hotel and Resorts, LLC (“Commune”) and Commune’s privacy policies apply equally to Thompson Hotels, LLC. At Commune the privacy and confidentiality of user information is important. We are committed to maintaining the privacy and security of your user information. We may update this policy from time to time, so please check here frequently.

Commune is committed to safeguarding your privacy while visiting the Commune websites, namely, [www.communehotels.com](http://www.communehotels.com/), [www.thompsonhotels.com](http://www.thompsonhotels.com/), and [www.jdvhotels.com](http://www.jdvhotels.com/), (hereinafter all identified URLs are collectively referred to as the "Site"). Our goal is to provide you with an Internet experience that delivers the information, resources and services that are most relevant to you. To achieve this goal, part of the operation of the Site includes the gathering of certain types of information about Site users. Because we understand that your privacy is important, we wish to explain the types of information we gather and the way in which we use it. This Privacy Policy applies to the Site.

This Privacy Policy covers two types of information gathered at the Site, personal and aggregated. The term "Personal Information" refers to data you voluntarily provide in connection with use of the Site that identifies you and/or the company on whose behalf you are accessing and using the Site. Personal Information includes, e.g., data submitted in connection with our services, such as your name, e-mail address, phone number, company affiliation, physical address and/or certain other personal information. The term "Aggregated Data" refers to general information regarding visitors and users of the Site that relates to use of the Site, e.g., traffic patterns, number of visits to certain pages, visits from other web sites or to third-party web sites linked to the Site, use of particular services and interest in services, information or features of the Site or other parties made available through or found at the Site.

#### What information is collected about you? How do we use it?

We take the utmost care to ensure that the Personal Information we obtain from you is not used in a way that you may be unaware of or are not agreeable to. You may wish to submit an information request about Commune, participate in one of our promotions or subscribe to our e-mail or postal mail lists. In response, we may ask for information such as your name, email or postal address. In the event you opt to provide us with this information, we will only use it for the purpose specified by you at the bottom of the information gathering form.

#### Information collected on the Site may be used to:

  * Register you as a hotel member
  * Plan and purchase hotel accommodations
  * Enter your email in our promotions or sweepstakes
  * Send marketing communications or surveys to you
  * Respond to your questions or suggestions
  * Improve the quality of your visit to the site



#### Withdrawing Consent to Use

If, after permitting use of your Personal Information, you later decide that you no longer want Commune to include you on its mailing list or otherwise contact you or use your personal information in the manner disclosed in this Privacy Policy or at the Site, simply tell us by sending an e-mail, or by clicking on the “Opt-out” or the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of our email communication to you.

In deciding whether or to opt out of or unsubscribe from such lists and future online marketing, please note that they are only used for Commune purposes or in joint promotions with a Commune partner or affiliate. We do not sell, rent or share any of your personal information with any other party including any non-affiliated third-party joint promoters, nor use it for unapproved commercial purposes.

#### Permission for Use

Commune may collect and use Personal Information that you submit at the Site in any manner that is consistent with uses stated in this Privacy Policy or disclosed elsewhere at the Site at the point you submit such Personal Information. At the time you submit Personal Information or make a request, the intended use of the information you submit will be apparent in the context in which you submit it and/or because the Site states the intended purpose. By submitting Personal Information at the Site, you are giving your consent and permission for any use that is consistent with uses stated in this Privacy Policy or disclosed elsewhere at the Site at the point you submit such Personal Information. Please do not request any such communications on behalf of an individual or company unless you are authorized to make the request.

#### Protecting your information

Commune would like Site visitors to feel confident about using the Site to plan and purchase their accommodations, so Commune is committed to protecting the information we collect. Commune has implemented a security program to keep information that is stored in our systems protected from unauthorized access.

Our Site is hosted in a secure environment. The Site servers/systems are configured with data encryption, or scrambling, technologies, and industry-standard firewalls. When you enter personal information during the reservation process, or during a customer email sign-up, your data is protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure safe transmission.

#### Use of Aggregated Data

Commune is interested in improving the Site and may develop and offer new features and services. We monitor Aggregated data regarding use of the Site for marketing purposes and to study, improve and promote use of the Site. In connection with such purposes, Commune may share Aggregated data with third parties collectively and in an anonymous way. Disclosure of Aggregated data does not reveal personal information about individual Site users in any way that identifies who they are or how to contact them.

##### EXCEPTIONS TO THE PRIVACY POLICY

**Commune has three exceptions to these limits on use of personal information:**

(1) Commune may monitor and, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is required, disclose information to protect the security, property, assets and/or rights of Commune, its affiliates, employees, officers, owners and agents from unauthorized use, or misuse, of the Site or anything found at the Site.

(2) Commune may disclose information when required by law; however, only to the extent necessary and in a manner that seeks to maintain the privacy of the individual.

(3) In order to accommodate changes in our business, we may sell portions of our company including information collected through the Site. If Commune sells substantially all of its assets, Personal Information will be one of the assets transferred to the acquirer.

#### Use of Cookies

To enable features at the Site, Commune may assign one or more "cookies" to your Internet browser. Cookies, among other things, speed navigation through our Site, keep track of information so that you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our Site, and may provide you with customized content. A cookie is an Internet mechanism composed of a small text file containing a unique identification number that permits a web server to send small pieces of information or text by means of your browser and place them on your computer's hard drive for storage. This text lets the web server know if you have previously visited the web page. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out the identity of any user.

We use cookies to collect and maintain Aggregated data (such as the number of visitors) to help us see which areas are most popular with our users and improve and update the content on our site. While in the process of browsing our site, you also provide us with information that doesn't reveal your personal identity -- what type of destination you're exploring, for example. We use this Aggregated data only as explained in this Privacy Policy. We do not connect Aggregated data to any name, address, or other identifying information.

You may occasionally receive cookies from unaffiliated companies or organizations, to the extent they place advertising on our Site or are linked to the Site. These third-party cookies may collect information about you when you "click" on their advertising or content or link. This practice is standard in the Internet industry. Because of the way in which the Internet operates, we cannot control collection of this information by these third parties, and these cookies are not subject to this Privacy Policy.

#### Children's Privacy & Parental Consent

Please be aware that Commune has not designed this Site for, and does not intend for it to be used by, anyone under age 18. Accordingly, this Site should not be used by anyone under age 18. Our privacy policy prohibits us from accepting users who are under the age of 18. Commune specifically requests that persons under the age of 18 not use this Site or submit or post information to the Site. Should Commune inadvertently acquire Personal Information or other data from users under the age of 18, Commune will not knowingly provide this data to any third party for any purpose whatsoever, and any subsequent disclosure would be due to the fact the user under age 18 used the Site and submitted personal information without solicitation by or permission from Commune.

#### Links Provided To Other Sites

Commune may provide links to a number of other web sites that we believe might offer you useful information and services. However, those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as Commune. Therefore, we are not responsible for the privacy policies or the actions of any third parties, including without limitation, any web site owners whose sites may be reached through this Site, nor can we control the activities of those web sites. We urge you to contact the relevant parties controlling these sites or accessing their on-line policies for the relevant information about their data collection practices before submitting any personal information or other sensitive data.

#### Your Consent To This Privacy Policy

Use of the Site signifies your consent, as well as the consent of the company for whom you use the Site and whose information you submit (if any), to this on-line Privacy Policy, including the collection and use of information by Commune, as described in this statement, and also signifies agreement to the terms of use for the Site. Continued access and use of the Site without acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy relieves Commune from responsibility to the user.

#### Policy Modifications & Contacting Hotel

Commune reserves the right to add to, change, update or modify (“Modification”) this Privacy Policy at any time simply by posting the Modification on the Site and without any other notice to you. Any Modification will be effective immediately upon posting on the Site. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy from time to time to ensure that you continue to agree with all of its terms.

#### Commune Site Security Statement

We want our Site visitors to feel confident about using our Site to plan and purchase their accommodations, so we are committed to protecting the information we collect. All personal information you provide is encrypted and secure. However, even with these security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of Personal Data and Aggregated data, we make no assurances about our ability to prevent any such loss, misuse or alteration.
