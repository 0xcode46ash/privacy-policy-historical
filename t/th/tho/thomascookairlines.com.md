#### Where do we store your personal data and how do we keep your personal data secure?

The personal data collected from you when you make a booking or other purchase via this web site will be transferred to, Thomas Cook Airlines Limited, Airshoppen, Thomas Cook Tour Operations Limited and in some cases to third party airlines/other suppliers, in order to provide you with the services/products you have purchased.   This may require your data to be transferred to, and be processed and/or stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") if the relevant supplier is located outside of the EEA. Countries outside of the EEA may not have the same level of privacy laws as exist in the UK and the rest of the EEA. By making a booking/purchase and submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. All reasonable steps will be taken to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

All information you provide to any Thomas Cook company is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where you have been given (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of this site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. Please do not share your password with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although all reasonable steps are taken to protect your personal data, it is not possible to guarantee the security of your data transmitted to this site and any transmission is at your own risk. Once  your information has been received, strict procedures and security features are used to try to prevent unauthorised access.

#### Who do we share your information with?

When you make a booking via this web site, your personal data will be collected by Thomas Cook Airlines Limited.   Where you book a flight with a third party airline/carrier, your personal data will be passed to Thomas Cook Tour Operations Limited as the party with whom you are contracting and to the third party airline/carrier providing your flight (as applicable). 

If you make a duty free purchase via Airshoppen, you will be providing some personal data to Thomas Cook Airlines Scandinavia A/S to enable that company to fulfil your purchase order. 

Thomas Cook Airlines Limited sometimes needs to sub-contract its services to other airlines, some of which are within the Thomas Cook Group of companies.  In that case, it will be necessary to pass your personal data to the relevant airline on which you will be carried.  This will be either Condor Flugdienst GmbH or Thomas Cook Airlines Belgium NV (companies that are within the Thomas Cook Group) or a third party airline. 

In order for you to travel abroad, it may be mandatory (as required by government authorities at the point of departure and/or destination) to disclose and process your personal data for immigration, border control, security and anti-terrorism purposes, or for any other purposes which they determine appropriate. Some countries will only permit travel if you provide advance passenger information. These requirements may differ dependent on your destination and you are advise to check. Even if not mandatory, we may exercise our discretion to assist where appropriate. 

We may also be required to disclose your personal information to   other relevant third parties (including, but not limited to the police) for the purpose of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

#### Your Rights - Access to your personal data

You have the right to check that your personal data is being processed lawfully ("subject access right"). Your subject access right can be exercised in accordance with the Act. 

Any subject access request must be made in writing to: Group Airlines Data Protection Officer Thomas Cook Airlines Limited, Hangar 1, Western Maintenance Area, Runger Lane, Manchester Airport, M90 5FL, and may be subject to a fee of £10 per subject access request to meet our costs in providing you with details of any personal data we hold about you. We will provide your personal data to you within the statutory timeframes, which are currently within 40 days of receiving your request and the £10 data processing fee. Please note that if your booking is for a third party flight and your contract is with Thomas Cook Tour Operations Limited, your subject access request will be passed to the  UK Compliance Manager of Thomas Cook Tour Operations Limited.   To enable us to trace any of your personal data that we may be holding, we may need to request further information from you, such as a booking reference number, a UK departure date and the names of other passengers on your booking.   Where you require a copy of any of your personal data that is held by a third party airline, it will be necessary for you to make your request directly to the airline concerned.

If you have a complaint about how we have used your information, you have the right to complain to the Information Commissioners Office.
