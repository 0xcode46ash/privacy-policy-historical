**SECURITY:** Any personal data received by us through our Site is protected and encrypted by Secure Socket Layer (SSL). We have taken what we believe to be reasonable steps to ensure your personal data is accessible only to those whom we designate.

It is shared with our independent franchisees who will provide you the car. We also exchange information about our customers with marketing partners with whom you also do business. Once we have accumulated information about you and your traveling profile, we and our marketing partners may use that information to develop marketing and promotion programs tailored for you. To the extent necessary, this information may be passed to third parties to enforce collection efforts against you as a result of the breach of any agreement with us.
