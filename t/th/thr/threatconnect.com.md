# Cyber Squared Inc. Privacy Policy | Cyber Squared

Welcome to Cyber Squared Inc. (“ **Cyber Squared** ”, “ **we** ”, “ **us** ”, or “ **our** ”) and the various Sites operated by us (the “Sites”). We provide our users (collectively, “ **you** ” or “ **your** ”) with resources and information about cyber security,  our products, related services  and white papers, (collectively, the “ **Services** ”).  We know you are concerned about your privacy, so we developed this privacy policy (“ **Privacy Policy** ”) to explain how we collect, use, and disclose information from and/or about you.  Capitalized terms used in the Privacy Policy not defined herein will have the meaning given to them in their appropriate license or terms of service agreement.

YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.  BY USING THESE SITES AND PROVIDING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE TRANSFER OF DATA FROM YOUR COUNTRY TO A COUNTRY THAT HAS LESS STRINGENT LAWS, AND THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IN CONFORMANCE WITH THIS POLICY.

Privacy is of great importance to us whether you are a visitor browsing the Sites or a Registered User. So we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase **“Personal Information”** in this Privacy Policy, we mean contact information (e.g. name, address, email address, or telephone number) and any other non-public information that is used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual. When we use the phrase **“Anonymous Information”** in this Privacy Policy, we mean information that is neither used nor intended to be used to personally identify an individual.

**Children.**

The Sites is not directed to children and children are not eligible to use our Services.  Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us.  We do not collect or maintain Personal Information from people we actually know are under 13 years of age, and no part of our Sites or Services is designed to attract people under 13 years of age. If we later learn that a user is under 13 years of age, we will take steps to remove that user’s Personal Information from our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the Sites and the Services.
