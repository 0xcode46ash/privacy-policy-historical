****Your privacy matters to us**  
** Welcome to Thrift Books.

By using our Web site or purchasing products or services from us, you agree to be bound by this policy. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect and how we use it. Please check back periodically.

**What information we collect and how we use it**   
When you visit our Web site, Thrift Books collects your IP address, which we use to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Web site, and to improve our products and services. Your IP address also is used to gather broad demographic information that does not personally identify you.

To request more information about an item, you must provide your e-mail address so that the seller may reply to your question by e-mail.

To order from us, you must set up a Thrift Books account. Setting up an account requires you to provide your e-mail address and to choose a password (your "Account Information"). When you order from us, we also ask for your name, shipping address, telephone number, and your credit card number, billing address, and expiration date (your "Order Information"). This information is necessary for us to process your order, to notify you of your order status, and to fulfill orders.We do not save your credit card info unless you check the box asking us to.
