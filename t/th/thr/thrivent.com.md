**What information do we gather on our Web site?**  
When you register for Lutherans Online chat rooms and message boards, other free Lutherans Online services, Thrivent Financial Members Only area, or other secured access areas (e.g., account access), we ask that you provide your name, date of birth, e-mail address, and postal address (including city, state, and ZIP code). 

In other sections of our Web site (e.g., the information request form, free offers order forms), we may capture additional information such as telephone number, name of your church, the home city/state of your church, and whether or not you are Lutheran. 

For added security, to register for access to the Account Access or Members Only areas, you will need to provide your Social Security number or Thrivent ID, and contract number or birth date. This information, required at initial registration only, is used to identify you as a unique, authorized user.

**Do we use cookie technology?**  
Cookies are messages given to your Web browser by a Web server. The browser stores the message (e.g., a user ID or password) on your computer in a text file called cookie.txt. The message is then sent back to the server each time your browser requests that site. For security reasons, cookies technology is not available for access to secure areas on Thrivent Financial's Web sites. You need to type your user ID and password every time you log in to a secure access area. 

Cookie technology, however, may be used in various sections of our Web site to provide you with personalized services and increase the quality of your online experiences. 

Cookies cannot be used to reveal your e-mail address obtained from your hard drive or learn confidential or personal information about you that you have not already explicitly revealed.

**Do we use encryption technology?**  
Several areas on Thrivent Financial's Web site (e.g., Account Access) have been built to handle sensitive or confidential information. These pages utilize an Internet method known as Secure Socket Layers (SSL). With SSL engaged, pages are sent to you in an encrypted (scrambled) format and any information you submit to Thrivent Financial also is encrypted. Encryption is the transformation of data into a form unreadable by anyone who doesn't have the appropriate decryption key. This method of transferring sensitive data is considered the industry standard for the Internet. 

For added security, close your browser completely when you finish using this site. While online, your browser is using part of your computer's memory. If your broswer is left open, it may be possible for someone using your computer to go back and use this memory to access your information. By closing your browser, the memory it is using is cleared. You may also want to consider clearing your browser's temporary files. 

For your security, we highly recommend you update your browser to versions that support SSL. Netscape and Microsoft Internet Explorer are two browsers that support these encryption techniques. Netscape will display a solid key graphic in the lower left corner when the SSL mode is engaged and the connection is encrypted. Internet Explorer displays a lock on the icon bar in the lower right corner while encrypted. If you are not sure if your browser is compatible, check with your service provider. 

Thrivent Financial has taken steps to make all information you provide to us as secure as possible against unauthorized access and use, alteration, and/or loss. This information is kept in Thrivent Financial's secure database. You should keep in mind, however, that no data transmission over the Internet is 100 percent secure and any information disclosed online can potentially be intercepted and used by unauthorized parties.

**What is our policy for children (individuals under 13 years of age)?**

No information should be submitted to or posted on our site by children under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. 

Registration will not be accepted if the birth date indicates the individual is under the age of 13.
