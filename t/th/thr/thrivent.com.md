**Do we use cookie technology?**  
Yes, Thrivent Financial's Web site uses cookie technology. Cookies are messages given to your Web browser by a Web server. The browser stores the message on your computer in a text file called cookie.txt. The message is then sent back to the server each time your browser requests that site. When you register for Thrivent Financial Members Only area or Lutherans Online, you can request cookies store your user name and password. By using the cookie, your computer will remember who you are when you try to re-visit that section of the Web site, so you will not need to type your user name and password every time you enter. 

Note: If you use more than one computer, you will have to supply your user name and password when you use a computer other than the one you registered with because the Web server won't be able to identify that computer. 

Cookie technology also may be used in various sections of our Web site to provide you with personalized services and increase the quality of your online experiences. 

Cookies cannot be used to reveal your e-mail address obtained from your hard drive or learn confidential or personal information about you that you have not already explicitly revealed.

**Do we use encryption technology?**  
Several areas on Thrivent Financial's Web site (e.g., Account Access) have been built to handle sensitive or confidential information. These pages utilize an Internet method known as Secure Socket Layers (SSL). With SSL engaged, pages are sent to you in an encrypted (scrambled) format and any information you submit to Thrivent Financial also is encrypted. Encryption is the transformation of data into a form unreadable by anyone who doesn't have the appropriate decryption key. This method of transferring sensitive data is considered the industry standard for the Internet. 

For added security, close your browser completely when you finish using this site. While online, your browser is using part of your computer's memory. If your broswer is left open, it may be possible for someone using your computer to go back and use this memory to access your information. By closing your browser, the memory it is using is cleared. You may also want to consider clearing your browser's temporary files. 

For your security, we highly recommend you update your browser to versions that support SSL. Netscape and Microsoft Internet Explorer are two browsers that support these encryption techniques. Netscape will display a solid key graphic in the lower left corner when the SSL mode is engaged and the connection is encrypted. Internet Explorer displays a lock on the icon bar in the lower right corner while encrypted. If you are not sure if your browser is compatible, check with your service provider. 

Thrivent Financial has taken steps to make all information you provide to us as secure as possible against unauthorized access and use, alteration, and/or loss. This information is kept in Thrivent Financial's secure database. You should keep in mind, however, that no data transmission over the Internet is 100 percent secure and any information disclosed online can potentially be intercepted and used by unauthorized parties.

**What is our policy for children (individuals under 13 years of age)?**  
Your children's safety is important to us! We have developed our privacy guidelines in compliance with the requirements outlined by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). No information should be submitted to or posted on our site by children under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. 

Registration will not be accepted if the birth date indicates the individual is under the age of 13. We recommend parents/guardians of the children register first and then add the children as family members. Be sure the box indicating the member (child) is a minor is checked. 

As part of the Members Only registration process, registrants can elect to have their names added to the Member Directory. If you select this option when adding your children, their names, states of residence, and e-mail addresses are available to other members so they can communicate with each other via e-mail. To select/unselect this option in your children's profiles, go to the Members Only area and change their user profile information. 

We encourage you to participate in your children's online experiences and ask that all children have their parent's or guardian's permission before sharing any personal information on our Web site (or anyone online for that matter).
