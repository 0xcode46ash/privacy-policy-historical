# Disclaimer & Privacy Policy | ThredUp

**Put simply: we will NEVER sell your information to anyone! However, in order to facilitate the sending of items, your mailing address will be shared with the member who’s sending you the item.**

This policy covers how ThredUp treats personal information that ThredUp collects and receives, including information related to your past use of ThredUp products. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that ThredUp does not own or control or to people that ThredUp does not employ or manage.

**Collecting Information**

ThredUp collects personal information when you register with ThredUp, when you use ThredUp products or when you visit ThredUp pages. ThredUp may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. Once you register with ThredUp and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. ThredUp automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, ThredUp cookie information, and the page you request. ThredUp uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.

**Cookies**

ThredUp may set and access ThredUp ‘cookies’ on your computer. ThredUp lets other companies that may show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies’ use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to ThredUp’ cookies.

**Your Information**

You can edit your ThredUp account information at any time. We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the ThredUp service, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the ThredUp Newsletter, that are considered part of your ThredUp account, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them. You can delete your account by contacting ThredUp.

**Confidentiality and Security**

We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.  
Protecting Your Information

ThredUp does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you’ve requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

  * We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with ThredUp under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help ThredUp communicate with you about offers from ThredUp and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;
  * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of ThredUp’ terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
  * We transfer information about you if ThredUp is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, ThredUp will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.



**Policy Updates**

ThredUp may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your ThredUp account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
