# Thrillist : Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy Thrillist will never sell our integrity. Just as importantly, Thrillist will never rent, share, or sell our subscriber list. Not even for really hot sex. We appreciate you letting us into your email, and we promise not to abuse that trust. We make this promise because we understand just how much you value your privacy. The policy below describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit our site and/or register for Thrillist. Please read this carefully. There will not be a test, but it’s still important. 

Your Information We’re not interested in obtaining a list of your past girlfriends, political affiliations, or the shady things you’ve done for money. All we need is your email address. Thrillist doesn’t collect any information except that expressly provided by you. We will not disclose your personal information to any third party without your consent, except as required to provide you with Thrillist material. 

Other Information In order to make our site better, we may also request other information from you. Just generic stuff -- like income level or age, that will help us tailor the site to your needs. We may also share this information with third parties, but only in aggregate, anonymous form. (For example, we might inform an advertiser that, “The average Thrillist subscriber earns $60,000 a year, then blows 2/3rds of it on high end vodka.”) No third party will receive information from us that personally identifies you or anyone else in any way. 

Usage Information It is important for us to gather information on how our site is used: How much time do users spend on our site? What sites did they come from? What sites do they go to once they’ve had just about enough of our smartass attitude? All of this information is collected in aggregate form. None of it is personally identifiable. This information will not make it possible for us to corner the market on, say, frozen concentrated orange juice. It’s collected only to help us to, among other things, handle traffic on Thrillist, and to make sure that our service reaches you in the most efficient manner possible. 

Review and Access If you request it, Thrillist will provide you with a summary of the information we’ve collected about you, and the opportunity to correct, update or modify this information. You don’t even have to ask nicely. 

Third Party Advertising Some of the ads you receive from Thrillist are delivered by third-party advertisers with whom we’ve struck up an alliance. If you visit their site, usage information (like the number of times you’ve viewed an ad) will be collected in order to efficiently serve ads to you. Your personal information will not be collected. To find out more about third-party advertisers’ privacy policies, please log onto their websites. 

Cookies Back in the day, a “cookie” was either something you ate, or a monumentally grating term of endearment. In Internet terminology, cookies are small text files placed on your computer, in order to help websites like ours retrieve information vital to providing the best possible service. Our cookies allow us to recognize you and simplify your user experience. Thrillist will never use cookies to obtain any information from your computer not related to our site. 

Third Party Cookies Our third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Check with those third-parties for a description of their use of cookies. 

Links to Other Sites Thrillist loves using links. Partly because they allow us to guide you towards valuable products and services, and partly because there’s a lot of really weird garbage out there, and exposing you to it is extremely pleasurable. However, we are not responsible for any content that appears on these sites, nor do we endorse them. For questions about these sites, please consult their individual privacy policies. 

Security All of the information described above is recorded on embossed sheets of gold leaf locked in steel vaults thousands of feet beneath the earth’s crust, or on our secure server.

Modifications Thrillist may make changes to this policy in the future. Not wholesale changes, like “Privacy? Forget that noise!” Just modifications. If and when we do, we’ll be sure to inform you here. 

Contact Us If you have questions about this policy, or about the site, please [contact](http://www.thrillist.com/reach-out.html?who=support) us. If you have questions about geopolitics, philosophy, or how to re-socialize after a long stint in prison, try contacting every other available source first. If none of them prove helpful, you can try us, but we won't respond and may contact the authorities.
