## Citi ThankYouÂ® Rewards Online Privacy Statement

This notice discloses the privacy procedures of [www.thankyou.com](https://web.archive.org/). Please read this policy to understand how we will treat the personal information about you.

Our Online Privacy Statement describes how we may collect, use and share information you provide when you visit this website, receive our emails or interact with advertisements we have on third-party websites.

We encourage you to read the privacy policies on these sites:

### 1\. What Information Do We Collect?

We collect two types of online information: non-personal and personal.

**Non-Personal Information**

When you visit our site, we collect the IP Address of the device you use to connect to the Internet. In addition, we gather information such as what browser and which version of it you're using, the type of operating system you have, and which site you came from. This information helps us provide an online experience that matches your device.

When you browse our site or receive one of our emails, we use cookies and/or pixel tags to collect information and store your online preferences. Cookies are widely used and most browsers are set up to accept them automatically. If you would prefer, you can choose to not accept cookies.

It's important to note that cookies and pixel tags do not capture any information that can personally identify you. The information they gather helps us to improve your online experience and may include:

  * Your response to one of our emails
  * Time and duration of your visit to our site
  * Pages you viewed while on our site



We may also supplement the information we collect with information we receive from other companies. For example, we may use marketing segments developed by us or other companies to customize certain services to your local area and provide relevant offers tailored to you.

**Personal Information**

You can visit and browse this site to find out about our program, Sponsors and rewards without giving us any information about yourself. When you enroll in ThankYou Rewards and set up your user name and password, we collect personally identifiable information about you as follows:

  * **Setting Up Your Account:** In order to redeem your ThankYou Points for rewards, you must set up a user name and password, either online or by calling the ThankYou Service Center. This process requires certain personally identifiable information including: your name, postal address, email address, telephone number, and a unique individual password, which we can use to verify your identity. You may also choose to provide us with information about your interests and ThankYou reward preferences.
  * **Transactions & Activities:** If you set up a user name and password and redeem for rewards, we will collect information about your transactions with us. This information includes areas of the website that you visit, redemption history, account activity, and shipping and billing information. We may also receive information about you, such as your earning activity from ThankYou Sponsors.

ThankYou Members may review and change contact information such as address, phone and email information by signing on and updating their personal profile.




### 2\. How Do We Use the Information We Collect?

Citi uses the information we collect about and from you to manage our business and to offer an enhanced, personalized online experience on our site and third-party websites.

The information we collect allows us to:

  * Recognize you when you return to our site so we can personalize your experience
  * Process applications and transactions
  * Respond to your requests
  * Provide you relevant product and service offers on our site and in other advertising



### 3\. How Do We Use Information from Our Advertisements on Other Websites?

Companies we work with place and track advertisements on third-party websites.

Like most advertisers, we place advertisements where we think they will be most relevant to customers. We place advertisements by developing and using our own marketing segments that may combine online and offline information about our current and prospective customers. In addition, we may use marketing segments provided by online publishers and network advertising companies.

Network advertising companies that provide these services have their own privacy policies and are not subject to our Online Privacy Statement. Many of these companies provide ways to avoid targeted advertising provided by, or thru, them.

### 4\. Can You Control Your Information That's Collected and Used Online?

It's important to note that the information we use about you helps us provide you with products, services and experiences that benefit you. You have the ability to control how your non-personal information is collected and used online.

**Cookies**

You can control whether to accept cookies or not.

If you decide to not accept cookies, some features and services on our site may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your ThankYou Account. In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.

If you would prefer not to accept cookies, you can:

  * Change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it
  * Set your browser to automatically not accept any cookies



If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt out of some network advertising programs that use your information. To do so please visit the [NAI Opt-Out Page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt out), you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online. However the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests.

Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. The NAI Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies

### EXTERNAL LINKS

While we try to link only to websites that we believe share our respect for privacy, please be aware that ThankYou Rewards is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other websites. Websites that are accessible by hyperlinks from the ThankYou Rewards website may use cookies.

Companies can create marketing segments by using technologies like IP addresses to compile, over time, aggregated, non-personal information about how consumers are using the Internet. They consider where users saw and/or clicked on content and advertisements, and use this information to make inferences and predictions about the users' characteristics, interests and preferences. This information does not identify you personally nor does it report on particular online activities or behaviors.
