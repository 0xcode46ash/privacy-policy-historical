**The Information We Collect**

If you order a dessert or other product through our site, we will ask you to provide certain personal information, such as your name, email address, postal address and telephone number, as well as credit card information.  We also will ask you to provide name, postal address and other information about the gift recipient to whom you want your order shipped.  As a convenience to you, our site may from time to time include an “address book” feature that simplifies the ordering process by providing you with easy access to your gift recipients’ names, addresses and other information.  You will always know when we are collecting any of the foregoing information about you or your gift recipients (collectively, the “Information”) because we only collect the Information when you voluntarily provide it to us through our site.

**How We Use And Share The Information**

We use the Information to process and fill your orders and to help us improve our site and products.  We also may send you and your gift recipients information about products offered by us and our affiliated companies and may share Information with our affiliated companies for this purpose.  Also, we may share Information with other companies as described below.

·         We may from time to time share Information with other companies who may provide you and your gift recipients information about the products and services they offer.

·         We and our affiliated companies may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.  Examples may include processing credit card payments, delivering any products you may order, providing marketing assistance, and providing customer service. These other companies will have access to the Information only as necessary to perform their functions and to the extent permitted by law. 

  * If we or any of our affiliated companies (or all or substantially all of our assets or the assets of any of our affiliated companies) are acquired, we expect that the Information would be transferred along with the other business assets. 
  * To the extent permitted by law, we may also disclose Information when required by law, court order, or other government or law enforcement authority or regulatory agency, or whenever we believe that disclosing the Information is necessary or advisable, for example, to protect the rights, property, or safety of 800 Brands, Inc. or others.  This may include, for example, sharing information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.



**How We Protect Your Information**

While we strive to maintain reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to secure the Information from unauthorized access, we are unable to guarantee that security measures we take will not be penetrated or compromised or that the Information will remain secure under all circumstances. 

**Changes to Our Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date stated at the top of this policy.  We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post any changes on our web site as soon as they go into effect.  Please be aware that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, our use of Information is governed by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time we use the Information.  Please refer back to this Privacy Policy on a regular basis.
