The City of Melbourne views the protection of your privacy as an integral part of its commitment towards complete accountability and integrity in all its activities and programs.

The City of Melbourne operates this website under the domain name [www.thatsmelbourne.com.au](https://web.archive.org/).  The purpose of this Website Privacy Statement is to explain how your personal information (being information capable of identifying you as an individual) will be treated as you access and interact with this website.

####

Cookies

  
A Cookie is a block of data that is shared between a web server and a user’s browser.  Cookies give the server information about a user’s identify (or, at least, the computer’s ID, or the client’s ID), even if he or she is not the person actually using the computer at the time.  
Cookies are used on this site, but they do not collect any personal information.  For the most part they are sessional and just contain system-generated values to identify the user's session.  This website uses two persistent cookies: 

(1) to store the user's preference for viewing the web site in the regular or larger font size; 

(2) to store the user's "itinerary", a list of businesses and events they wish to attend. 

Neither cookie will store personal or identifying information the user.  


#### Web Beacons

  
Web beacons (also known as web bugs) are images, often embedded in code, that originate from a third party site to track visitor activities.  The image is placed on many or all pages and is generally invisible to visitors, who are not able to view the underpinning code.

The City of Melbourne does not use web beacons.

#### Clickstream Data

  
Clickstream data refers to visitor logs and statistics that provide useful information about users’ online experience without identifying individuals.  We collect the following clickstream data for statistical and system administration purposes: 

  * the time/date the page was accessed;
  * the user's external IP address;
  * the user name (but as the web site is configured for anonymous access, this is always blank);
  * the user's browser and version;
  * the user's operating system, the address of each page on our site the user visits; and
  * the address of the last page the user visited.



To the extent that any clickstream data could make you identifiable, we will not attempt to identify you from the clickstream data unless required by law or to investigate improper activity in relation to this website.

####   
Disclosure of Personal Information

  
The City of Melbourne will take all necessary measures to prevent unauthorised access to or disclosure of your personal information.

External organisations to whom personal information is disclosed include Council’s service providers who perform various services for and on behalf of the Council.  These contractors have agreed to be bound by the provisions of the _Victorian Information Privacy Act 2000_.

The City of Melbourne will not disclose your personal information to other agencies and authorities unless required or authorised by law.  We will not sell your details to another company, nor will we add your details to a mailing list without your consent.
