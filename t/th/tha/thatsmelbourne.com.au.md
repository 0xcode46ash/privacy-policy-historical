**Cookies**

A Cookie is a block of data that is shared between a web server and a user's browser. Cookies give the server information about a user’s identify (or, at least, the computer’s ID, or the client’s ID), even if he or she is not the person actually using the computer at the time.

This website uses two persistent cookies: 

  1. to store the user's preference for viewing the web site in the regular or larger font size; 
  2. to store the user's "itinerary", a list of businesses and events they wish to attend. 



Neither cookie will store personal or identifying information the user.

**Web beacons  
**  
Web beacons (also known as web bugs) are images, often embedded in code, that originate from a third party site to track visitor activities. The image is placed on many or all pages and is generally invisible to visitors, who are not able to view the underpinning code. 

The City of Melbourne does not use web beacons.

**Clickstream data

  * the time/date the page was accessed
  * the user's external IP address
  * the user name (but as the web site is configured for anonymous access, this is always blank)
  * the user's browser and version
  * the user's operating system, the address of each page on our site the user visits
  * the address of the last page the user visited.



To the extent that any clickstream data could make you identifiable, we will not attempt to identify you from the clickstream data unless required by law or to investigate improper activity in relation to this website.
