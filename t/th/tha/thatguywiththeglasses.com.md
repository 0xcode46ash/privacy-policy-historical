We'll we did make the finals, but we decided to switch gears. There is a show that should not win that is winning.. Internet Killed Television. There is no point in having our fans and the AVGN fans split their votes. So basically what I'm getting at is in order for one of us to win we need to combine forces. So please **VOTE FOR James (AVGN)** as the best Online Video Web Series!!. Make sure you are logged into Twitter or Facebook as they are required to vote!

Vote the AVGN for the best Online Show.
