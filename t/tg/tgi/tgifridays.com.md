# Privacy Policy | TGI Fridays

At Fridays, we want to make your online and mobile experiences satisfying and safe. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to provide you with the means to control your privacy and give you a way to voice questions or concerns you may have. This website (“Site”) and mobile application (“mobile application” or “app”) are owned, operated and provided to you by TGI Friday’s, Inc (“Fridays,” “us,” or “we”). By using this Site or app, or signing up for Fridays Rewards™ (formerly known as Give Me More Stripes®) Loyalty Program (“Fridays Rewards”), you acknowledge that you understand and agree to the terms of this privacy policy (“Policy”).

## WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

  1. ### **General Browsing Information**

We collect general, non-personal information about visitors to our Site and users of our app, such as the domain type, browser version, service provider, and device type (for mobile) used to access our Site or app. Like many other commercial websites, our Site may employ a standard technology called a “cookie” to collect information about how our Site is used and to remember visitors. This information also provides us information about the technical stability of our Site, app and Fridays Rewards™ program. For those guests that access our in-store Wi-Fi, we will have access to such guests’ device ID and name, if available.

When you log in to our mobile application, you will be asked whether you want the mobile application to remember you. If you choose yes, the mobile application will remain logged in to your information. At any time you can choose to log out by choosing the logout button on the application.

  2. ### **Personal Information**

We only collect personal information from you when you voluntarily submit such information on our Site or when using our app. We use this information for the specific purpose for which it was provided, such as registering for Fridays Rewards, entering a contest, participating in a survey, finding a Fridays™ location, making a reservation, ordering online (where applicable) and other purposes described in this Policy.

  3. ### **FRIDAYS REWARDS™**

Guests that join Fridays Rewards will be asked to provide their email address and phone number. We require your email address to communicate with you about earned rewards, program benefits, program changes, and all promotions and offers available to members. If you no longer wish to receive these email communications, you will forfeit the ability to earn and use Fridays Rewards credits that you have earned.

You have the ability to access and edit the personal information that you have provided to Fridays Rewards. To update your information or to cancel your account, please visit [www.tgifridays.com/rewards](http://www.tgifridays.com/rewards).

If you join Fridays Rewards via the mobile application or log in to your Fridays Rewards account on the mobile application, you will be asked whether you want the mobile application to remember you. If you choose yes, the mobile application will remain logged in to your account. You may be prompted to log in again to access certain functions on the mobile application, such as requesting rewards or paying for online placed orders. At any time you can choose to log out of your account by choosing the logout button on the application. Guests that use our app to order and pay online will, for security purposes, be automatically logged out after a certain period of non-use.

We allow our customers to opt in for text messaging from Fridays during the Fridays Rewards enrollment process. Please review the following steps and terms associated with text messaging:

#### HOW WE USE COLLECTED PERSONAL INFORMATION

We use the information we collect from you for the following purposes:

  * to perform the task or transaction that you request;
  * to understand your preferences and history using our Site, mobile application, Fridays Rewards and related services;
  * to design initiatives to meet those preferences;

If you provide contact information to us, such as a postal or e-mail address, we may use this information to contact you with information about us and our special offers. You can opt-out of receiving these communications from us at any time by following instructions in the communication or contacting us using the information below.

### INFORMATION WE DISTRIBUTE OR MAKE ACCESSIBLE TO THIRD PARTIES

We will not provide access to your information other than as described in this Policy.

The information that you provide is collected by Fridays. In the case of links to our gift card and guest recognition sites, the information you voluntarily provide at those sites will only be shared with those service vendors who help Fridays administer those websites or mobile application and the services they provide. In any case, these vendors may use the information only for the purpose of administering the digital or mobile application and its services for Fridays, and are contractually required to protect the information.

We will not sell or share information about you other than as described in this Policy. We may share your personal and non-personal information or preferences with trusted third parties to operate and improve, or provide any service requested by you, on our digital or mobile application.

We may develop and share summary reports for our advertising partners and agencies that contain non-personal aggregate raw numbers or statistics (which means such information will not tell them who it was that stated a preference or clicked an option).

We may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide personally identifiable information to the appropriate governmental authorities. If requested as part of a legal proceeding, we will provide this information upon receipt of and accordance with appropriate documentation.

There may be links that will let you leave our digital or mobile application, such as when purchasing a Fridays™ gift card. Except for websites directly related to Fridays programs and services, we cannot control the links or their websites and we are not responsible for the contents of any linked website or any link contained in a linked website. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement of the website. The use and/or privacy provided by a linked website as to any information you provide in accessing that website is in no way subject to our privacy policy. Any linked website may have its own policy that could differ considerably from our policy, or the linked website may not display any privacy policy at all. In any case, even though a linked website is accessed through our website, we cannot be responsible for any use that a linked website may make of your information.

From time to time, we may conduct promotions and giveaways on or through the Site and app. As part of registering for those giveaways, you may be asked whether you’d like to receive notifications via email and/or text message to your mobile device. If you agree to those communications, you may receive emails and/or text messages regarding that promotion or giveaway, and text messages may be subject to text message and data rates. 

## A NOTE REGARDING INTERNATIONAL USERS

This Site and app are operated in the United States. If you access the Site or use the app outside of the United States, you understand and agree that all information that you provide and that we collect will be collected, processed, stored and maintained in the United States and protected as noted in this Policy. 

## A NOTE REGARDING BUSINESS TRANSFERS

In the unlikely event that Fridays is bought, sold, files for bankruptcy or otherwise dissolves, all personal and non-personal information collected from and about users shall be considered assets of Fridays, and as such, may be transferred or sold, in whole or part to one or more other companies as part of that transaction.

## A NOTE REGARDING CHILDREN

Like you, we have children of our own and are concerned about their safety when they use the Internet. We want you and your family to be safe while visiting our website. Our Site and app are not designed for or directed to and we do not offer any program participation to children under the age of 13 and will never knowingly request, collect or allow children under this age to provide information about themselves or others on the Site or app. For more information about protecting the privacy and safety of minors online, we recommend you visit <http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/childrens.html>.

## A NOTE REGARDING SECURITY

We operate secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our customers. Any particularly sensitive information, such as a customer’s credit card number, is encrypted prior to transmission. To the extent that administration of the program requires us to grant our Service Vendors access to customer information, we insist that they implement similar controls.

If you have any questions or concerns with this Policy or Fridays’ privacy practices, or wish to opt-out of receiving promotional messages from us, please contact us at <http://www.tgifridays.com/contact>.
