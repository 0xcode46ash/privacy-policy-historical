> CRW encourages kids to consult with their parents before furnishing information to our website. CRW believes that parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing online their name, address and other personal information without parental permission. For additional information about parental control tools, please consult the "Consumer Assistance" page of the Direct Marketing Association home page at [http://www.the-dma.org](http://www.the-dma.org/).
