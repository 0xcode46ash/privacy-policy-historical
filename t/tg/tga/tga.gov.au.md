## Privacy information

The TGA collects a variety of personal information in the course of performing its functions.

Personal information is defined in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Privacy Act). Your personal information is protected by law under the Privacy Act, which contains Australian Privacy Principles. For more information, see the [Office of the Australian Information Commissioner website](http://www.oaic.gov.au/news-and-events/news/privacy-news "link to the OAIC website").

The TGA is part of the Australian Government Department of Health.

The [Department of Health's Privacy Policy](http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/privacy-policy "link to the Health website") contains information about:

  * How you may access your personal information and seek correction of it.
  * How you can complain about a breach of the Australian Privacy Principles and how the Department will deal with that complaint.



In particular, the TGA collects personal information in relation to its key functions of approving therapeutic goods for supply in Australia and licensing Australian manufacturers of therapeutic goods. The TGA uses personal information for these functions, including the following:

### Personal information in applications relating to placing goods in the ARTG or entries in the ARTG

  * The TGA collects personal information in applications to place therapeutic goods in the [Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods](https://web.archive.org/industry/artg.htm), and in associated and ancillary applications in relation to Registration of therapeutic goods (for example to vary entries for goods already in the Register, for a proposed name for a chemical substance, for a conformity assessment certificate for medical devices).
  * The personal information is used to maintain a record of these applications, to consider the applications, and to contact applicants about their application(s).
  * Personal information provided in applications may also be used to contact sponsors of goods in the Register where there is a need to do so - for example, in the event of a safety, quality or efficacy issue concerning the goods, or to administer fees and payments relating to the goods.
  * Personal information relating to sponsors of therapeutic goods may be disclosed where authorised or required by an Australian law, Court or Tribunal order; or with the consent of the person the information is about.
  * Manufacturing licences.



### Personal information in applications relating to manufacturing licences

  * The TGA collects personal information in applications for Australian manufacturing licences, and associated applications such as to vary existing manufacturing licences.
  * The personal information is used to maintain a record of manufacturing licence applications, to consider applications, and to contact applicants about their application.
  * Personal information provided in applications may also be used to contact sponsors or manufacturers of goods in the Register where there is a need to do so - for example, in the event of a safety, quality or efficacy issue concerning the manufacture of certain goods, or to administer fees and payments relating to the licence.
  * Personal information relating to holders of licences to manufacture therapeutic goods may be disclosed where authorised or required by an Australian law, Court or Tribunal order; or with the consent of the person the information is about.



### Other information

Other information about how the TGA uses personal information for its other functions is available on the parts of the TGA website that refer to those functions, or on specific forms that collect the information.
