How Secure Is My Online Transaction Secure?  
  
It is very secure. We use highly sophisticated technology to ensure that your shopping experience will be safe and secure. We encrypt your personal information, including your name, address, and credit card number when transmitting over the Internet using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) security software. We constantly update our security procedures and enhance our site to meet the very latest encryption standards. We retain a third party security firm to audit our procedures to ensure compliance with these standards. All of your sensitive information is scrambled before, during and after your order is placed on our site.

You may notice an unbroken key  or a closed lock  at the bottom of the page when you enter our "check-out" page. This means that your browser has opened a secure connection with our site! You can also check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https."

**PLEASE NOTE THAT NORMAL EMAIL (SUCH AS USING CONTACT US OR YOUR HOME EMAIL) IS NOT ENCRYPTED AND THUS IS NOT A SECURE MEANS FOR TRANSMITTING CREDIT CARD INFORMATION OR ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU WISH TO KEEP PRIVATE AND SECURE.**

Does Redcats USA Use Cookies?  
  
Yes. Redcats USA uses cookies to enhance the browsing and shopping experience on the Redcats USA family of brands’ websites. Cookies are small files or records that we place on your computer’s hard drive to collect information about your activities on the Redcats USA sites. There are absolutely no personally identifiable pieces of information stored anywhere in these files, and they are used solely by Redcats USA to enhance your shopping experience and to allow us to serve you better in the future. These cookies transmit information back to the computers at Redcats USA’s family of brands; these computers are, generally speaking, the only computers which are authorized to read such information. The information captured makes it possible for us (i) to speed navigation, keep track of items in your shopping cart, and provide you with custom tailored content; (ii) to remember information you gave to us so you don’t have to reenter it each time you visit the Redcats USA sites; (iii) to monitor the effectiveness of some of our marketing email campaigns; and (iv) to monitor total number of visitors, pages viewed, and the total number of visitors served.

The Golf Warehouse uses Omniture and other service providers to help gather and analyze information about our customers (anonymous traffic, and from time to time, individual user activity) on our website. These service providers’ only role is to help us conduct our business and deliver the most relevant products and services. They are not permitted to use your personally indentifiable information for any secondary purpose.

Most people do not even know that cookies are being placed on their computers when they visit the Redcats USA family of brands’ sites or most other websites because web browsers are typically set to accept cookies. You can choose to have your browser warn you every time a cookie is being sent to you or you can turn off cookie acceptance altogether. However, if you refuse cookies, you will be unable to order from the Redcats USA sites using the Shopping Cart. You will still be able to browse our selection, but the order process requires that your Web Browser be set to allow cookies. Moreover, by not allowing cookies, your overall Internet browsing experience could be adversely affected.
