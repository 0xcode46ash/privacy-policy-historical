**What personal information is being gathered by Travelocity.com and how is this information being used?**

_Member Registration_  
When you become a Travelocity.com member you provide your name, address, telephone number, email address, a unique login name, password, and password validation. This information is collected on the registration form for several reasons including: (i) personal identification; (ii) to complete air, car, and hotel reservations; (iii) to allow us to contact you for customer service, if necessary; (iv) to customize the content of our site to meet your specific needs; and (v) to make product improvements to Travelocity.com. In addition, your email address is collected to send you an email message confirming your new member registration and each reservation you transact online. As a member you will occasionally receive updates from us about fare sales in your area, special offers, new Travelocity.com services, and other noteworthy news items. However, you may always decline to receive these email messages. Please see our 

_Opt Out_ policy described below.

_Member Profile_  
Members can choose to provide Travelocity.com with travel preferences, credit card billing information, ticket delivery address, travel agency preference and other personal information. This information is primarily used to assist members in making reservations quickly without having to type in the same information repeatedly. For example, members can store their airline frequent flyer numbers so that when a reservation is made on that airline, Travelocity.com automatically pre-fills the frequent flyer number input box.

_Newsletter and Fare Watcher Email_  
Travelocity.com's newsletter, "Traveler's Check" and Fare Watcher Email are optional benefits for members that keep you up to date with the latest travel news and low airfares. Your specific email address and type of email (html or text) are needed to subscribe to Traveler's Check. Fare Watcher Email tracks the prices of airline tickets to your favorite places. When the price for one of your favorite trips changes by $25, Travelocity.com will notify you of the change via email. Your email address and preferred round trip city pairs are necessary to receive Fare Watcher Emails. 

_Flight Paging_  
Travelocity.com's Flight Paging feature allows members to receive updated flight information such as departure time and gate through a pager. To receive these messages, Travelocity.com will collect your pager name, pin number, airline, and flight numbers.

_Contests_  
Travelocity.com frequently sponsors contests to give members the opportunity to win great travel prizes. Information collected by Travelocity.com for such contests can include contact information and survey questions. Contact information is used to notify contest winners and survey information is used to develop promotions and product improvements to Travelocity.

_Online Surveys_  
Travelocity.com values opinions and comments from members, so we frequently conduct online surveys. These surveys are entirely optional for all members. Typically, the information is aggregated and used to make improvements to Travelocity.com and to develop appealing content, features and promotions for members. Survey participants are anonymous unless otherwise stated in the survey.
