## Privacy

For 'Transum Trophies' you are invited to enter your email address as a unique identifier. Email addresses entered will not be used for any other purpose. An alternative option of choosing a Transum username is also available.

## COPPA

The US Congress enacted the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in 1998 and Transum complies by not collecting personal information from children using this site. In particular one feature of the Transum website is allowing users to claim virttual trophies for activities they complete. In order to record which trophies a person has been awarded we ask for a username (but no other information) which could be a made up unique name or an email address. For children under 13 this qualifies as an exception to obtaining prior parental consent as described in the frequently asked questions at http://business.ftc.gov/documents/Complying-with-COPPA-Frequently-Asked-Questions which states that websites may collect a child's email address to be used to authenticate the child if the website does not collect any personal information from the child other than the child's email address and the child cannot disclose any personal information on the website and the email address is altered and not used to contact the child.
