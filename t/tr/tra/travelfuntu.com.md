## Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy

We have developed a privacy policy to keep you informed of what personally identifiable information ("PII") we may collect from you, what this information will be used for, with whom such information will be shared, and the security procedures we have implemented to protect your privacy. PII includes information that can be linked to a specific individual, such as name, address, phone number or email address

Security of Your Personal Information

We recognize the importance of security for all PII associated with our customers and use reasonable measures consistent with industry practices to protect PII under our control. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we will use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. In order to protect the information stored in our systems, we have implemented security measures, including data encryption technology and firewalls.

Third-Party Links

The Web site may contain links to web sites operated and maintained by third parties over whom we have no control. The information practices of those Web sites are not covered by this privacy policy. Any information you provide to third-party Web sites or that we provide in relation to travel reservations you made will be governed under the terms of each such Web site's privacy policy. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are entering another Web site, and we have no responsibility or liability whatsoever for the content, actions, or policies of such third-party Web sites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of all third-party Web sites that link to the Web site, because such privacy policies may be materially different from this privacy policy.
