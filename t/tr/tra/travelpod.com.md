# TravelPod - Privacy Statement

**Email Addresses Stored on TravelPod**

A valid concern raised by TravelPod users is "What does TravelPod do with the email addresses I put on the site?". A valid concern indeed. 

There are 2 sets of email addresses which TravelPod stores, member addresses and addresses on TravelPod member notification lists ( Address Books ). 

The email address of the member ( if the member choses to provide it to TravelPod ) is used to send the member warnings, alerts, information about their travelogue and it's usage. Generally speaking, the emails sent to the user are for the user's benefit ( ie: TravelPod will send a member an email if a user unsubscribes from their travelogue ) and it's highly recommended that members provide their address to TravelPod to fully enjoy the features of the web site.

Aside from internal usage, the email address is never provided to any external parties for any purpose and is considered strictly confidential.

The other set of email addresses stored on TravelPod are the notification emails addresses. These addresses are stored on TravelPod in a member's address book which can later be used to email a notification of an update to their travelogue. These addresses are never released outside of TravelPod nor are they ever used for marketing purposes of ANY kind. TravelPod members can be at be assured that the confidentiality of the addresses on their lists is strictly enforced.

**Bottom line:** Any addresses provided to TravelPod, stay within TravelPod and are **NEVER** used for any non-ethical purposes nor is it ever provided to any external parties.
