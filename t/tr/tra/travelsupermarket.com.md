**The information we collect**

We collect personal information about you when you give this to us in the course of registering for and using our Services, for example, in order to obtain comparative quotes for car insurance.  In the course of providing the Services to you, we may also store information about how you use our website, for example the pages viewed, the website from which you came to visit our website, changes you make to information you supply to us, details of the quotes you request and your transactions, together with details of your financial information  for example bank account or payment details.  We will periodically review your personal information to ensure that we do not keep it for longer than is permitted by law.

We may also need to collect information from you about other individuals, e.g. additional named drivers if you request a car insurance quotation. As explained in our Terms of Use, by submitting another person's details you are confirming to us that you have their permission to do so and that they understand how their details will be used.

**Purposes for which we use information about you**

We may use your personal information for the following purposes:

For further information about these third parties, please contact us at [DPO@moneysupermarket.com](mailto:DPO@moneysupermarket.com).  When they prepare quotations and use your data for market analysis, these companies will be acting as data controllers of your information and therefore you should view their privacy policies or contact them directly for further information;

Sensitive information, for example, your credit card details, is encrypted to minimise the risk of interception during transit.  However, whilst we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information which you send to us, and you do so at your own risk. The Terms of Use also explains your obligation to keep secure any username and password which you create when registering for the Services.

You have certain rights under the Data Protection Act 1998. For example, we will always let you have a copy of all personal information we have about you, if you request it from us in writing. The law allows us to charge you a £10 fee for a copy of such information and we may do so.
