 **The information we collect  
**  
We collect personal information about you when you give this to us in the course of registering for and/or using our Services, for example, in order to obtain comparative quotes for car insurance or when taking part in our online discussion forums.  In the course of providing the Services to you, we may also store information about how you use our Website, for example, the pages viewed, the website from which you came to visit our Website, changes you make to information you supply to us, details of the quotes you request and your transactions, together with details of your financial information,  for example, bank account or payment details.

  Telephone calls that you make to our customer services help line on 0845 345 5708 may be monitored and/or recorded. This will help us to train our staff and improve our service to you.

We will periodically review your personal information to ensure that we do not keep it for longer than is permitted by law.

 **Purposes for which we use information about you  
**  
We and other members of the Moneysupermarket Group may use your personal information for the following purposes:

  1. to enable you to access and use the Services; and/or 
  2. to personalise and improve aspects of our overall service to you and our other users, as well as carrying out research such as analysing market trends and customer demographics; and/or 
  3. to communicate with you, including sending you information about products and services which we think may be of interest to you, and sending you annual insurance renewal quotes based on information you previously provided to us if you have requested insurance quotes; and/or 
  4. to process a transaction between you and a third party.



**Passing on information about you** As part of using our Services you consent to us disclosing your personal information to the following parties:

  1. Third parties, including but not limited to companies whose products or services are included on our website with a view to providing you with an online quotation for the product and/or service requested by you.  When these companies use your data in this way, they will be acting as data controllers of your information and therefore you should view their privacy policies or contact them directly for further information. For further information about these third parties, please contact us at [DPO@moneysupermarket.com](mailto:DPO@moneysupermarket.com). Some third parties with which we share your information may use it to carry out research such as analysis of market trends and customer demographics and to customise and develop the product/service which they offer to you or other individuals in the future. 
  2. The Financial Services Authority and/or other regulatory/governing bodies for the purposes of compliance monitoring; 
  3. Selected other third parties whose products, services or other offers we believe may interest you (see our section on **Keeping you informed about offers and services** below); 
  4. If you use our Services to search for and compare insurance products, the information you provide may be used to carry out certain credit checks through licensed credit-referencing agencies. This is used as part of the underwriting process for some of the insurance providers and a record of this search will be made although this will not adversely affect your credit profile.



Where permitted by data protection and privacy law, we may also disclose information about you, or access your account:

  1. if required or permitted to do so by law; and/or 
  2. if required to do so by any court, the Financial Services Authority, the Office of Fair Trading or any other applicable regulatory, compliance, Governmental or law enforcement agency; and/or 
  3. if necessary in connection with legal proceedings or potential legal proceedings; and/or 
  4. in connection with the sale or potential sale of all or part of our business or the company.



If we reasonably believe false or inaccurate information has been provided and fraud is suspected, details may be passed to fraud prevention agencies to prevent fraud and money laundering.

 **Keeping you informed of offers and services** You agree that we and other trusted third parties shall be entitled to advise you via e-mail, post, telephone or by text of products, services and other offers we think may interest you. For example, we may e-mail you letting you know how you could save money by changing products and services.

Whenever you provide us with personal information, we will give you an opportunity to tell us you do not consent to us and others using and sharing your information for marketing purposes. Unless you tell us otherwise, you are consenting to such uses.

For example, in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 we will always let you have a copy of the personal information we have about you, if you request it from us in writing. The law allows us to charge you a £10 fee for a copy of such information and we may do so. 

**Your responsibility for the information you provide** You may complete a registration process as part of your use of this Website which may include the creation of a username, password and/or other identification information. Any username, password and/or other identification information must be kept confidential by you and must not be disclosed to, or shared with, anyone.

We may also need to collect information from you about other individuals, e.g. additional named drivers if you request a car insurance quotation. As explained in our Terms of Use, by submitting another person's details you are confirming to us that you have their permission to do so and that they understand how their details will be used.
