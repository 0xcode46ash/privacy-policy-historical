Information relating to the translation, the nature of the translation and any information the Customer transmits to Translated shall be treated with complete confidentiality. Translated shall not publicly divulge in any way this information without previous written authorization from the customer, with the exception of collaborators or subcontractors previously authorized by Translated and the Customer who require such information to perform their jobs. 

These guarantees shall not be applicable in the event that Translated is required by law to communicate such information, or in the event that such information becomes public domain, independently of divulgement of such information by Translated.

## Automatically Collected Information

We use your IP address (the one that unequivocally identifies the host at that particular time) and cookies to identify you while you make purchases on our site.  
Translated uses a form to acquire information related to an order. In addition to the full name of the person placing the order, information for billing and future contacts is also registered. Translated is not given information related to credit cards - they are instead directly managed on Banca Sella's secure credit card processing server. 

## Newsletter & emails

We send you emails for a variety of reasons. These may include confirmations of orders or registrations. Our communication may also include information about our services, provided you have not revoked your consent for such usage, which you can of course do at any time at [http://www.translated.net](http://www.translated.net/) or by writing to [info@translated.net](mailto:info@translated.net). 

Any emails we send are saved by us and any emails that may be regarded as business letters will not be deleted during the statutory retention period. Furthermore, in the case of our newsletter emails, we record (e.g. by means of a so-called “tracking pixel”) whether an email is opened and which links in the email are clicked on; we do so to optimize our offers and tailor their design to meet your needs. We use this data to enable us to send newsletter contents that matches your profile. 

If you wish to object to this use of your data, you can do so by unsubscribing to our newsletters. We also use service providers from the USA to send our emails. We make sure that the statutory conditions for the cross-border use of personal details are fulfilled. 

## Supplier and Collaborator Privacy

The personal information of our suppliers and freelance collaborators (suppliers, translators, interpreters, graphic designers, affiliates, consultants etc.) are processed with utmost confidentiality. The only information which is provided to third parties is the information published on our site: your username, your native language, experience and educational background. Other information including full name, date of birth, addresses and telephone numbers are only used by Translated and its authorized suppliers (e.g. accounting firms, banks, etc.) for purposes related to current jobs. 

## Right to Change or Delete Information

Users may change their information or ask for their information to be deleted at any time, as stipulated by Italian law regarding Privacy - no. 675/96 dated 31.12.1996.

## Navigation data and cookies

### Navigation data

The computer systems and programs used for the website's operation collect some personal data whose transmission is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols (e.g. IP addresses or domain names of computers used by users who connect to the site, URI [Uniform Resource Identifiers] of resources requested, the time of request, method used to submit the request to the server, file size obtained in response, numerical code for the status of the response submitted by the server - successful, error, etc., and other parameters relating to the user's operating system and computer environment). Although this sort of information is not collected to be associated with identified users, through processing and in association with data held by third parties, it could by its very nature allow for users to be identified.

These data types are used solely to obtain statistical information pertaining to the website's usage and serve to check the site's correct operation; they are thus not associated with any given user ID and are deleted immediately after processing.
