# Privacy Policy

**Trail's End Company Internet Technologies Privacy Policy**

The policies below are applicable to the above-named online service (the "Service") produced and maintained by Trail's End Company. 

TEC-IT collects personally identifying information only during (i) contest or sweepstakes Registration and (ii) user Registration for sites that require subscription and (iii) online shopping. . In addition, Registration is required and information is collected in certain portions of the Service in which guests specifically and knowingly provide such information along with content submissions, community postings (i.e., chat or bulletin boards), suggestions, or voting. TEC-IT may use such information to fulfill prizes, track compliance with our House Rules, or for editorial and feedback purposes (to the extent that is explained when guests provide the information). In the event TEC-IT plans to publicly post any such information on a site, guests are provided prior notification of such posting and given the option of preventing such posting. 

TEC-IT encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the interactive activities offered on the site. 

No information should be submitted to or posted to public areas at Trails-End.com by guests under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, TEC-IT does not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any other third party than the BSA for any purpose whatsoever. All registrants receive e-mail confirming their Registration. In addition, when a guest under 13 registers, his/her parent or guardian receives an e-mail alerting them to that Registration and providing instructions on how the parent could delete the Registration if so desired.  No information collected from guests under 13 years of age is used for any marketing or promotional purpose whatsoever outside TEC-IT. Guests' e-mail addresses are never publicly posted on TEC-IT sites. To facilitate global registration within sites operated by TEC-IT, all Registration information is shared. It is our goal to make your visits to our sites easy and enjoyable. 

**About IP Addresses**

TEC-IT collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information. 

An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers - the big computers that "serve" up Web pages - automatically identify your computer by its IP address. 

When guests request pages from TEC-IT sites, our servers log the guests' IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. 

**Use of Cookies   **

What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences while you're at our site. The use of cookies is an Industry standard, and you'll find cookies at most major Web sites. 

By showing how and when guests use the site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. If you accept the first tracking cookie from Trails-End.com, you won't be offered as many afterwards. 

Examples of How TEC-IT Sites Use Cookies:

A cookie lets the computer remember that you've registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities at our sites. Similarly, the Trails-End Store uses a temporary cookie to track which products you've chosen to purchase while shopping. The cookie expires once you're done shopping. Letting it do the record keeping saves you the trouble of entering information over and over again during a single visit. If you decline this cookie, you may have difficulty ordering your selections. 

Examples of How TEC-IT Sites Do Not Use Cookies:

TEC-IT Sites never use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except as described below, TEC-IT Sites do not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any other third parties than the BSA whatsoever. 

TEC-IT Sites do not use cookies to identify specific individuals, except in such cases as online shopping (see above) and contest registration (where a cookie allows you to enter a contest every day without registering again each time). 

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some areas of the site, such as any shopping, contest, or game areas, will not function properly if you do so. 

**Links to Other Sites**

Users should be aware that when you are on TEC-IT sites you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from TEC-IT sites that take you outside our service. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, the "click" takes you off TEC-IT site. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use TEC-IT logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information. Always be aware of where you end up. 

Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online - for example, via message boards or chat - that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While TEC-IT strives to protect its user's personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk. 

** Security Policy **

The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our Guests is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers, utilizing encryption software. 

Only those employees who need access to your information in order to do their jobs are allowed access, each having signed compressive nondisclosure agreements, which provides explicit legal confidentiality protections. Any employee who violates our privacy and/or security policies is subject to disciplinary action, including possible termination and civil and/or criminal prosecution. 

**Your Acceptance of These Terms**

By using this site, you signify your assent to the TEC-IT Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our sites. Your continued use of the TEC-IT sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. You can send an e-mail to us with any further questions.
