We urge you to read our Privacy Policy carefully.

## 2\. Why We Ask You For Your Personal Information

We ask you for your personal information for the following purposes:

  * to facilitate the provision of the products and services you request from us including verification of your identity;
  * to provide you with information and offers on our products and services, that we believe may be of interest to you, and in certain circumstances to allow Travelex group companies (that is, Travelex subsidiaries and affiliates) to provide you with information about their own products or services; and
  * to comply with the law.

  


## 3\. Information We Collect and How We Use It

If you choose to order products or services from us, via telephone, mail, in person at one of our retail outlets, or from our Website, you will have to provide us with certain information, including personal information such as: your name, mailing and/or e-mail address, credit or debit card information, Driver’s License or passport and/or other photographic identification. We may also obtain information about your transactions with us and/or our group companies and other information for payment purposes or to comply with legal requirements.

Federal law requires us to obtain, verify and record information in order to confirm your identity. This information will include your name, address, date of birth and any other information required in order to complete the verification process. The information provided by you and the results of the verification process will be retained by Travelex and our third party fraud checking agent for audit and fraud prevention purposes.

We limit the personal information we collect to only that which is required to execute a transaction, provide you with information about our products and services, and to meet the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.

## 4\. Disclosure of and Control Over Personal Information

We will only disclose personal information to other Travelex group companies or third parties for everyday business purposes, such as to process your transactions, maintain your account(s), perform information technology functions, respond to court orders and legal investigations, report to credit bureaus, or to offer our products and services to you. Please note that these disclosures are not subject to an opt out choice, as such disclosures are necessary to run our everyday business.

## 5\. Protection of Personal Information

We maintain physical, organizational and electronic security measures to protect your personal information. These include the use of secure locks on doors, restricted access to our information processing and storage areas, limited access to relevant information by authorized employees and independent contractors only ("Employees"), and through the use of passwords and pass keys. We instruct our Employees with access to your information that it is to be used only in adherence with the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy and the laws applicable to each specific business. As a condition of employment, our Employees are required to sign a confidentiality agreement binding them to this responsibility, which remains with them even if they leave or retire from Travelex. We hold all Employees fully accountable for adhering to this Privacy Policy and the law.

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted to the Website. However, your order is placed over a secure connection and your personal information is encrypted to ensure your data remains as safe as possible.

## 6\. Accessing Your Personal Information

If you want to review or verify your personal information, find out to whom we have disclosed it, as permitted by this Privacy Policy, or if you are unsure whether we have a record containing your personal information and would like to confirm whether or not we do, you can contact us, as per the contact information in paragraph 12 below, and we will respond to your request as soon as possible. If you wish to have your personal information deleted, we may not be able to honor your request due to financial regulations. At that time, we will need specific information from you to enable us to search for, and provide you with, the personal information we hold about you.

There may be instances where we will not be able to provide the personal information we hold about you that you request. Some of these instances include if it:

  * contains references to other persons;
  * is subject to attorney-client or litigation privilege;
  * contains our own proprietary information that is confidential to us;
  * has already been destroyed due to legal requirements or because we no longer need it for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy;
  * is too costly, in our determination, to retrieve; or
  * cannot be disclosed for legal reasons.
  * If we are unable to provide you with access to your personal information, we will always explain the reason why, if possible.

  


## 7\. Keeping Your Personal Information Accurate

We take reasonable steps to maintain the accuracy of your personal information for as long as it is being used for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, and you play an active role in keeping us up-to-date. Prompt notification of any changes, for example to your mailing address or telephone number, will help us provide you with the best possible service. Should you discover, upon review of your personal information, that amendments are required, please advise us. We will use our best efforts to advise others of any important amendments to your personal information which we may have released to them.

## 8\. Retention

We only keep your personal information for as long as and to the extent that we need it to meet the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. The length of time we retain your personal information is also affected by: (1) the type of product or service you have with us; and (2) any legal requirements we may have to meet.

## 9\. Unsolicited Direct Marketing

Your personal information will not be provided to any other member of the Travelex group of companies or third parties for their own direct marketing purposes unless you have expressly consented to such activities. If you do not wish to receive marketing materials from us you may opt out of such activities by contacting us at the e-mail address or telephone number provided in paragraph 12 below, or by clicking the unsubscribe option in any e-mail marketing communications we send you. Consumers acknowledge that they may be contacted by mail, telephone or e-mail for customer service and/or billing purposes. We do not sell lists of consumers of our products and services to unaffiliated third parties for their use, except where necessary in connection with the sale or acquisition of some or all of the business.

## 10\. Website Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy governs any dealings you enter into with us on the internet. We consider any information we collect through the internet to be personal information, and therefore only use such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

On our Website, we may collect information about your computer, including where available, your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users’ browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify you as an individual.

For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a “cookie” file. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored on your computer's hard drive by your browser. They help us improve the Website and make it possible for Travelex to identify some of your preferences. On revisiting the Website, Travelex's computer server will recognize the cookie, giving us information about your previous visits. Most browsers are originally configured to accept cookies automatically.

You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if not configured or if you alter your browser to disable the acceptance of cookies, you may not be able to use the Website. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to the Website.

The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.

We employ [or our third party advertising partner employs] a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.
