# Hotwire Travel Ticker: Discount travel deals

### The most important part:

  * We can't stand spam, either. We won't sell or rent your personal information without your consent.
  * You can remove your email address from our system at any time by following the directions at the bottom of any Hotwire email.



### What information we collect from you

**Subscribers:** When you subscribe to Travel Ticker, we collect information such as your Zip code and email address. Unless otherwise noted, we may also collect any other information you provide to Travel Ticker.

**All visitors:** For all visitors (not just subscribers), we automatically collect other information such as IP addresses, browser type, domain names, access times, duration of visit, referring URL, platform, new/repeat information, timestamp and exit page information.

**Cookies:** A cookie is a unique identifier sent to your computer by a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie lets a computer server identify your computer before you actively log in. Our cookies do not include any sensitive information, but they do help us track which of our site pages are visited and what services are most often used. We also use cookies to improve your site experience. Please note that in order to fully use our Site, your web browser must be configured to accept cookies. Hotwire and Travel Ticker do not use cookies to retrieve personal information from your computer.

**Information collected by third-party advertising companies:** Third-party advertisers may use cookies and action tags (also known as web beacons or one-pixel .gif files) to measure the effectiveness of ads place on our site. Travel Ticker does not have access to the third-party companies' cookies, which are similar to our own cookies.

### How your information is used

**Subscribers:** The data we collect is used to communicate with you, including sending you promotional messages. We also use the information that we gather to design our Site to more closely match your interests, and to target email marketing messages that may be more appropriate to your needs.

**All visitors:** We use the other information we automatically collect about all visitors for statistical purposes so that we may analyze trends and performance over time.

### With whom we may share your information

In general, we promise never to sell or rent any of your personal information without your prior consent. In addition, we may share information in the following ways:

**Third-party service providers:** Travel Ticker will share your information with business firms contracted to provide specific services to us, in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. For instance, we may contract for third parties to provide us with business analytics, marketing or distribution of surveys, contests and sweepstakes programs. In situations such as this where your data is shared with a third-party firm, these firms are contractually obligated to only use your personal data for the purpose for which the relationship exists. These firms do not have the right to share your data with other organizations or contact you outside the bounds of their contract with us.

**Advertisers and partners:** We may share general statistical information about our Site and visitors -- such as number of visitors, aggregate and non-personally identifiable demographic data, number and type of goods and services booked -- with our advertisers and partners. However, we do not reveal your name, address or other personal data for anything other than the use it was originally intended without giving you the opportunity to opt out.

We may also share your personal information in the following situations:

Travel Ticker may disclose information about you to others if we have a good-faith belief that we are required to do so by law or legal process; to respond to claims; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Travel Ticker or others. This includes, but is not limited to, customer fraud, technical malfunctions, or abuse of our network or systems. We also may provide customer information to third parties for the purpose of resolving disputes that arise in the normal course of business. Except as otherwise stated above, Travel Ticker will not disclose your personal information to any third party without your consent.

In the event that Travel Ticker is acquired, or substantially all of Travel Ticker's assets are acquired, customer information may be transferred to the successor company. In the event such a transfer occurs, your personal information will be subject to the same protection as it was prior to the transfer.
