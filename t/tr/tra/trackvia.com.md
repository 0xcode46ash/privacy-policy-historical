1\. We do not reveal any personal information that we collect about you, nor any information or data that you store in your Account, to anyone else. We will share your personally identifiable information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.

During the registration process, TrackVia collects personally identifiable information (Required Information: First Name, Last Name, Email Address and Optional Information: Organization Name and Phone Number) from the Subscribing Organizations and their Users. Individuals who sign up are also required to create a user name and password for their account. TrackVia uses this information to communicate with organizations during the trial period via email and phone outreach to help get organizations up and running. In addition, TrackVia sends a monthly newsletter to all users who have not opted out of receiving email correspondence from TrackVia. TrackVia may also collect personally identifiable information at other times, such as when responding to product support inquiries. This information is only used to contact the user to help resolve support inquiries. TrackVia may also contact the user via email to announce improvements to the TrackVia interface. In addition, the TrackVia application allows you to store data and information that is personally identifiable, private, or sensitive. TrackVia may use such information in the aggregate only for its own internal purposes. Account administrators also input their Credit Card information (card type, name on card, billing address, city, state, zip, country, card number and expiration date) when signing up for a paying account. Credit card numbers are stored with payment gateway [authorize.net](http://authorize.net/) and no TrackVia employee can see credit card numbers. We will not sell, rent or release a Subscribing Organization’s or User’s personally identifiable information, application data, or stored information to any other party, except at the request of the Subscribing Organization or under certain rare special circumstances such as court order.

2\. TrackVia analyzes information about you only on a basis that does not personally identify you. In order to improve our Service, provide content and develop applications and services that are useful to our Subscribing Organizations and Users, TrackVia may automatically gather information on an aggregate basis about the applications, services and pages of the TrackVia application that Users visit and use. A Subscribing Organization’s or its Users’ personally identifiable information cannot be linked to or discerned from any of this information. TrackVia may also use demographic information and profile data about Subscribing Organizations and Users for these purposes.

3\. TrackVia does not use personally identifiable information to track site visitors. However, once a visitor chooses to create a trial account, then TrackVia is able to link a customer’s personally identifiable information (First Name, Last Name, Email Address, Organization Name and Phone Number) via a cookie. In order to offer our Services and to enable certain application features and functionality, TrackVia uses cookies. Cookies are used to determine when a users’ account has been inactive for four hours. For security purposes, TrackVia automatically logs users out of an account that has been inactive for over four hours. Cookies are also used to identify IP addresses of site visitors enabling us to determine site pages visited. This information is only used internally to identify opportunities to improve our website and application.

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.

Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by TrackVia or analytics. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.  
Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.

We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking here (or if located in the European Union click here). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.

4\. Internally, we restrict access to all Subscriber information to employees who need access to it to do their jobs. These employees include those engaged in customer support activities or those providing custom services purchased by Subscribing Organizations. These employees are limited in number, and are committed to our privacy and security policies. Any employee who violates our privacy and/or security policies is subject to possible termination and civil and/or criminal prosecution.

5\. Newsletters are sent to users on a monthly basis. Newsletters are sent via email to the account administrator’s registered email address. All email correspondence sent from TrackVia includes an opt-out link at the bottom of the newsletter. All individuals who opt out are automatically removed from future email distribution lists. Users may also send a letter to TrackVia at 1675 Larimer Street, Suite 500, Denver, CO 80202 requesting removal from our email list, or users may call 303.278.1223 to ask for their name to be removed. We will then remove the user’s email address from our mailing list.
