# Trackvia - An Online Database for Tracking and Sharing Data

Trackvia Privacy Policy

The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for the services offered by Trackvia, Inc. (the "Services") and for this website. Trackvia reserves the right to amend this Privacy Statement at any time with or without notice. Only the current Privacy Statement is deemed effective, so please review this Privacy Statement periodically. 

**1) We do not reveal any personal information that we collect about you, nor any information or data that you store in your Account, to anyone else.**

During the registration process, Trackvia collects personally identifiable information from the Subscribing Organizations and their Users. Trackvia may also collect personally identifiable information at other times, such as when responding to product support inquiries. In addition, the Trackvia application allows you to store data and information that is personally identifiable, private, or sensitive. Trackvia uses such information only for its own internal purposes. We will not sell, rent or release a Subscribing Organization's or User's personally identifiable information, application data, or stored information to any other party, except at the request of the Subscribing Organization or under certain rare special circumstances such as court order. 

**2) Trackvia shares information about you only on a basis that does not personally identify you.**

In order to improve our Service, provide content and develop applications and services that are useful to our Subscribing Organizations and Users, Trackvia may automatically gather information on an aggregate basis about the applications, services and pages of the Trackvia application that Users visit and use. A Subscribing Organization's or its Users' personally identifiable information cannot be linked to or discerned from any of this information. Trackvia may also use demographic information and profile data about Subscribing Organizations and Users for these purposes. 

**3) Trackvia uses cookies.**

In order to offer our Services and to enable certain application features and functionality, Trackvia uses cookies.

**4) Internally, we restrict access to all Subscriber information to employees who need access to it to do their jobs.**

These employees include those engaged in customer support activities or those providing custom services purchased by Subscribing Organizations. These employees are limited in number, and are committed to our privacy and security policies. Any employee who violates our privacy and/or security policies is subject to possible termination and civil and/or criminal prosecution. 

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure, and there is a risk that data could be intercepted or interrupted during Internet transmission. Trackvia cannot warrant the security of any information Subscribing Organizations or Users transmit to or from our online services, and Subscribing Organizations and Users do so at their own risk.
