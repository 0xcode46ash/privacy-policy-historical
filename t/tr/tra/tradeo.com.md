## You choose to whom you want to make your performances public

Choosing to make your information public is exactly what it sounds like: anyone, including people off of Tradeo, will be able to see it.   
Choosing to make your information public also means that this information:   
\-- may be associated with you (i.e., your name, profile picture, Tradeo profile, User ID, etc.) even off Tradeo   
\-- may show up when someone does a search on Tradeo or on a public search engine   
\-- may be accessible to the applications and websites you and your peers use   
\-- may be accessible to anyone who uses our APIs.   
Sometimes you will not be able to select an audience when you post something (like when you write on a Page's wall or comment on a news article that uses our comments plugin). This is because some types of posts are always public posts. As a general rule, you should assume that if you do not see a sharing icon, the information will be publicly available.   
\-- Name: This helps other users, such as your friends and family, find you. If you are uncomfortable sharing your real name, you can always deactivate or delete your account.   
\-- Profile Pictures: This helps your friends and family recognize you. If you are uncomfortable making your profile picture public, you can always delete it.   
\-- Username and User ID: These allow you to give out a custom link to your profile or Page and receive Tradeo messages in your private Tradeo inbox.   
\-- Biography summary – a short description about yourself which you enter after creating an account.   
A Username (or Tradeo URL) is a custom link to your profile that you can give out to people or post on external websites. If you have selected a username, it will always appear in the URL on your profile page. If you have not selected a username, then the URL on your profile page will contain your User ID, which is what we use to identify your Tradeo account.   
If someone has your Username or User ID, they can use it to access information about you through the Tradeo.com website. For example, if someone has your Username, they can type Tradeo.com/Username into their browser and see your public information as well as anything else you've let them see. Similarly, someone with your Username or User ID can access information about you through our APIs. Specifically, they can access your public information, along with your age range, locale (or language) and gender.
