Tradeo may set and access proprietary and other cookies on your computer, enabling us to
learn which promotions bring users to our Web site. Tradeo may use cookies in connection with
our products and services to track your activities on our Web sites. Such information that we
collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. We may provide links to
third­party Websites as a service to our users. In addition, some of the content appearing to be

Websites or incorporation through framesets of content supplied by third­party servers. Please

Tradeo understands the importance of protecting children’s privacy, especially in an on­line

the manner described in this Privacy Policy and elsewhere on the Site. We reserve the right to
make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will alert you to any such changes by
updating this Privacy Policy.
What information do we collect?
When you browse the non­password protected portions of our Site, you do so anonymously; no
personally identifiable information is collected. When you sign up to become a registered user of
Tradeo we request that you provide to us your name, address and email address, as well as
your trading behavior, such as the techniques you use and the instruments you trade. We
process your personal information only for specific and limited purposes. We ask only for data
that is adequate, relevant and not excessive for those purposes. Some of these purposes may
include to inform you of new services we will be providing, to send you requested product
information and promotional material, for marketing purposes and market research, and
internally to help us improve our Services and to help resolve any problems.
You may also choose to supply trading information (e.g., how long you have been trading, your
preferred trading hours, etc.) and a profile description. Once you register with Tradeo and sign


in to our Site, you are not anonymous to us. We may use the Registration Information to open
an account with us, to provide services that may be useful to you and to contact you. We may
also collect information about you from other registered users, such as when they tag you in a
post, or otherwise indicate a relationship with you.
Our Site also permits you to contact us via email and our Contact Us form. Whenever you send
an email via our Site or through the Contact Us form, you will be providing us with your name,
email address and any information you choose to include in the text of your message. For
example, you may choose to provide your mailing address or other information necessary or
helpful for us to address your query or concern.
When you use our Services, we automatically receive and record information from your
computer, documents, and browser, including your IP address, cookie information, software and
hardware attributes.
In addition, as a registered user of our Site, we may collect and maintain information about your
membership activity. This activity includes your trading ideas, sent and received messages,
executed transactions, positions, history, comments (including those on your friends’ walls),
chats, subscriptions to other members as well as ratings of other members’ trading ideas and
comments and their ratings of you. We publish this information and derivatives based on this
information on our Site and we use this information to provide the services you have requested.
Choices for Personal Information
When you sign up for Services we ask you to provide personal and contact information. If we
use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we
will ask for your consent prior to such use.
If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this
Policy and/or in the specific service notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the
use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive
information (i.e. medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political affiliation) for
purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in relevant agreements, unless we
have obtained your prior consent. You can decline to submit personal information, in which case
Tradeo may not be able to provide you with Services.
What do we use your information for?
Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:
To personalize your experience
(your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs)
To improve our website
(we continually strive to improve our website offerings based on the information and feedback
we receive from you)
To improve customer service
(your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service requests and
support needs)
To process transactions


Your information, whether public or private, will not be sold, exchanged, transferred, or given to
any other company for any reason whatsoever, without your consent, other than for the express
purpose of delivering the purchased product or service requested.
To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature
To send periodic emails
By registering with Tradeo, you understand that we may send you communications or data from
Tradeo regarding the services, including but not limited to (i) notices about your use of the
services, including any notices concerning violations of use, (ii) updates, (iii) affiliate promotions,
(iv) company news, and (v) promotional information and materials regarding Tradeo’s products
and services, via electronic mail. We give you the opportunity to opt­out of receiving electronic
mail from us by following the opt­out instructions provided in the message.
To enable the sharing of information between users
Our platform will enable users to share trading information with other friends in their network
based on personalized privacy settings.
How We Share Information?
Tradeo enables you to share information with others in your Tradeo networks — while providing
you with privacy settings that you can use to restrict other users from accessing your
information. We share your information with third parties when we believe the sharing is
permitted by you, reasonably necessary to offer our services, or when legally required to do so.
For example:
When you invite a peer to join
When you ask us to invite a peer to join Tradeo, we will send your peer a message on your
behalf using your name. If your peer does not want us to keep their information, we will remove
it at their request.
When you choose to share your information with marketers
You may choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers that are
not associated with Tradeo through on­site offers. This is entirely at your discretion and we will
not provide your information to these marketers without your consent.
To give search engines access to publicly available information
We generally limit search engines’ access to our site. We may allow them to access information
set to the “public” setting and your public search listing, but you can turn off your public search
listing in your privacy settings.
To help improve or promote our service
Sometimes we share aggregated, non personally identifiable information with third parties to
help improve or promote the service we provide. But we only do so in such a way that no
individual user can be identified or linked to any specific action or information. Tradeo will use
such information provided by users for the following purposes:
∙        To create aggregate, non­personal, demographic reports about the users of the service
and to generate aggregate statistical studies and conduct research related to the Services and
the use of the Site.
∙        Provide Users with certain content that may be of interest to that user based on the
information the user provides.


To provide you with services
We may provide information to service providers that help us bring you the services we offer.
For example, we may use third parties to help host our website, remove repetitive information
from our user lists, or provide search results or links (including sponsored links). These service
providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time, but when this
occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that
information to helping us provide the service.
To respond to legal requests and prevent harm
We may disclose information pursuant to subpoenas, court orders, or other requests (including
criminal and civil matters) if we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law. We
may also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or
other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to protect ourselves and you from
people violating our terms of use and privacy policy. This may include sharing information with
other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities.
How do we protect your information?
We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information
when you enter, submit, or access your personal information.
We strive to maintain the reliability, accuracy, completeness and currency of personal
information that we collect and to protect the privacy and security of our customers. We keep
your personal information only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it
was collected or to comply with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or document retention
requirements.
We limit access to personal information about you to employees, contractors and agents who
we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information. These individuals are
bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and
criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Database to be only
accessed by those authorized with special access rights to our systems, and are required to
keep the information confidential. Our servers and our databases are protected by industry
standard security technology, such as industry standard firewalls and password protection.
After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials,
etc.) will be kept on file for more than 60 days in order to analyze your trading account
information, share with your friends and socialize the Capital Markets.
Although we cannot guarantee against any loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration or
destruction of data, we try to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.
Please contact us at the above address for any additional questions about our information
security or the protection of personal data.
Data integrity, accessing and updating personal information


Tradeo processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in
accordance with this Policy or any applicable service agreements. We review our data
collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process
the personal information needed to provide or improve our Services. We take reasonable steps
to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we
depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.
Upon receipt of your written request and enough information to permit us to identify your
personal information, we will disclose to you the information we hold about you. We will also
correct, amend or delete any personal information that is inaccurate and notify any third party
recipients of the necessary changes.
We do not charge for complying with a correction request, however, for all other requests, we
may charge a small fee to cover its costs. Requests to delete personal information are subject
to any applicable legal and ethical reporting or document retention obligations imposed on
Tradeo.
We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed,
corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process
requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort,
jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical, or for which access is not
otherwise required.
Please contact us at the above address for any additional questions or to access and update
personal information.
You Choose to Whom You Want to Make Your Performances Public
Choosing to make your information public is exactly what it sounds like: anyone, including
people off of Tradeo, will be able to see it.
Choosing to make your information public also means that this information:
­        can be associated with you (i.e., your name, profile picture, Tradeo profile, User ID, etc.)
even off Tradeo
­        can show up when someone does a search on Tradeo or on a public search engine
­        will be accessible to the applications and websites you and your peers use
­        will be accessible to anyone who uses our APIs.
Sometimes you will not be able to select an audience when you post something (like when you
write on a Page's wall or comment on a news article that uses our comments plugin). This is
because some types of posts are always public posts. As a general rule, you should assume
that if you do not see a sharing icon, the information will be publicly available.
When others share information about you, they can also choose to make it public.
Information that is always publicly available
The types of information listed below are always publicly available, and are treated just like
information you decided to make public.
­        Name: This helps other users, such as your friends and family, find you. If you are
uncomfortable sharing your real name, you can always deactivate or delete your account.


­        Profile Pictures: This helps your friends and family recognize you. If you are
uncomfortable making your profile picture public, you can always delete it.
­        Username and User ID: These allow you to give out a custom link to your profile or Page
and receive Tradeo messages in your private Tradeo inbox.
­        Biography summary – a short description about yourself which you enter after creating
an account.
Usernames and User IDs
A Username (or Tradeo URL) is a custom link to your profile that you can give out to people or
post on external websites. If you have selected a username, it will always appear in the URL on
your profile page. If you have not selected a username, then the URL on your profile page will
contain your User ID, which is what we use to identify your Tradeo account.
If someone has your Username or User ID, they can use it to access information about you
through the Tradeo.com website. For example, if someone has your Username, they can type
Tradeo.com/Username into their browser and see your public information as well as anything
else you've let them see. Similarly, someone with your Username or User ID can access
information about you through our APIs. Specifically, they can access your public information,
along with your age range, locale (or language) and gender.
If you do not want your information to be accessible through our APIs, you can opt out from your
Privacy Settings.
Do we use cookies?
Yes. In order to collect the anonymous data described herein, we may use temporary “cookies”
that remain in the cookies file of your browser until the browser is closed. Cookies by
themselves cannot be used to discover the identity of the user. A cookie is a small piece of
information which is sent to your browser and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies do
not damage your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.
This enables you to decide if you want to accept it or not.
Do we disclose any information to outside parties?
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable
information, except as specifically otherwise indicated in this Privacy Policy. This does not
include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or
servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also
release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce
our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non­personally
identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or
other uses. Tradeo may provide non­identifiable, general statistical and demographic
information to third parties from time to time.
Third party links
Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our
website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore


have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless,
we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.
Advertisements
Sometimes the advertisers who present ads on Tradeo use technological methods to measure
the effectiveness of their adds and to personalize advertising content. You may opt out of the
placement of cookies by many of these advertisers here. You may also use your browser cookie
settings to limit or prevent the placement of cookies by advertising networks. Tradeo does not
share personally identifiable information with advertisers unless we get your permission.
Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance
We are in compliance with the requirements of COPPA (Childrens Online Privacy Protection
Act), we do not collect any information from anyone under 13 years of age. Our website,
products and services are all directed to people who are at least 13 years old or older.
Enforcement
Tradeo regularly reviews its compliance with this Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions
or concerns regarding this Policy or our treatment of personal information by contacting us as
provided above. When we receive formal written complaints it is Tradeo's policy to contact the
complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate
regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints
regarding the transfer of personal information that cannot be resolved between Tradeo and an
individual.
Deleting and deactivating your account
If you want to stop using your account, you can either deactivate or delete it.
Deactivate
Deactivating your account puts your account on hold. Other users will no longer see your profile,
but we do not delete any of your information. Deactivating an account is the same as you telling
us not to delete any information because you might want to reactivate your account at some
point in the future. You can deactivate your account at:
https://www.tradeo.com/profile/deactivate.
Consent to Processing Information
By providing any personally identifiable information to us pursuant to this Privacy Policy, all
users, including, without limitation, users in the United States and member states of the
European Union, fully understand and unambiguously consent to this Privacy Policy and to the
collection and processing of such information abroad. The server on which this website is
hosted may be outside the country from which you access this Site and may be outside your

Personally identifiable information through this Site, you consent, acknowledge, and agree that


we may collect, use, transfer, and disclose your personally identifiable information as described
in this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use
this Site.
Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control
If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, we may transfer your
information to the new owner so that the service can continue to operate. In such a case, your
information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre­existing privacy policy.
