## What information does Travelalerts.ca collect from you?

Travelalerts.ca’s registration requires that members provide basic contact and demographic information such as first and last name, email, city of departure or residence and other details or preferences, in order for members to fully benefit from our services. 

  


## How is the information Travelalerts.ca collects used?

This information is used to send you newsletters, promotions, information about our services and partners, personalize your experience with us or inform you if you are the winner of one of our contests. This information may also be used for investigating cases of abuse or fraud by a member.  
Furthermore, Travelalerts.ca allows users to send information about our services and special offers to their friends. When running contests, Travelalerts.ca may also ask for referrals to increase an entrant’s chances of winning.   
When a friend uses our referral services or Tell-a-Friend we generally send the friend an email inviting them to check out featured promotions, register to our services, participate in our contest or visit our site. Travelalerts.ca has no control over who receives these emails.  
Please note that at all times, users can click the unsubscribe link on one of the emails received in order to unsubscribe to our services.

  


## How is this information disclosed?

Travelalerts.ca does not sell or rent your Personal Data to anyone. Travelalerts.ca will share Personal Data with third parties only as a requirement for fulfilling a service you have chosen.   
Travelalerts.ca may disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating the Terms of Use of Travelalerts.ca or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the rights or property of Travelalerts.ca, other users of Travelalerts.ca, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Travelalerts.ca may disclose or access personal information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.

  


## What cookies are and how are they used?

As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, Travelalerts.ca may use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you.   
A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive.   
Generally, we use cookies to identify and label all "new" offers since your last visit to the site, to enable you to "checklist" offers that you want to mark for future retrieval and viewing, to identify where you are and present offers that are catered to your specific geographic location. Advertisers that serve offers onto Travelalerts.ca may also use their own cookies. Travelalerts.ca has no access to or control over these cookies.  
Travelalerts.ca may also collect IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to prevent, investigate, and take actions in the case of suspected fraud or abuse.   
Most Web browsers provide users the ability to limit the use of cookies by allowing users to adjust privacy settings. If a user has their cookies disabled, some sections and services of Travelalerts.ca may not perform as well as they normally would with cookies enabled.

  


## What kind of security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information?

Other than the administrator of Travelalerts.ca or other authorized personnel of Travelalerts.ca, you are the only person who has access to your personal information.   
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Travelalerts.ca cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
