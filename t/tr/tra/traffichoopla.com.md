**Our work started** back in 2002 with the very first Hit Exchange Report. With a degree in mathematics and statistics, a teaching background and entrepreneur/sales experience, we then launched this traffic builder in early 2003. Since then, we have literally helped thousands of people from around the world to increase and maximize their Internet traffic/advertising. Today, we are most known for our weekly testing reports at [TestHoopla](http://testhoopla.com/) and our most popular product/service is our traffic packages at [HitsHoopla](http://hitshoopla.com/).   
**We are not a money maker!** Although several of our sites offer a free affiliate program that pays single level commissions, we are not about making money. Your business... your website... your product... is your money maker. We simply offer useful resources that can help you to increase and maximize your business.
