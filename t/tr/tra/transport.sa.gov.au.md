Privacy Statement

Transport SA respects your privacy. This privacy statement therefore tells you what information we collect and how that information is stored and used.

Data automatically collected

Whenever you visit our web site, we automatically record 

  * your IP address
  * the date and time of your visit
  * the pages you access
  * the documents you download
  * the type of browser you use. 



These statistics tell us how our site is being used and helps us improve it to make your visit useful and enjoyable.

This information does not identify you personally. No attempt is made to identify you except, in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect our service provider's logs.

We also collect the key words you use when you do a search of our site. This information is not linked to any other data we collect. We use this information to find out what people are looking for and how we can improve our services.

Cookies

A cookie is a small piece of data that a web site can transfer to your computer hard drive for record keeping. Transport SA may use cookies to help you access and use our site and improve the service we offer. There is no attempt to identify you personally.

The use of cookies in this way is widespread and commonly accepted by the Internet community. You can set your browser to reject a cookie that Transport SA attempts to place on your computer. However you may then be limited in your use of some areas of the site.

Collection of personal information

Email addresses

Transport SA will only record your e-mail address if you send us a message by e-mail or you include it in an online form. 

It will only be used to send you a reply and not added to a mailing list or used for any other purpose without your consent.

The email address is stored in a secure area and only forwarded to appropriate staff so they can answer your question.

Online transactions

When you perform an online transaction we update our relevant databases and store transaction information to use for future transactions and for audit purposes.

Access to this information is restricted to Transport SA personnel who need to transact business with you. Your name, address, credit card information or personal information will not be sold or given away to any other person, company or organisation without your consent. However, we must cooperate fully should a situation arise where we are required by law or legal process to provide information about a customer.

All information is securely transmitted using standard encryption processes. 

If you do not wish to transmit the required details electronically you can contact us in a variety of other ways. {needs embedded link to Contact Us}
