# www.traveladnetwork.com - Privacy Policy

Travel Ad Network (TAN) is committed to protecting the privacy of online consumers. This notice explains our online technology and information-collection practices.

## Information Collection

TAN does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) of users. TAN has worked with our third-party ad-serving technology provider, ZEDO, Inc., to ensure that we adhere to the privacy guidelines created by the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) and the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB). ZEDO does not collect any PII on users, and it uses cookies in the ad-delivery process only. When a user views an TAN online advertisement, he or she is assigned a number, known as a cookie, that is unique but that does not identify the user personally. The cookie is recorded and stored on the user's computer in the Web browser's cookie file. 

For more information about ZEDO's privacy policy, please refer to:

## Opting Out

If you want your browser not to store this information, a simple procedure allows you to deny this feature. In order to opt out of the benefits of cookies, you can manually delete your cookies by following the instructions contained in the "help" section of your browser.

##  Information Collection by Our Advertisers

Personally identifiable information (PII) may be collected by advertisers using TAN. The PII is provided by consumers for purposes such as the purchase of goods and services, order shipment and sweepstakes entry. The information collected is subject to the policies of each advertiser.

TAN does not make any representation regarding the accuracy or suitability of any of the information contained in those advertisements. TAN does not accept any responsibility or liability for the conduct or content of those advertisements and the offerings made by those advertisers. Advertisements and links to other sites where goods or services are advertised are not endorsements or recommendations by TAN of the third-party sites, goods or services. Your access to or use of them is at your own discretion.

## Spyware/Adware

TAN does not download any third-party software onto your computer. In many cases, this software is bundled with free programs, updates or files and can trigger pop-up ads when you're on the Internet. Please be assured that these programs are not in any way affiliated with TAN.
