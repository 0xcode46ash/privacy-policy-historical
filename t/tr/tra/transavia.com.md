## Current policy with regard to processing of personal information

Transavia is increasingly obliged to provide various authorities in countries around the world – particularly customs and immigration services – in advance with the personal and travel details of its passengers in connection with normal flight operations. This is necessary for the fulfilment of the contract of carriage and for reasons of safety in particular. We wish to emphasise that the authorities concerned have assured us that your reservation details will only be used for safety purposes and can only be accessed by authorised personnel.

## No-fly list

To maintain and manage the proper order and safety of and during flights, Transavia has a No-fly list. This list contains the names of passengers who have disrupted safety, good order and discipline on board and/or on the ground to such an extent that they may not be flown on board a Transavia flight for a limited or unlimited period of time – or under conditions to be determined by Transavia. The persons concerned are informed personally by Transavia – and in writing if possible – about their placement on this list and the applicable time period.
