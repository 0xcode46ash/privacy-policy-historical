# Privacy

The [TransLink Enterprise Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/-/media/Documents/privacy/TransLink%20Enterprise%20Privacy%20Policy%20June%202015.pdf "TransLink Enterprise Privacy Policy - Opens in new window") reflects the requirements of the [ Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIPPA)](http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/96165_00 "Link to the 'FOIPPA' page on bclaws.ca - opens in a new window"), the regulatory requirements of the South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority Act (the “Act”) and other relevant legislation. 

The South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority (“TransLink”) is the regional transportation authority responsible for public transportation in the Metro Vancouver region. TransLink’s public transit services include bus, community shuttle, ferries (SeaBus), rapid transit (SkyTrain), commuter rail (West Coast Express) and custom transit services for persons with disabilities (Access Transit).

TransLink is committed to protecting your personal information. FOIPPA sets out the terms under which a public body can collect, use and disclose personal information and requires that reasonable steps be taken to protect the information they hold. FOIPPA defines personal information as recorded information about an identifiable individual other than contact information.

This Policy reflects our long-standing commitment to the protection of the privacy of the personal information in all of our business operations. It is designed to promote the transparency of our privacy practices for the reasonable collection, use and disclosure of personal information in the course of providing transportation services.

### Collection of Personal Information

We will notify you as to the purpose of the collection of personal information, as required by FOIPPA. For example, you will see notices on forms you may be asked to complete, signage posted on our transit vehicles, and facilities where we operate video surveillance equipment.

The types of personal information we collect include the following:

The personal information may be collected by TransLink or by our contractors, on our behalf. TransLink uses partners to provide some of our services and they may be required to collect personal information on our behalf. We ensure that all our partners adhere to the requirements of FOIPPA through contractual agreements.   
  
### Use and Disclosure of Personal Information   
  
TransLink will limit the use and disclosure of personal information in our custody and control to those permitted by FOIPPA. For example, there are a number of specific purposes for which we use and disclose personal information: 

  * to process your account credentials, passwords, communicate offers, and updates to our services and other information, if you have signed up to access to our websites;   
_For example, your email and password will be used to authenticate you so you can make changes to your profile, update your newsletter preferences and participate in contests and special promotions (if you’ve provided your consent in advance);_


  * to resolve disputes, mitigate or attempt to prevent fraud, investigate privacy and security incidents;   
_For example, during a privacy breach investigation, incident details may be shared with the Privacy Commissioner as part of our breach reporting due diligence program_


  * to investigate safety and security incidents on the transit system;   
_For example, we may use video surveillance to investigate safety and security incidents on the transit system; this may be disclosed to law enforcement in accordance with FOIPPA requirements_


  * to issue fare infraction tickets, collect ticket amounts and for the purpose of court proceedings in accordance with the Act.  
_For example, if a ticket remains unpaid, TransLink may share information with a collection agency for the purpose of recovering the debt._



Translink will not sell, trade or rent any personal information to third parties for marketing or any other commercial purpose. 

Personal information may be collected, used or disclosed without consent in limited circumstances where the conditions make it impossible or impractical to seek consent such as emergencies, health, safety and security of our employees, customers and the public or to collect outstanding debts or in the prevention of fraud or to comply with a subpoena, warrant or otherwise required by law.   
  
### How We Protect Your Personal Information  
  
At TransLink, we recognize the importance of protecting your personal information during the course of providing transit services. We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information using physical, electronic and procedural security measures appropriate to the sensitivity of the information in our custody or control. 

The standards may include safeguards to protect your information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification regardless of the format in which it is held. 

Our internal policies and procedures, based on “need-to-know” principles, restrict access to your information. We audit our procedures and measures regularly to ensure they are being administered properly and remain effective. 

Our suppliers, as part of the contractual arrangements, are bound by confidentiality clauses and may not use the information for any unauthorized purpose. We comply with FOIPPA regarding the storage of personal information. 

_TransLink will not include personal information on an email and ask you to verify it. If you get an email from TransLink asking for personal information, do not respond or open it or click any of the links or open attachments contained with the email. Please contact our customer service immediately._  
  
### How Long Your Information Is Kept
