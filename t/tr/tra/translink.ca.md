We may collect personal information when individuals submit comments to TransLink or register for online contests or other promotional programs we may offer or sign up for One Customer subscription services. This personal information may include individuals’ name, email address, phone number, street address, etc. 
  2. **Aggregated Information**   
We collect certain types of information about general activity at the TransLink website. This does not include personal identifying information, but does include how many times TransLink’s website has been visited, what pages or search terms have been requested most, what domain names (i.e., www.google.ca) visitors have arrived at our website from as well as the date and time of each visit. TransLink gathers and compiles this information into an aggregate form for statistical analysis and reporting purposes. These reports track website activity overall rather than on an individual level. TransLink uses third party measurement software to gather and compile aggregated information.
