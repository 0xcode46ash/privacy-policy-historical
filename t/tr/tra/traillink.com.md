Internet Protocol Address  
We collect an IP address from all visitors to our site. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our site, analyze trends, track users' movement, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in order for us to improve the site, and deliver customized, personalized content. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

Use of "Cookies"  
Our site may use cookies to enhance your experience while using our Site. Cookies are pieces of information that some websites transfer to the computer that is browsing that website and are used for record-keeping purposes at many websites. Use of cookies makes Web-surfing easier by performing certain functions such as saving your passwords, your personal preferences regarding your use of the particular website and to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. Many consider the use of cookies to be an industry standard.

Your browser is probably set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you can alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will not function properly when you view them.

Security  
All information provided to Rails-to-Trails Conservancy is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us. We also protect account information by placing it on a secure portion of our Site that is only accessible by certain qualified employees of Rails-to-Trails Conservancy. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet is 100 percentÂ secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information.

Tell-A-Friend  
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our Site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Rails-to-Trails Conservancy will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the Site. Rails-to-Trails Conservancy stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail.

Other websites  
Our Site contains links to other websites. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are entering another website for which Rails-to-Trails Conservancy has no responsibility. We encourage you to read the privacy statements on all such sites as their policies may be different than ours.
