If this policy changes then we will let you know via our homepage but we assure you that we only use your data as specified here and for legitimate business reasons. Continued access of Travelstart.co.za by you will constitute your acceptance of any changes or revisions to the Privacy Policy.

One of the goals of Travelstart.co.za is to bring you information that is tailored to your individual needs and, at the same time, protect your privacy. The following is a summary of the various ways we treat the information you provide us while using our site.

## The type of information Travelstart.co.za collects

1\. When you purchase products or services from the site.

2\. When you become a subscriber;

3\. When you activate an account

4\. When you speak to our travel desk personnel;

5\. Via explicit data capture measures, for example by entering competitions and completing surveys;

In any of the above cases the data we collect could be personal data, such as your e-mail address, name or phone number. Optional information such as your age, location or gender may also be requested.

## How Travelstart.co.za uses information provided by you

When you buy anything via our website or give us any personal data as indicated above, we may need to collect information about you to process the transaction, fulfill your order and provide you with the services you expect then, and in the future. This information may include, but is not limited to, details such as your name, your address, your phone number and your credit card details. 

Unless we have your express consent we will only disclose personal data to third parties if this is required for the purpose of completing your transaction with us. This is of course subject to the proviso that we may disclose your data to certain permitted third parties, such as members of our own group, our own professional advisers who are bound by confidentiality codes, and when we are legally obliged to disclose your data. 

**Travelstart.co.za** retains and uses your personal information to provide you with the best remote commerce experience by providing you with a personalised service and to give you details of offers which we think will be of interest to you. We may also use the information to process any transactions you undertake with us and for internal administration and analysis.

We do not sell, rent or trade your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes without your express consent.

There may also be occasion when we are legally required to provide access to our database in order to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings. In those instances, the information is provided only for that purpose. 

## Cookies

**Travelstart.co.za** uses cookies. A cookie is a small text file of which there are three types:

**Session cookies:** These are used to maintain something called session state. If you consider your journey through the site to be a conversation with us and this cookie just reminds the site where we were in that conversation (for instance if at some point in the conversation you asked us to add a hotel to your basket, next time you click on the basket it is still there). These are required for the site to function but are not used in any way to identify you personally.

**Permanent cookies:** These store a few numbers on your hard drive. You can view them by looking in the cookies directory of your browser installation if you are interested. They last for a long time and each time you come to our site you send us a copy of them. We use them to identify you between visits. For instance if you were looking at hotels in Cape Town last time you were on the site and we have a great hotel deal we may use this cookie to recognise you and show you our great deal. They are not required for the site to work but may enhance your experience. We do not store any personal data in these cookies, just a unique number that identifies you to us. 

Although you cannot block "session" cookies as they are required for our site to function correctly you can configure your internet browser so that it can reject "permanent" cookies. How you do this will depend upon the internet browser you use. It is therefore impractical for us to detail here how you can reject those cookies. Please refer to the relevant internet browser manufacturer's website where you should be able to receive all the information you need.

Your Internet Protocol ("IP") address is usually associated with the place from which you enter the Internet, like your Internet Service Provider, your company or your university.
