You can access, modify or update your personal information submitted on our Site by logging into your account and changing your preferences. You may also contact us directly by using the contact information listed below.

  


##### SECURITY

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as banking/financial information) on our site, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We use 128-bit data security encryption, so all information sent between your web browser and our website remains private and secure.

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20121106234520id_/http%3A//www.transfast.com/contact_us.aspx).

All Trans-Fast employees pass financial and criminal background checks as a condition of employment.

  


##### CHOICES YOU CAN MAKE ABOUT OUR USE OF YOUR INFORMATION
