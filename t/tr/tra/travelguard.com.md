# America's #1 Travel Insurance - Travel Guard

**Secure Transactions**  
To ensure that every transaction is protected, we use advanced encryption technology; we treat your credit card and personal information with the highest standards of confidentiality and safety. 

By making your purchase on our secure server, you are protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, utilized by most popular browsers, including Netscape and Microsoft Explorer. This technology allows us to use advanced encryption tools to protect all important customer information (including your credit card number, name, address, etc.) transmitted between your computer and our server. In the unlikely event of a breach in security, there is no risk to you. In the event of credit card fraud, Travel Guard will reimburse you the first $50 of any fraudulent charges. Since our first website in 1996 we have not had one confirmed case of credit card fraud ([click here for more information on the Travel Guard Warranty and Security](https://web.archive.org/news/security.asp))

**Use of Information**  
Non-personal information is collected to track the total number of guests visiting this site, pages that they visited and time spent on those pages. This information is used in its aggregate form to help us improve our site. This information is used exclusively for our internal purposes. 

Personal information that can identify a visitor, such as name, address or policy information, is collected only when voluntarily offered and solely for purposes of transacting a policy.   
When you make a purchase online with us, we will use your personal and credit card information to process your Travel Guard purchase. There is a chance that we will occasionally share your name and address (never your credit card or financial information) with other approved companies whose products or services we believe may interest you.

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information; we use them only to credit organizations that market our products and to make return visits less labor intensive.   
If you send Travel Guard an e-mail request, we may respond to your request with an e-mail asking for further clarification of your needs, or requesting additional information so that we can best serve you. In addition, a confirmation of your order will be sent to the e-mail address that you provide in our application section. From time to time we might send you an e-mail regarding special product offerings that we think fit your special needs.

**Modification of This Privacy Policy**  
These policies are subject to change and any changes will be posted on this page. You should periodically check for revisions.
