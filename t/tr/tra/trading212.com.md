AVUS CAPITAL is as a Personal Data Controller (Certificate No 318998), registered under the terms of Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and the Data Protection Act (2002).

## Required Data

In order to open an account, we need to collect data to ascertain your identity and our products’ appropriateness to your circumstances. To do this, we request you name, address, date of birth, contact details, etc. We may also request additional information, including, but not limited to, trading statements and employment details. 

This data is requested through our application forms in order to give you the opportunity to use our services and trade with CFDs via our trading platform.

We may also use our own records and information from other sources, if applicable. 

This data will allow us to meet our regulatory obligations. If you choose not to provide some data, we may be unable to give you access to the requested service. 

We keep your data as up-to-date as possible, and update details – such as your address – promptly upon being informed about the change. 

The data is also used by us to provide you with information about our services. 

## Use of Personal Data

The primary purpose of obtaining the data is to create a client account. While you maintain an account with us, we may also use this data for anti-money laundering purposes, to improve our service, to review your needs and to provide you with information we deem relevant.

  * following your instructions or the instructions of a person authorized by you under the Terms of Business.



We require all organisations to whom we disclose personal data or which may obtain it on our behalf to ensure its confidentiality and to handle it in accordance with the legislative requirements.

## How We Store Your Data

The personal data that you provide upon registration as user of the website or the services is classified as “Registered Information.” Registered Information is protected in many ways. You can access your Registered Information through a password selected by you. This password is encrypted and only known to you. Your password must not be revealed to anyone. Registered Information is safely stored on secure servers that can only be accessed by authorised personnel via a password. AVUS CAPITAL encrypts all personal data, thus taking all the necessary measures to prevent unauthorised parties from viewing or accessing it.

Your data will be held on our secure computer systems and paper files. We have systems and procedures to prevent unauthorised access, improper modification or disclosure, misuse or loss of data.

Your data will be kept by us for a period, even if our relationship with you has been discontinued. Once we decide the information is no longer needed, we will destroy it.

## Right of Data Access and/or Amendment 

The right to access and amend data will be granted after submitting an application in writing or by e-mail. Under the Data Protection Act, you may also request a copy of the personal data we hold about you. You may also request us to amend any potential inaccuracies. To provide information, we will need to verify your identity. Your request will be acknowledged and replied to within 14 days from its submission. The period may be extended by up to 30 days, in cases when the collection of the requested data requires a longer period and would seriously impede our activities.

## Legal Disclaimer

AVUS CAPITAL reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by rules and regulations, and when AVUS CAPITAL believes that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served. AVUS CAPITAL will not be liable for the misuse or loss of personal data resulting from cookies on website(s) that AVUS CAPITAL does not have access to or control over. AVUS CAPITAL will not be liable for unlawful or unauthorised use of your personal data due to the misuse or misplacement of your passwords, either negligent or malicious.

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it on a regular basis. In case of amendments to the Privacy Policy, they will be promptly announced in this document, on the website, and wherever else we deem appropriate, so that you will be informed about our approach to data collection, use, and disclosure.
