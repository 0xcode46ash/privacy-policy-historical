This Privacy Statement discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices of TC IP, Ltd., its parent, affiliate, and subsidiary companies (“TransCore”) in connection with the World Wide Web site located at [www.transportationsoftware.com](http://www.transportationsoftware.com/) (collectively, the “Site”). The Site is controlled and operated by TransCore Commercial Services, Inc. from its offices in the United States. This Privacy Statement addresses only TransCore’s practices regarding information collected directly from the Site – it does not address or govern any information gathering or dissemination practices related to information collected by way of other means or media, whether off-line or otherwise. TransCore can be contacted by mail at 11000 SW Stratus Street, Suite 100, Beaverton, Oregon, 97008, by phone at 1.800.547.5417 (within the United States) or 1.503.643.4331(outside the United States), or by e-mail at [inquiries @transcorebusiness.com](mailto:inquiries@transcorebusiness.comtranscore) .

**1\. Collection of Personal Information from Site Visitors**

TransCore may collect or track (1) the home server domain names, e-mail addresses, type of client computer, files downloaded, search engine used, operating system, and type of Web browser of visitors to the Site, (2) the e-mail addresses of visitors that communicate with TransCore via e-mail, (3) information knowingly provided by the visitor in online order forms, sign-up forms, contact forms, online resume submissions, registration forms, surveys, e-mail, and other online avenues (including, without limitation, demographic and personal profile data), and (4) aggregate and user-specific information regarding which pages Site visitors access.

TransCore may place Internet “cookies” on visitors’ hard drives. Internet cookies save data about individual visitors, such as the visitor’s name, password, user-name, shopping cart, screen preferences, and the pages of a site viewed by the visitor. When the visitor revisits the Site, TransCore may recognize the visitor by the Internet cookie and customize the visitor’s experience accordingly. Visitors may decline Internet cookies, if any, by using the appropriate feature of their Web client software, if available.

TransCore also may use Web bugs to gather, store, and track certain information related to your visit to and activity on the Site. A Web “bug” is a file object, which can be a graphic image such as a transparent one pixel-by-one pixel graphics file, which is placed on a Web page or in an e-mail message to monitor user activity. A Web bug can gather, for example, the IP address of your computer, the time the Web page was viewed, and the type of browser used.

When a visitor performs a search within the Site, TransCore may record information identifying the visitor or linking the visitor to the search performed. TransCore may also record limited information for every search request and use that information to solve technical problems with the services available directly or indirectly in connection with the Site and to calculate overall usage statistics.

**2\. Use of Personal Data Collected**

Personal data collected by TransCore may be used by TransCore for many reasons, for example, for editorial and feedback purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, for a statistical analysis of users’ behavior, for product development, for content improvement, for fulfillment of a requested transaction or recordkeeping, or to customize the content and layout of the Site. Aggregate data on visitors’ home servers may be used for internal purposes, and individually identifying information, such as names, postal and e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and other personal information which visitors voluntarily provide to TransCore may be added to TransCore’s databases and used for future calls and mailings regarding Site updates, new products and services, and upcoming events.

TransCore also may use Site visitor data to contact the Site visitors regarding account status and changes to the subscriber agreement, privacy statement, and any other policies or agreements relevant to Site visitors.

**3\. Disclosure of Personal Data to Third Parties**

Aggregate data on visitors' home servers may be provided to marketing, promotion, and similar firms. . Identifiable and non-identifiable visitor information and data which visitors provide to TransCore may be provided to third parties who provide products, information, or services which TransCore believes that visitors may be interested in directly or indirectly purchasing or obtaining. Identifiable or non-identifiable data also may be disclosed or distributed to another party with which TransCore enters or reasonably may enter into a corporate transaction, such as, for example, a merger, consolidation, acquisition, or asset purchase, or to a third party pursuant to a subpoena, other form of legal process, or a request by or on behalf of any local, state, federal, or other government department or agency.

While TransCore may undertake efforts to see that any third party to which TransCore shares, rents, sells, or otherwise discloses personal data is under a contractual obligation to use the personal data solely for the purposes for which the data was disclosed, such third parties are independent third parties over which TransCore exercises no control, and TransCore is not responsible for their conduct, actions, omissions, or information handling or dissemination practices and TransCore will not be liable therefor.

This Site may contain links to other World Wide Web sites or advertisements for or placed by third parties. TransCore is not responsible for the privacy practices of such Web sites, advertisers, or third parties, or for the content of such sites or advertisements. It is possible that these links or advertisements, themselves, may be used by third parties or others to collect personal or other information about Site visitors. It is solely the visitors’ obligation to review and understand the privacy practices and policies of these other Web sites and of these advertisers and third parties.

**4\. Security Measures**

TransCore has implemented numerous security features to prevent the unauthorized release of or access to personal information. For example, employees responsible for operation and maintenance of the Site are asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement. Please be advised, however, that the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to or from TransCore via this Site or e-mail cannot be guaranteed. Accordingly, TransCore is not responsible for the security of information transmitted via the Internet. Instead of communicating with TransCore via e-mail or the Internet, visitors can contact TransCore by mail at 11000 SW Stratus Street, Suite 100, Beaverton, Oregon, 97008, or by phone at1.800.547.5417 (within the United States) or 1.503.643.4331 (outside the United States).
