All personal information collected by the Department of Education and Training (the Department) is protected by the _Privacy Act 1988 (Privacy Act)_. A copy of the Privacy Act can be obtained on [ComLaw](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/) and further information on the _Privacy Act_ can be found on the [Office of the Australian Information Commissioner’s website](http://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-portal/index.html) _._

Information we collect and how we use it

The Commonwealth of Australia, acting through the Department co-ordinates the training.gov.au website.

The Department helps the Australian Government achieve its overall objective of quality educational, employment and training outcomes for all Australians through:

  * efficient national program management;

  * effective working relationships with state and territory governments, education departments, non-government education, science and training authorities, Indigenous education service providers, industry, community groups and other stakeholders;

  * auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services; and

  * policy advice and other support to the Minister.




Generally, the Department collects personal information in order to properly and efficiently carry out its functions (including those listed above), and only uses personal information for the purposes for which it was given to the Department and for directly related purposes (unless otherwise required by or authorised under law).

In addition to this general Privacy Policy, where more detailed information is needed to explain our privacy practices, we publish separate privacy notices to describe how we will handle personal information that we collect.

Communication - emails and Electronic Forms

The training.gov.au servers may record your email address if you send us a message online. Your email address will not be added to a mailing list, unless you have provided it to us in order to subscribe to one of the training.gov.au subscription services.

Where you choose to send us a completed electronic form (for example, when you register as a user on the training.gov.au website) that includes your personal details, we collect personally identifiable information, such as name and email address.

The information collected by email or electronic forms will be used only for the purpose for which you provided it, and we will not disclose it unless one of the circumstances described below under the heading “Information Sharing” has been satisfied.
