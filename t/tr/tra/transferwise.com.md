# TransferWise - Send Money Abroad-Privacy

Dated: 26 July 2016

Transferwise, Inc. is concerned about privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we collect through our websites from which you are accessing this policy, including [www.transferwise.com](http://www.transferwise.com/) (the “ **Websites** ”), through the software applications made available by us for use on or through computers and mobile devices (the “ **Apps** ”), as well as through HTML-formatted email messages that we send to you that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, including the Websites and Apps, the “ **Services** ”). By providing Personal Information to us or using the Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. 

We use information that we collect from or about our customers in accordance with our [Consumer Privacy Notice](http://www.transferwise.com/), which provides choices about our sharing and use of information. 

## Information we may collect about you

We may collect, through the means described here, the following information:

  * **Personal Information you give us.** “Personal Information” is information that identifies you as an individual or relates to an identifiable person. We collect your Personal Information when you provide it to us, such as when you register to use our Services, participate in discussion boards or other social media functions on the Services, enter a competition, promotion or survey, report a problem with our Services or otherwise communicate with us. The Personal Information you give us may include your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, financial information (including credit card, debit card, or bank account information), and social security number. 

We may also need to collect additional commercial and/or identification information from you, such as if you send or receive certain high-value or high volume transactions or as needed to comply with our anti-money laundering or other obligations under applicable law.

If you submit any Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

  * **Other Information we collect.** “Other Information” is information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an individual. We may automatically collect the following information when you use the Services: 

    * Details of the transactions you carry out on when using our Services, including the country from which the transaction originates; 

    * Technical information, including the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, Internet browser type and version, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, and operating system and platform; 

    * Information about your use of the Services, including the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through and from the Services (including date and time); products you viewed or searched for; page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page and any phone number used to call our Customer Support number. 

    * We may aggregate Personal Information. Such aggregated information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Services. For example, we may aggregate Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code. 

  * **Information we receive from other sources.** We work closely with third parties and may receive information about you from them. These third parties may include, for example, banks and payment service providers you use to transfer money to us; banks and payment service providers of your recipient; business partners; sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services; advertising networks; analytics providers; search information providers; credit reference agencies; public databases; and social media platforms. 




## Cookies and Similar Technologies

Our Website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our Website. This helps us to provide you with a good experience and also allows us to improve our Website. Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Website, pages visited, language preferences, and other anonymous traffic data. We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, to personalize your experience while using the Services and to recognize your computer in order to assist your use of the Services. We also gather statistical information about use of the Services in order to continually improve their design and functionality, understand how they are used and assist us with resolving questions regarding them. Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the Services. We may also use cookies or other technologies to track responses to our online advertisements. 

If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site. You may also wish to refer to <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html>. If, however, you do not accept cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer, and you may need to log in every time you visit. 

At this time we do not respond to browser do-not-track signals. 

Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) may be used in connection with the Services to, among other things, track the actions of users (including email recipients), measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Services and response rates. 

We may use third-party analytics providers, such as Google Analytics and Mixpanel, which use cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Services and report on activities and trends.  These third parties may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources.  You can learn about Google’s practices by going to [www.google.com/policies/privacy/‌partners/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/%E2%80%8Cpartners/), and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>.  You can learn about Mixpanel’s practices and how to opt out of them by going to <https://mixpanel.com/terms/>. 

We may use Adobe Flash Local Shared Objects (“Flash LSOs”) and other technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of the Services. If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the [Website Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html). You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the [Global Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html) and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to as “information” on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time). Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including those used in connection with the Services. 

## Third Party Advertisers

To do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser (including through use of pixel tags). They may also use these technologies, along with information they and we collect about your online use, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile phone and a laptop.
