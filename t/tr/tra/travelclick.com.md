Shopping at TRIP.com is safe and secure.

When you visit TRIP.com for your travel needs, we protect you with state-of-the-art Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, which is utilized by most popular browsers, including Netscape and Microsoft Explorer. This technology provides the advanced encryption tools necessary to protect information transmitted between your computer and our server. Encryption simply means that your information is converted into code before it is dispatched over the Internet. 

In addition to SSL technology, we also guarantee:

* Your personal travel profile is password-protected, and it is our policy to never buy or sell this information to or from any third parties without your permission. 
* Our secure server encrypts all personal information, including your name, address, and credit-card information, so that it cannot be read as it is transmitted over the Internet. 

We understand that your personal information is very sensitive. To further protect the information you share with us, we have an exhaustive security system which includes: world-class firewall technologies; logical network segmentation (allowing restricted access to stored profile information); and logical and physical security restrictions to our databases and systems.

We promise to respect your privacy

**

As a member of TRIP.com, you are asked to provide us with some personal information when filling out your travel profile. This information is used primarily so we better understand your travel needs, preferences and requirements. The more information you provide, the more we can personalize our content and services to meet your individual needs. 

Your e-mail address and password are your personal key to modifying your travel profile and providing us with your travel preferences. For example, we will remember that you like a seat on the aisle and that you prefer a non-smoking hotel room. You will not need to remind us each time to come back to book your travel with us.

Before completing your personal profile, please review and accept the [TRIP.com Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/legal/0,1444,1-1,00.html).
