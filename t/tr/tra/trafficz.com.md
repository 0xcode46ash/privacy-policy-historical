**Does Trafficz disclose information to third parties?**  
(a) Traffic or Clickstream Data. Data about traffic and usage is not personally identifying or identifiable, and is not supplemented or combined with personally identifying or identifiable information. Trafficz may share information it collects with certain selected third parties, but only in aggregated, anonymous form. For example, we may tell an advertiser that a certain number of people visited a certain area on our Web site, or searched Web sites for the term "basketball posters." Trafficz collects some information regarding use of the Services by observing browser functions and the files (pages) users access. For example, Trafficz's servers collect information about the site from which you entered to enable Trafficz to calculate and pay its affiliates, information about the most frequently searched terms to help its advertisers provide the most relevant search results, information about usage to check for fraudulent behavior or other abnormalities and to ensure that our Services are technically superior. In addition to the foregoing applications, Trafficz uses the information (in aggregate form) to better design the Services.
