Traffic.com, Inc. ("traffic.com") respects your privacy. We provide this Privacy Statement to answer some of the questions you may have about the types of information we collect from our web site and what we do with the information. By using this site, you signify your assent to the traffic.com Privacy Statement described here. This Privacy Statement is incorporated into and subject to the terms of our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20011217102143id_/http%3A//www.traffic.com/home/html/copyright.html).

#### Types of Information We Collect

In order to measure the usefulness and efficiency of our web site, we automatically track certain information from all visitors to our web site. This information is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis, and we do not generally track anyone's individually identifiable information. The types of information we might track may include the Internet address that you just came from, which Internet address you go to, what browser you are using and your IP address. Like most interactive web sites, we use "cookies" on certain pages of our web site. "Cookies" are small data files that are stored on your hard drive which store certain information accessible to our web site, such as your password and any information content preferences you may voluntarily set at our web site. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on our web site and you may be required to reenter your password more frequently during a session. In some areas of our web site, you can request information about products or services and register to receive updates about our upcoming services. In order for you to request such information, we may require you to provide us with information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information"). Personal Information may include: (i) Contact Data (such as your name, mailing and e-mail addresses); and/or (ii) Demographic Data (such as your zip code, age and income). If you request information about our products or services, communicate with us by e-mail, or otherwise complete online forms or surveys, any information provided in such communication may be collected as Personal Information. 

#### Uses of Information Collected

We will use Personal Information to provide you with the products and services you requested and to better understand your needs. Specifically, we use Personal Information to respond to your requests for information about our company or our products or services. 

#### Sharing of Personal Information

We will not sell or rent any Personal Information about you to any third party. However, in order to offer you a high level of quality products and services, we may share certain Personal Information about you with our affiliates and agents. Rest assured that traffic.com takes all reasonable precautions to ensure that its affiliates and agents respect the privacy of your Personal Information and use it only for its intended purposes. 

#### User Choice Regarding Collection, Use and Distribution of Personal Information

You may choose not to provide us with any Personal Information. In such an event, you can still access and use much of our web site; however you will not be able to access and use those portions of the web site that require your Personal Information. __

#### Confidentiality and Security of Personal Information

Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Statement, we will keep your Personal Information private and will not share it with third parties, unless such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with a court order or other legal process; (b) protect our rights or property; or (c) enforce our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20011217102143id_/http%3A//www.traffic.com/home/html/copyright.html). We will take reasonable measures which we believe are necessary to protect your information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction, and, where possible, will try to ensure that any third parties to whom we may transfer your information take comparable steps to protect its security. 

#### User Ability to Access, Update and Correct Personal Information

In order to request a review of your Personal Information, to notify us of changes to your Personal Information, or to request that some or all of your Personal Information be removed, you may email us at [info@traffic.com](mailto:info@traffic.com). We may retain in our files information you have requested to remove in some circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20011217102143id_/http%3A//www.traffic.com/home/html/copyright.html). Further, such prior information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical constraints and the fact that we back up our systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your Personal Information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests. 

#### Other Limits to Your Privacy

Our web site may contain links to other web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other web sites.
