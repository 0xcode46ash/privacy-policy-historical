## C) **Flights**

  20. ### Licensed Travel Agent

All flight bookings are administered by us as a licensed Travel Agent (No 2TA4656) under the NSW Travel Agents Act 1986 and a member of the Travel Compensation Fund.



  21. ### Your booking with the airline

A booking placed on the Site is an offer to purchase the relevant fare/s. We will send a booking acknowledgement email to advise you that your request has been received and is being processed. A contract for the flight product arises directly between you and the airline when we send you a confirmation e-mail and itinerary indicating that your booking has been accepted. It is not until you receive a booking confirmation email from us that your seats are booked and paid and your booking with the airline is finalised. The onus rests on you to carefully check and correct any mistakes in your reservation request and in any confirmation thereof received from the airline via us.



  22. ### Booking fee

We charge a booking fee as set out in our [Fees Schedule](https://web.archive.org/info/booking-fees.html). The booking fee will automatically be charged upon completion of the booking. The booking fee is non-refundable.



  23. ### Airline flight rules

For each booking there are additional airline flight (or fare) rules which are specific to that flight. They may, for example, state that the ticket is non-cancellable or non-refundable, and have other information relating to itinerary and refunds. You should read the flight rules for each ticket. You can find the relevant flight rules on the Site when you progress through the booking path. You are responsible for complying with the airline's rules in relation to check-in times, reconfirmation of flights or other matters. We accept no responsibility for any issue arising due to non-compliance with rules set by the airline.



  24. ### Fare and taxes

The flight fare price, taxes and booking fee as displayed in the booking summary are added together to form your final quotation. Prices displayed include pre-paid taxes only where specified and are subject to airline availability. Some taxes and surcharges are not pre-payable; it is your responsibility to pay these to the airline when required. Fares and taxes are subject to change and are not guaranteed until you receive a confirmation e-mail when your credit card will be charged. Any fare or tax change will be notified to you prior to you completing the booking. Upon successful confirmation you will be charged the booking price which is displayed in your final booking summary immediately before you click "Book and Pay". Airline fare conditions and class of travel can change at any time. Routing restrictions and other special conditions may apply.



  25. ### Passport/ID, visa and health requirements

These are the responsibility of all individual travellers. For domestic flights the name of the booked passenger must match the passenger's photo ID provided at check-in. Passports are required for all travellers departing Australia. Permanent residents travelling on a foreign passport must hold an Australian Re-entry Visa. When you make an international flight or holiday booking it is your responsibility to ensure that the booking name appears exactly as it does in your passport and we take no responsibility for names entered in any variation other than what is on your passport and in the same order. Your are responsible for ensuring that you meet the passport, visa, health requirements of the countries you wish to visit and those that you transit (even if it is for a plane change). Many countries require that your passport should be valid for a period of (a minimum) six months from the date of arrival into that country. We will not accept any responsibility if you should be denied boarding or deported due to non-fulfillment of the above. You must ensure your Australian passport has a validity of six months after your return date to Australia. In the event that you are travelling to a country or countries which do not require a visa for Australian passport holders, you must tell us if you have been arrested or convicted in respect of any offence or breach of law. Non disclosure of this information may lead to your being refused entry on arrival in certain countries. In that event, we take no responsibility whatsoever. If you do not wish to disclose such information to us, then you must contact the embassy of each country of destination and make your own arrangements in regard to entry to that country. You are responsible for meeting each country's documentation requirements current at the time of travel.



  26. ### Flight reconfirmation

All onward and return flights must be reconfirmed with the relevant airline at least 72 hours prior to the commencement of that leg of the journey unless specifically informed otherwise by that airline. We also take no responsibility for any flight rescheduling en route.



  27. ### Authority

In the event that an accident, disaster or emergency is reported to have occurred in a country where you will or may be travelling, you authorise us to disclose to the Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade details of your itinerary (including without limitation, transport and accommodation arrangements) and your contact details within Australia and overseas.



  28. ### Cancellations and amendments

The airline's policy on cancellations and amendments will be displayed on the booking page. If you need to change or cancel your flight, it is your responsibility to [Contact Us](mailto:customercentral@travel.com.au) as soon as possible. This enables us to attempt to cancel your reservation with the airline. Some tickets are non-refundable, but can be applied (for a limited time) toward future travel, less any applicable penalties. Some tickets do not allow changes. In the majority of cases airlines will charge a cancellation fee (in some instances this may be 100% of the fare). In addition we will charge a per person administration fee for cancelled flights as set out in our [Fees Schedule](https://web.archive.org/info/booking-fees.html). Airline refunds may take up to 12 weeks to be processed by the airline and this is beyond our control. Where refunds are due to you directly from an airline, we will provide reasonable assistance to you in claiming the refund from the airline.
