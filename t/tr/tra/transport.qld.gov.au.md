# Privacy (Department of Transport and Main Roads)

## Privacy and security statement

### Respecting your privacy

The _Information Privacy Act 2009_ (IP Act) regulates the way in which Queensland government agencies must manage personal information.  It addresses concerns about any unauthorised use of this information and gives individuals a right of access to personal information held about them. 

Like other Queensland government agencies, the Department of Transport and Main Roads (TMR) is required to comply with eleven (11) Information Privacy Principles (IPPs) contained in the IP Act. These IPPs set out how personal information must be collected, stored, used and disclosed.

The IP Act defines personal information as:

> _..”information or an opinion, including information or an opinion forming part of a database, whether true or not and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained, from the information or opinion.”_

For information to be personal information two criteria must be satisfied.

  1. It must be about a living individual. 
  2. The individual’s identity must be apparent or reasonably ascertainable from the information.
