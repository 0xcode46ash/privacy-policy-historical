# Privacy Policy | TransPerfect

**EU Standard Contractual Clauses (Processors) and the Privacy Shield**

As part of its overall global privacy compliance efforts, TransPerfect has elected to adhere to enforcing the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (Processors) and the Privacy Shield concerning the transfer of personal identifiable data from the European Union to the United States of America. TransPerfect also applies the same principles to data received from Switzerland.

TransPerfect complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States.  TransPerfect has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>

The term “processing” of personal data includes any operation or set of operations performed upon personal data such as collecting, storing, retrieving, consulting, using, disclosing, disseminating, and otherwise making available the personal data.

This Privacy Policy may change from time to time based on changes made to the EU Standard Contractual Clauses and/or the Privacy Shield. Any changes made necessary will be reflected in an update to this policy and disseminated.

TransPerfect’s privacy practices are self-certified and reflect current guidance concerning the optimal manner of reaching data privacy compliance in accordance with current legal and regulatory guidance.

**Independent recourses for privacy complaints**

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, TransPerfect commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information.  EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Private Shield policy should first contact our Privacy Officers, Roy Trujillo and/or Shigeru Watanabe, at ([privacy@transperfect.com](mailto:privacy@transperfect.com)) or by telephone at +1-212-689-5555 x 1494.

You may file complaints via a online form ([click here](https://web.archive.org/privacy-policy-file-compliance-issue))

TransPerfect is committed to resolve all complaints in timely manner. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us (to be acknowledged within 45 days of receipt), or if you are not satisfied with our response, or if contacting us does not resolve your complaint, EU individuals may request TransPerfect to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to, or you may bring a complaint before, the United States Council for International Business ([USCIB](http://www.uscib.org/privacy-shield/)). The USCIB is the American affiliate of the International Chamber of Commerce, the Business and Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD, and the International Organization of Employers, and has agreed to act as a trusted third party on behalf of the European Union (EU) Data Protection Authorities. Information about how to file a complaint before the USCIB can be found at uscib.org. As a last resort, EU individuals may seek redress through binding arbitration. The services of this process are provided at no cost to you.

**Scope** – This Privacy Policy applies to all personal information received by TransPerfect in any format. TransPerfect will ensure all global data handled by our offices conforms to this Privacy Policy.

**Notice** – TransPerfect treats all material sent to us from our clients, vendors, and employees (collectively, “CVEs”) as confidential in accordance with its current confidentiality undertakings with CVEs. Confidentiality provisions are required as part of all of our contracts with all of our clients vendors and employees; each separate entity must sign a confidentiality agreement prior to becoming affiliated or working with TransPerfect.

TransPerfect maintains Personal Data regarding CVEs on secure systems. This information is collected to aid TransPerfect in conducting business operations. In addition to the Personal Data itself, the information which TransPerfect protects includes contact details, billing/invoicing/payment information, services provided to our clients, and information within source and reference files sent to perform translation projects. In regards to our employees and vendors, this information may also include contact details, payment information, professional qualifications, financial information, and information provided by the employee or vendor in its resume or curriculum vitae (“CV”). When requested by a client and permitted under applicable law, TransPerfect may also cause criminal background checks to be conducted on all employees as well as seek such information concerning key vendors or consultants who may be retained by them. If criminal background checks are needed by clients for our vendors, TransPerfect may accommodate this request if permitted under local law and for an additional fee. Please discuss with your Client Services Representative if needed.

TransPerfect does not rent, sell, loan or otherwise make available Personal Data to any third party unless required by law or in the scope of a registrar, regulatory, or financial audit.

When any clients visit TransPerfect’s website, TransPerfect does not track Personal Data, names or email addresses. Instead, TransPerfect only tracks which Internet Service Provider has accessed the site as well as statistics that show the number of site visitors, those requests received and the country origin of those requests. This information is used to improve our site in order to better serve our clients, but this information does not constitute Personal Data.

All emails sent to TransPerfect (globally) are routed through a third party SPAM filter (AppRiver) which is located in the United States. This means all email correspondence originated outside of the United States with an end destination other than the United States still must travel through the United States before arrival at the desired location.

TransPerfect utilizes a network of over 4,000 freelance vendors to assist in the process of translation. They may receive, as part of the assignment, the name of the client they are working on but no Personal Data about that client, unless such contact information is needed to perform the assignment (such as the cases of onsite interpretation projects, onsite document review, etc.). These freelance vendors may also have access to any Personal Data within the source documents and reference material sent to them for translation. However, in all cases, the freelance vendors will be subject to confidentiality undertakings in which such freelance vendors undertake to keep such information confidential and only use such information in accordance with their projects.  All vendors who will be processing Personal Data are also required to sign the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.

In addition, all vendors are required to sign an EU Data Protection Agreement prior to working with TransPerfect. This document addresses common requirements concerning Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Access, Security, Data Integrity and Enforcement of the Personal Data with respect to the vendor’s Personal Data. Any vendor has the right to terminate its working relationship with TransPerfect and request the deletion of Personal Data pertaining to them. However, TransPerfect will continue to maintain its historical business records in such a way so that TransPerfect may retain its historical knowledge and relationships concerning any legal or regulatory inquiries which may later arise. This practice is in the best interests of both parties so that identifying information relating to a particular matter is accessible but sufficiently discrete so that TransPerfect does not accidentally contact them for projects in the future.

**Choice** – TransPerfect’s clients have the choice concerning what Personal Data is accessed, used or retained. In order to conduct business with our clients it is necessary to maintain contact information and specific billing information, but the extent of the information stored can always be discussed with a TransPerfect Client Services Representative. Additionally, if there is a specific concern about the Personal Data found in the information provided to process a language services project (such as source, reference material, etc.), we recommend redacting this information prior to sending it to TransPerfect or discussing alternative solutions with your TransPerfect Client Services Representative. In addition, other steps may be taken which may include the forced anonymization of information and limitation of translation efforts to de-identified data only.

In order to better serve our client’s needs and provide further information concerning services, TransPerfect may, from time-to-time, send information on additional services we provide. Should any client decide that this information is not desirable, a client may opt-out of receiving this information by informing their Client Services Representative or by contacting the TransPerfect Privacy Officer.

TransPerfect employees have a choice concerning what information is shared with other employees, affiliates and third parties (such as clients). Such information will only be provided pursuant to such employees written consent and not used for any other purpose.

**Onward Transfer** – TransPerfect will obtain assurances from employees and vendors that they will safeguard Personal Data consistent with our Privacy Policy. TransPerfect will take all steps in accordance with the Privacy Policy to prevent, contain, or stop disclosure contrary to such entity’s confidentiality obligations.

**Access and Correction** – Any individual CVE may request a copy of the Personal Data TransPerfect has collected from TransPerfect’s Privacy Officer in accordance with applicable law, in addition to receiving confirmation of the contents of any Personal Data relating to the individual. Under applicable law, such individual CVE then has the right to correct, amend or delete information when it is inaccurate.

Clients may do so by contacting their Client Services Representative or by contacting the TransPerfect Privacy Officer.

Except as may be required by law or during a registrar or regulatory audit, TransPerfect will not provide this data to a third party without the consent of the CVE.

Vendors can do so by contacting [EDPA@transperfect.com](mailto:EDPA@transperfect.com), a dedicated e-mail address to which such inquiries can be sent directly.

Employees can do so by contacting the TransPerfect Human Resources department or the TransPerfect Privacy Officer.

**Data Integrity** – TransPerfect is dedicated to ensuring that all data maintained is accurate, updated, and relevant for the use contemplated by the CVE and will take all required steps to ensure the data is accurate, complete and current. This process is accomplished by regular email and written correspondence with CVEs; however, it is highly recommended that CVEs continue to monitor the information provided to TransPerfect and remain proactive with requesting access to any Personal Data and advising TransPerfect of the need for corrections as needed.

**Data Security** – TransPerfect has strict physical and logical security procedures to ensure that all digital and paper records are secured (such policy is available for dissemination to clients upon written request to the TransPerfect Privacy Officer). These records are accessible only by approved staff. All critical systems (e.g., servers) are accessible only by a small number of authorized staff. TransPerfect’s information security is managed internally and is routinely audited to ensure conformity with TransPerfect procedures and recommended industry standards.

**Enforcement** – TransPerfect undertakes to verify compliance with its Privacy Policy not less than once per year and in connection with TransPerfect’s annual review and internal compliance measures. TransPerfect will use its best commercial efforts to ensure that compliance with this Privacy Policy is maintained and that the Privacy Policy is accurate, comprehensive, and continues to conform to applicable law. We encourage CVEs to raise and discuss any issues or concerns with TransPerfect’s Privacy Officer directly who address and resolve such complaints regarding the use of data and noncompliance with our Privacy Policy. All issues will be officially documented within the framework of our ISO 9001 certified quality management system.

TransPerfect provides information regarding the below through policies and trainings:

  * TransPerfect is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
  * The possibility, under certain conditions, for the individual to invoke binding arbitration
  * The requirement for your organization to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements
  * TransPerfect’s liability in cases of onward transfers to third parties



With respect to complaints related to our Privacy Policy that cannot be resolved through our internal process, we agree to abide by the dispute resolution procedures established by the Privacy Shield framework.
