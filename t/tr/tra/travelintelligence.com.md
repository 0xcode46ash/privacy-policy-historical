# Privacy Policy

## Privacy Policy and Other personal information

## Privacy Policy

Travel Intelligence LTD, trading as travelintelligence.com and travelintelligence.net (TI), respects your right to the privacy of the personal information you provide us on our website. TI takes your privacy very seriously, and complies with UK data protection law. Unless you specify otherwise or we state otherwise in this policy or at the time information is collected, any personal information you provide to TI will not be divulged to third parties outside the TI group of companies (including all subsidiary or holding companies) without your permission unless where required by law. However, we may make use of your personal details in the following ways:

1\. We collect basic technical information about visitors to our site, in particular the gateway from which they have accessed the site and the pages they are looking at. In part we do this in order to calculate royalties we pay our authors - so if you like a particular writer's work, do them a favour - read it! We may group this data in a way which can be shared with third parties, but we will not disclose your identity or personally identifiable information about you without your permission. 

2\. We use 'cookies' to enable us to register you for access to certain parts of the site, to identify unique users, and to track usage. Cookies are small data files which we send to your computer to enable you to access the site without having to subscribe again. Other companies represented on our site - i.e. advertisers or partners - may do the same thing; however we cannot control these, and you should read their privacy policy. But remember, cookies can only identify machines - not individuals. 

3\. Lastly, we collect email details in order to distribute newsletters and announcements about TI, but we will not share them with third parties. Where we ask for email addresses in the 'e-mail a friend' feature, this is purely a convenience measure - these addresses are not stored, nor shared with anyone.

## Other personal information

The only personal information we may make public about you is that which you choose to submit when you contribute material to us. This is asked for on a voluntary basis purely as a way to tell others a little bit about the source of the material, but will not include your email address nor any other contact details except where you have given us your permission.

By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of this information by TI. If we change our privacy policy we will inform you by posting any amendments on this page.

TI reserves the right to modify these Terms of Use and its Privacy Policy, and continuing access to the Site will be subject to those then current. We suggest you check these pages at regular intervals if using the Site.

The information, documentation and data ("Information") contained in this site has been prepared solely for the purpose of providing information about Travel Intelligence Limited and the services that it offers. We try to ensure that information contained on the site is accurate and up to date. However you should always verify the information before relying on it and we do not warrant or give any representations as to its accuracy. Travel Intelligence Limited shall not be liable for any loss which may arise from the use of the Information.

These Terms of Use govern the use of the Site.
