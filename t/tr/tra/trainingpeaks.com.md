We require that these third parties agree to use the Information we share with them only to perform their obligations to us and to treat all Information they receive from us in compliance with this Policy.

Once we generate any Non-Personal Information from any Personal Information, we will not later attempt to again make that information personally identifiable.

Provided that any Non-Personal Information remains in non-personally identifiable form and may not be reasonably associated with, linked to, or used to identify any individual, we may use or share that Non-Personal Information for any lawful purpose without a further duty or obligation to you.

### Business Transfers.

If we elect, in our reasonable discretion, to transfer ownership or control of the Site to a third party, whether or not in the context of an acquisition, merger, or reorganization, your Information (both Personal and Non-Personal) may be transferred to that third party (either an affiliate or an unrelated third party). If such a transfer occurs, the acquiring company's use of your personal information will still be subject to this Policy and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.

### Your California Privacy Rights.

California law provides that California residents have a right to request that businesses tell them how their Personal Information has been shared with third parties for use in direct marketing purposes. However, there is an exception to this requirement for businesses that have adopted and disclosed, in their privacy policy, a policy of not disclosing a person’s Personal Information to third parties for use in direct marketing purposes if that person has exercised an option to opt-out of the disclosure of their Personal Information to third parties for such purposes.

We have adopted a policy of allowing you to opt-out of the disclosure of your Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes and thus falls within this exception. Instructions for opting out can be found in the section below entitled “Your Choices / Opt-Out / Changing Your Information.”

### Your Choices / Opt-Out /Changing / Deleting Your Personal Information.

We respect your right to make choices about the ways we receive, collect, use and disclose your Personal Information. If you no longer wish to receive messages from us through the Site, or to have your Personal Information shared with third parties as permitted by this Policy, you may opt-out of receiving those messages from us or having your Personal Information shared with third parties.

In many cases, opting out of receiving messages or having your Personal Information shared with a third party will not affect your ability to use or access the Site. However, some messages (e.g. account notifications, service announcements, and billing information) are considered necessary to our operation of the Site. Likewise, some of the third parties with which we share your Personal Information are used by us to provide necessary functionality for the Site. If you wish to opt-out of receiving these messages or of sharing your Personal Information with those third parties, we may be required to limit or cancel your access to and use of some or all of our Site. Note also that while you may opt-out of receiving messages from us, you may be required to contact other third parties directly to also opt-out of receiving emails or other messages from those third parties. All opt-out requests can be made by contacting us at [support@peaksware.com](mailto:support@peaksware.com) using the email address we have on file for your account on the Site.

While we take reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Information we collect is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current, we rely on you to update and correct your Personal Information. You may update, correct or modify any of your Personal Information by emailing us at [support@peaksware.com](mailto:support@peaksware.com) using the email address we have on file for your account on the Site.

### Children's Privacy.

The Site is not directed at nor targeted to children under the age of 13. We do not use the Site to knowingly solicit Personal Information from or market to children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, do not provide us with any Personal Information.

### Do Not Track.

Certain web browsers and other devices you may use to access the Site may permit you to indicate your preference that you do not wish to be “tracked” online. At this time we do not modify your experience on the Site or the Information we collect from you through the Site based on whether such a preference is indicated.

### Security.

We are committed to protect and secure your Personal Information. We will take all reasonable and appropriate steps to insure the safety and security of your Personal Information. This includes using at least industry standard security measures to protect the loss, misuse, and unintended alteration of the Personal Information under our control. For example, our policy is that only those individuals who need your Personal Information to perform a specific job for us are granted access to that Personal Information. Likewise, all employees and contractors are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment. Although we take these measures to protect your Personal Information, "perfect security" does not exist, and we can not guarantee that your Personal Information will be secure in all situations.
