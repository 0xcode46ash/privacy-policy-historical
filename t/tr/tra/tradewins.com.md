**Security and Confidentiality of Personal Information**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of Personal Information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures which we regard as appropriate to safeguard and secure the Personal Information we collect online. 

We use encryption technology to protect the security of the information collected and transmitted on our website. When our registration and order forms ask users to enter sensitive Personal Information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software currently available in the industry, which is known as SSL. 

In addition, your TradeWins Publishing Account Information is password-protected for your protection. After a successful login, you can change your password at your discretion. TradeWins Publishing recommends that you choose a password that would be difficult to guess, that you change your password periodically and that you keep your password secret (including by not allowing friends or family members to use your account and password). You acknowledge that you are responsible for selecting a password and maintaining its secrecy. Under no circumstances will TradeWins Publishing be liable to you or any third party for your failure to maintain the secrecy of your password. 

**No Liability for Acts of Third Parties**

Although we will use reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of the Personal Information you submit, transmissions made by means of the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure. TradeWins Publishing will have no liability for disclosure of information and data you submit to us due to errors in transmission, unauthorized acts of third parties or through the use of third party cookies, programs, routines, viruses or other devices on your computer.
