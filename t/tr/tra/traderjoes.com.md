# Trader Joe's: Choosing and Using Our Products

Trader Joe's Privacy Policy

Here at Trader Joe's, the privacy of our customers is of the utmost concern to us. We will never collect information for the purpose of sharing or selling it to unaffiliated third party companies. We sell food, not information about our customers.

And so, we also don’t use cookies on this website. A cookie is a small data file that websites often store on your computer’s hard drive when you visit their sites. A cookie may contain information (such as a unique user ID) that is used to track the pages of the sites you’ve visited. Again, we like to take bites of cookies - not bytes of cookies.

Any information we do collect is an effort to help us improve your shopping adventure and make us a better Trader Joe's.

Periodically we’ll ask our customers to provide their zip code. This is for internal marketing purposes only and it helps us to know if we’re providing the best coverage for our [Fearless Flyer](https://web.archive.org/web/20051213203400id_/http%3A//traderjoes.com/fearless/index.asp).

By signing up for our email newsletter, customers agree to allow Trader Joe's to send information via email about Trader Joe's products, store grand openings and other information of interest. Customers who no longer wish to receive the email newsletter may remove their email addresses at [traderjoes.com/signup](https://web.archive.org/web/20051213203400id_/http%3A//traderjoes.com/signup/index.asp).
