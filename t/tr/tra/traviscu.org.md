To protect your privacy, we work only with companies that agree to maintain strong confidentiality protections and limit the use of information that we provide. All agreements with other companies, including joint marketing agreements, contain required confidentiality clauses that prohibit these companies from selling the information we provide to them to other third parties and require them to safeguard the information while in their possession. We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who have a specific business in utilizing your data. Our employees are trained in the importance of maintaining confidentiality and customer privacy.

Safeguarding Your Own Privacy

**  
Each individual also has a responsibility to safeguard their financial information. Protect your account numbers, PINs (personal identification numbers) and passwords. Never keep your PIN with your debit, ATM or credit card, which could provide access to your accounts if your card is lost or stolen. Use caution when disclosing your account numbers, social security numbers, etc. to other persons. If someone calls you, explains the call is on behalf of the credit union and asks for your account number, do not divulge that information. Official credit union staff will have access to your information and will not need to ask for it. Keep your information current. We need to have current information on how to reach you. If we detect or suspect possible fraudulent or unauthorized activity or use of an account, we need to be able to contact you.
