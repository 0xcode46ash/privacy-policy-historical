Information Collection and Use 

TravelManagement.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent personally identifiable information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. TravelManagement.com collects information from our users at several different points on our websites. 

Registration 

In order to use the websites, a user must first complete a registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our sites for which they have expressed interest. 

Job Orders 

On the TravelJobs.com, we request information from the user on our job request form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and business address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill job orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. 

Cookies 

TravelManagement.com does not use cookies on any of its sites. Some of the business partners on our site use cookies (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. 

Sharing 

TravelManagement.com reserves the right to share or sell aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

We may use an outside company for credit card processing when billing users for services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

We partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. 

These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. 

Links 

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we TravelManagement.com are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

Newsletter 

If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as email address. 

Polls & Contests 

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via polls or contests. Participation in these polls or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Poll information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Poll information is also used to increase and share the knowledge base among professionals in the travel industry. 

Security 

This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our registration forms asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card or employment history), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or database administrators) are granted access to personally identifiable information. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage. 

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [webmaster@travelmanagement.com.](mailto:webmaster@travelmanagement.com)

Notification of Changes 

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email.
