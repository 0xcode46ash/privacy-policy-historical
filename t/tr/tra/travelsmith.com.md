To better serve you and to enhance your shopping experience, we may supplement the information listed above with data that is publicly available and with data we receive from other reputable sources whose privacy policies meet the Direct Marketing Association's requirements.

**What is TravelSmith's policy on sending promotional e-mail?**  
If you have requested to receive promotional e-mails from TravelSmith, we may send you e-mail to offer you our best and most current shopping opportunities. If when placing your order or catalog request online, you have already requested not to receive e-mails, you do not need to send us an additional request. 

We do not send "SPAM", or unsolicited commercial e-mail, from our systems. If we receive a "SPAM" complaint about one of our promotional e-mail campaigns, we will communicate this complaint to our e-mail delivery provider. If you receive unwanted, unsolicited e-mail sent via our delivery system or purporting to be sent via our system, please forward a copy of that e-mail with your comments to [service@travelsmith.com](mailto:service@travelsmith.com) for review.
