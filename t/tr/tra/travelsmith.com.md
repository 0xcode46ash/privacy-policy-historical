TravelSmith Privacy Policy

**We are committed to providing a safe and secure shopping experience, and we respect and protect your personal information.** Any information collected at travelsmith.com is used solely for the purpose of improving our services for you. 

**Collected Information  
Non-Personally Identifiable Information: **We track and analyze non-personally identifiable information on our site in order to find problems and improve our service. 

**Personal Information:** We collect information such as your name, billing and shipping addresses, phone number, email address, and credit-card information in order to process your orders with us. When you set up an online account with us, we request a password to allow you secure access. 

We use the information we receive to process and track your orders, send catalogs you have requested and mailings that may be of interest to you, provided you have not requested otherwise, and send order and shipping confirmation e-mails. 

**Protecting Your Information**   
We use encryption and/or physical, procedural, and electronic security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of data used by our system. 

**Email and Phone Privacy**   
We will never release your email or phone numbers to anyone else. You may join or unsubscribe from TravelSmith emails at any time. 

TravelSmith does not rent or sell email addresses or phone numbers to third parties. 

We will only use your email address to communicate with you about the status of your order, unless you specify that you would like to receive special offers by email. If you sign up for these offers, you can remove your name from our list at any time. 

We will use your phone number to communicate with you about your order if we are unable to reach you by email. 

**Promotional Emails**   
If you have requested to receive promotional emails from TravelSmith, we may send you email to offer you our best and most current shopping opportunities, exclusive offers, and web-only sales. If when placing your order or catalog request online, you have already requested not to receive emails, you do not need to send us an additional request. 

We do not send SPAM (unsolicited commercial email) from our systems. If we receive a SPAM complaint about one of our promotional email campaigns, we will communicate this complaint to our email delivery provider. If you receive unwanted, unsolicited email sent via our delivery system or purporting to be sent via our system, please forward a copy of that email with your comments to service@travelsmith.com for review. 

**Unsubscribing from Email**   
Every email message sent through our system contains a link to a webpage where you can request to stop receiving email from us. You can also send an email to service@travelsmith.com with "No Emails" in the subject line and your name and mailing address in the body of the email. Finally, you can also call 800-950-1600 and request to be taken off of our promotional email list. 

**Information Supplied To, or Received From, Third Parties**   
To better serve you and to enhance your shopping experience, we may supplement the information listed above with data that is publicly available and with data we receive from other reputable sources whose privacy policies meet the Direct Marketing Association's requirements. From time to time, we may share our postal mailing list with carefully selected providers of goods and services that may be of interest to you provided you have not requested otherwise (If you prefer not to receive mailings from these providers, you can notify us at any time). Also, on rare occasions, we may disclose specific information upon governmental request in order to assist with fraud protection or investigation. Information is not provided to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes. 

TravelSmith does not sell, trade, or rent your email address.

**Unsubscribe from Catalog Mailing List**   
If you no longer wish to receive our catalog you can send an email to service@travelsmith.com with "No Catalogs" in the subject line and your name and address in the body of the email. You can also call 800-950-1600 and request to be taken off of our catalog mailing list. Because we plan our mailings in advance, it may take several weeks for your request to become effective. 

**Request Mailing Information Not be Shared**   
From time to time, we may share our postal mailing list with carefully selected providers of goods and services that may be of interest to you provided you have not requested otherwise. If you do not wish to receive these offers, you can send an email to service@travelsmith.com with "Do Not Share" in the subject line and your name and address in the body of the email.
