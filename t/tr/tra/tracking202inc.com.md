# Privacy Policy

#### **General**

Tracking202 values the privacy of its users. Tracking202 will not provide any information about its users and/or their traffic data to any third party company for any purpose, unless required to do so by law. 

#### **Notice to visitors of your web site**

The internet is not anonymous, and no one should expect their browsing habits to be private. However, it is considered good form to post a notice on your web site that you are using tracking software (Tracking202 or otherwise) to monitor the visitors to your web site. You agree to indemnify Tracking202 against any and all damages resulting from your failure to post such a notice. 

#### **General statistics**

From time to time, Tracking202 may release statistical reports of the traffic trends for sites registered with the Service, such as web browser usage or geolocation data. These reports are of a general nature and will not contain any information that can be linked to any one person or web site. 

#### **License**

Tracking202 hereby grants you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to include the Company-provided JavaScript ("Script") in the HTML code for web page(s) that are properly registered for the Service and owned by you, solely for the purpose of accessing the Service and information available from the Service with respect to such web page(s). You shall not (i) use, reproduce, modify or create derivative works of the Script, (ii) host the Script code on your own servers, or (iii) allow third party access to all or any portion of the Script or Service. 

#### **Account**

You must register an account to use the Service. You agree not to share your account username and password with third parties, and to notify the Company immediately of any unauthorized usage. 

#### **Data**

By using the Service, you agree to allow Tracking202 to collect and store data on your web site traffic. Tracking202 may randomly use your traffic data for internal feature development and bug fixing purposes. Otherwise, your data is treated as private and confidential, unless you elect to make it publicly accessible. Tracking202 also monitors the traffic levels of all registered sites on a regular basis, to ensure no site is putting an unnecessary burden on its resources. 

In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information:

  * **Information you provide** \- When you sign up for a free registered user account, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an account password).
  * **Cookies** \- When you visit Tracking202.com, we may or may not send one or more cookies - a small file containing a string of characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends, such as how people use our site. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.
  * **Log information** \- When you use Tracking202.com services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
  * **User communications** \- When you send email or other communication to Tracking202.com, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests, and improve our services.
  * **Affiliated sites** \- We offer some of our services in connection with other websites. Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to Tracking202.com in order to deliver the service. We process such information in accordance with this Policy. The affiliated sites may have different privacy practice and we encourage you to read their privacy policies.



#### **Choices for Personal Information**

When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.

If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent.

You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case Tracking202.com may not be able to provide those services to you.

#### **Information sharing**

Tracking202.com only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Tracking202.com in the following limited circumstances:

  * We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.
  * We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures
  * We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms and Conditions including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Tracking202.com, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.



If Tracking202.com becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who used our site for a particular reason, for example, to view our hairstyle charts.

Please contact us using our contact form for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data.

#### **Information Security**

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.

We restrict access to personal information to Tracking202.com staff only, who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our services.

#### **Data integrity**

Tracking202.com processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.

#### **Accessing and updating personal information**

When you use Tracking202.com services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users� personal information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services.

#### **Enforcement**

Tracking202.com will try to regularly review its compliance with this Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Policy by contacting us through our contact form or by email us at support@tracking202.com. When we receive formal written complaints, it is Tracking202.com�s policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Tracking202.com and an individual.

#### **Changes to this Policy**

Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Policy changes).

#### **Cancellation**

Tracking202 may cancel or delete any account, for any reason, with or without notice. If you wish to cancel your account, you must notify Tracking202 by email to support@tracking202.com.
