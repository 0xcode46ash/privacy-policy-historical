# Travelex Privacy Policy

### Privacy Statement

This website ("Website") is operated by Travelex UK Limited on behalf of itself and its holding companies, subsidiaries and affiliates (together, "Travelex" or "us" or "our"). Travelex recognises the importance of safeguarding the email addresses and other personal information of our customers. The following Privacy Policy sets out the basis on which any personal information will be processed by us and reflect Travelex's commitment to maintaining the confidentiality of personal information and to providing users of the Website with the best possible service.

### When is Personal Information Collected?

  5. we may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them.



### Use and Retention of Personal Information

We use personal information only for the purpose for which we tell you that it has been collected, and for other legitimate purposes as permitted by the Data Protection Act 1998 (the “Act”) and other relevant laws, and retain it only as long as necessary for those uses. If you provide information when buying travel money or other goods or services from Travelex, we may use the personal information for the purposes of:

  6. complying with our legal and regulatory obligations; and

We will not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our Website users. We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target. We may make use of the personal information we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers’ wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.

### Maintenance of Accurate Information

We strive to make sure that the information we maintain about our customers is accurate, current and complete and we respond to requests to correct inaccurate information in a timely manner.

### Protection of Information Via Established Security Procedures

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted to the Website. However, once we receive your information, we use strict security standards and procedures to try to prevent unauthorised access to customer information. Your order is placed over a secure connection and your personal information is encrypted to ensure your data remains safe at all times.

We may disclose your personal information to any member of the Travelex group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the Companies Act 2006. Travelex will not share personal information with third parties outside of the Travelex group for marketing purposes without your consent.

We may disclose your personal information to third parties for the following purposes: 

  1. in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal information to the prospective seller or buyer of such business assets;
  2. if Travelex or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal information held by us about our customers will be one of the transferred assets; and
  3. if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with our legal obligations or in order to enforce our Online Terms and Conditions and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Travelex, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
