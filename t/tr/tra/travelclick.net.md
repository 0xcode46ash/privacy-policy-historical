# TravelCLICK | Privacy Policy

TravelCLICK, Inc. strives to offer our users and customers the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience.   At the same time, we are committed to protecting your privacy and safeguarding your personal information from disclosure to the public.  In order to maintain the highest standards of data privacy and protection, we adhere to the Safe Harbor Principles of the United States Department of Commerce (“the Principles”).  Our compliance with the Safe Harbor Principles means that we exceed the United States legal standards for data privacy and protection and meet the more rigorous legal standards observed in the European Economic Area.

Notice  
Individuals using our services submit information to us voluntarily when making a reservation through a travel agent or call center or by entering information online.  This personal data includes an individual’s name, address, phone number and e-mail address.  We do not collect sensitive information or any information related to personal preferences or lifestyle.  The information we receive is used to provide hotel accommodations, travel arrangements and related services.  The information is stored and maintained on our secure servers in order to allow access by hotel personnel and/or future changes to the reservation by the individual or by an authorized representative on his or her behalf. 

When individuals visit our website, we utilize cookie technology to collect data that allows us to identify whether they are first time or return visitors. This information allows us to provide faster data retrieval for return visitors. The information we collect is also used to contact current and future customers regarding news and “best practices” in the hospitality industry as well as other information that only TravelCLICK can provide due to its exclusive joint partnerships and proprietary database.

We also offer a comprehensive set of analytical and marketing services to our hotels and other organizations in the travel industry.  To facilitate these services, we compile general, non-identifiable information, such as dates or length of stay, which may be aggregated and analyzed in reports and disseminated to organizations in the travel industry.  Data used for these analyses and reports is not personal information.  This information does not include names or any other identifiable indicators of individual guests or users. 

Security  
TravelCLICK is committed to protecting your personal data against loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.  We have deployed controls to provide reasonable assurance that your personal data is safeguarded from unauthorized access, copying, modification or removal in the course of its electronic transfer or storage on our secure servers.  Our employees who have a need to access the data in order to perform, develop or improve our services are bound by confidentiality obligations and their access is monitored and restricted.  We also regularly back up personal data to protect it against accidental destruction, corruption or loss. 

Onward Transfer  
In order to better facilitate the fulfillment of our users’ reservation requests and to provide accurate and useful information to hotels and travel organizations, we may utilize the services of third party partners.  We will not share your personal information with third parties without your permission unless required by law or other governmental authority.  If we do share your personal information with third parties, we require that they are held to the same standards of security and confidentiality and that they do not use information received from us for anything but the intended purpose.

Choice  
Should you sign up for our email list and then change your mind and no longer wish to receive e-mail or periodic mailings from us in the future, please let us know by sending an e-mail to [Unsubscribe@travelclick.net](mailto:Unsubscribe@travelclick.net) with your email address in the subject line. 

If you do not want your information to be used for marketing purposes or transferred to third parties, you may so indicate at the time you make a reservation or send an email to [cs@travelclick.net](mailto:cs@travelclick.net).

Data integrity  
TravelCLICK strives to keep your information accurate and to use it appropriately.  We do not process personal information for any purpose other than the purposes for which is collected or authorized without your prior consent.  Furthermore, our technology, analytics and reporting processes help us to maintain data that is relevant, accurate, complete and reliable for its intended use.

Access  
You may access, correct, amend information by sending an email to [cs@travelclick.net](mailto:cs@travelclick.net), with “privacy policy update” in the subject line.  We will also delete your personal information from our systems, upon your written request, unless we are required to retain it by law. 

Enforcement   
We verify that our data privacy and protection systems and processes comply with the Principles and this Privacy Policy through our objective self-assessment process.  As part of this process, we regularly review our people, processes and systems for compliance and efficient and effective operation. We ensure that our employees are trained to consistently and successfully implement the Principles and Privacy Policy.  Each year, one of our corporate officers submits to the Commerce Department a signed statement verifying that the self-assessment has taken place and that our systems are compliant.  

Your satisfaction is important to us.  If you have a complaint regarding the use or maintenance of your personal data by TravelCLICK, Inc., please contact us at [cs@travelclick.net](mailto:cs@travelclick.net).

We will investigate all complaints promptly and diligently to address your concerns and resolve any disputes quickly.  If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or are unsatisfied with resolution of your complaint, you may submit your complaint to the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) at <http://www.adr.org/sp.asp?id=28749>
