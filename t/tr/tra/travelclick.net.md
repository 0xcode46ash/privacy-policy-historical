This Privacy Policy applies to TravelCLICK, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, "TravelCLICK"). In our normal course of business, TravelCLICK handles personal information, including personal information collected through use of this website ([www.travelclick.com](http://www.travelclick.com/)) and other sources. We handle all personal information in our possession in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
