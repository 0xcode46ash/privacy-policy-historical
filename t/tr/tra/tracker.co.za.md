# Tracker | Privacy

## PRIVACY/ DATA PROTECTION NOTICE

Tracker Connect Pty respects your privacy and seeks to protect your personal data. The following information describes how we gather and use data.  


## What Tracker Connect Pty uses your personal information for

Tracker Connect Pty collects and uses your information to administer, support, improve and obtain feedback on our services and to detect and prevent faults and in certain instances to adhere to good corporate governance or to the law. We will also use all this information to assess what Tracker Connect Pty products and services may be of interest to individuals and to personalise our service and marketing.

## Further information/marketing

Tracker Connect Pty may contact you about those of its other services to which you do not subscribe but which may interest you. Such contact may be by post, fax, email, instant message and (in certain limited circumstances) by telephone from time to time.

## Calls to Help Desks

Calls to Tracker Connect Pty's telephone help desks may be recorded for quality control, regulatory and monitoring purposes. 

## Personal Information Tracker Connect Pty collects

Tracker Connect Pty collects and updates information about users of its services, suppliers, account and IT managers and other individuals it deals with in its day-to-day business. It may obtain this information via direct contact with you, from third parties such as your employer or another one of our suppliers and automatically via your use of our services.   


  * Information you/others give us: This information includes your contact details, registration and payment details, support problems, details around participation in events or surveys and certain relevant details of your interests and preferences. 
  * Information we collect via our services: If you are a registered user of our services Tracker Connect Pty also may gathers information about your use of our services and/or Traffic Data. Traffic Data includes logs, details of networks, data and systems accessed, details of the sender and recipients of messages sent over our services, times and location of log on or access, duration of sessions, clickstream and similar usage or system data. Traffic Data may sometimes be traceable to/related to not just companies but named individuals. 



## Storage methods and duration

Tracker Connect Pty may store your information in its databases, such as its Customer Relationship database, for reference. The information may be retained and used by Tracker Connect Pty for a reasonable period, reflecting our need to answer queries or resolve problems, provide improved and new services and any data retention requirements of the law.

This means we may retain information after an individual ceases to use Tracker Connect Pty's services or after the individual has ceased interacting with us. Except where the law, authorities or regulatory bodies require us to retain it for longer, we retain Traffic Data for a reasonable period after the Traffic Data was generated, including in some circumstances (such as with firewall logs or fault data) after any bill has been paid.

## Passing your information to third parties

Tracker Connect Pty does not sell or rent your personal data to others outside Tracker Connect Pty. In some instances, we may pass information to third parties involved in the relevant Tracker Connect Pty service (such as technology solutions providers) who wish to manage and check the distribution of their information/software and obtain payment for it. They may then match it with the data they have for this purpose. You will generally know if such a transfer of your personal data happens, except if the third parties are simply working on our behalf as our subcontractors, administrators or our professional advisers or if the data is required to be disclosed by law or to a regulator – then we might not inform you. If we sell a business division to another company and your personal data is used by that business then your data may be transferred to the buyer along with the business for them to use in the same way.

## Tracker Connect Pty Newsletters or Magazines

With some services you are given the opportunity to receive a related newsletter by email or perhaps by post. You can at any time choose to stop receiving a service’s newsletter or related magazine by following the instructions with the newsletter or Magazine.

## Interception of mail

Tracker Connect Pty may intercept some mail and email addressed to individuals in Tracker Connect Pty. The reasons it may do this are related to security of Tracker Connect Pty, its staff and others, for detection and prevention of crime and to identify correct recipients or to make sure mail is dealt with during staff absence. In the case of emails, we may reject, delay or remove content from emails which have a nature, content or attachments which may disrupt our systems or because they may pose security issues such as viruses. We may also filter out emails which contain certain content on the basis that content is offensive or the email is unwanted or spam. In certain circumstances this may unfortunately result in "innocent" emails being affected but we do try and reduce such occurrences.

## Security and staff awareness

Tracker Connect Pty has developed strict corporate policies governing information technology. These cover areas such as access control, authentication, audit, monitoring, alarms, data storage and back up and transmission standards and environment integrity. Tracker Connect Pty staff are subject to a code of conduct which requires them to adhere to privacy principles and Tracker Connect Pty has a privacy compliance programme.

## Tracker Connect Pty

Tracker Connect Pty is a private company jointly owned by VENFIN, a private investment consortium and our empowerment partners the Minworkers Investment Company who own a 25% stake.
