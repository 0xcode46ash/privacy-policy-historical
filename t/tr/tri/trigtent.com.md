# Privacy Policy | Trigtent

Privacy Policy Effective as of September 2016

Shazzu, Inc. (‘Trigtent’ or ‘we’ or ‘us’) has adopted a privacy policy (the ‘Privacy Policy’), which describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information we obtain online from and about individuals located in the United States.

Trigtent’s web site () and all other related web sites owned or controlled by us (collectively or individually the ‘Site’) are general audience web sites, and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age.

Our Privacy Policy applies to ‘Visitors,’ which means that you simply browse the Site, ‘Subscribers,’ which means that you have subscribed to receive one or more Trigtent newsletter or partner emails and ‘Members,’ which means that you have registered with Trigtent.com. The term ‘User’ refers to a Visitor, Subscriber or a Member. By using our Site, you signify your agreement with all the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Site.

From time to time Trigtent may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our personally identifiable information collection and use practices, the features of our Site or technology. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your personally identifiable information, Trigtent will post those changes in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of such Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Site after Trigtent posts a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. If Trigtent materially changes its practices regarding collection or use of your personally identifiable information, your personally identifiable information will continue to be governed by the Privacy Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the change. In the event the last e-mail address you provided to us is not valid or is not capable of delivering the notice to you, Trigtent’s dispatch of an e-mail containing the notice to that e-mail address shall nonetheless constitute effective notice.

A. COLLECTION: Collection of personally identifiable information by Trigtent.

B. NOTICE: Trigtent will provide you with notice about its personally identifiable information collection practices.

When you voluntarily provide personally identifiable information to Trigtent, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses Trigtent will make of the information.

At the time you provide your personally identifiable information, Trigtent will notify you of your options regarding our use of your personally identifiable information, including whether we will share it with outside companies (See Section C (Choice) below). This Privacy Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send you information about their products and services and therefore may want to share your personally identifiable information, provided you have given Trigtent permission to do so (See Section D (Use: Trigtent’s Use of Personally Identifiable Information) below).

Trigtent’s Site may be linked to Internet web sites operated by other companies. Some of these third party web sites may be co-branded with a Trigtent logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by Trigtent. Trigtent’s Site also carries advertisements from other companies. Trigtent is not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our Site or for the privacy practices of third party or national Internet advertising companies. Once you leave a Trigtent Site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, Trigtent’s Privacy Policy no longer applies and you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser web site to determine how they will handle any personally identifiable information they collect from you.

Trigtent’s Site may also be linked to web sites operated by companies affiliated with Trigtent(i.e., that are an entity of Trigtent, Inc.). Visitors to those affiliated web sites should refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.

C. CHOICE: Trigtent will provide you with choices about the use of your personally identifiable information.

Trigtent will not use the personally identifiable information you provide to us for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted, or share your personally identifiable information with third parties that are not affiliated with Trigtent, unless we obtain your permission.

D. USE: Trigtent’s use of personally identifiable information.

We adhere to a strict anti-spam policy.

At Trigtent we are 100% committed to protecting your privacy. We won’t reveal or sell your email address to third parties. We won’t send you emails if you don’t want to receive them, either.

When you first sign-up, we send out an email welcoming you and confirming your login name and password. Unless you choose to unsubscribe — which you can do from within that email — you will also receive an occasional Special News email from Trigtent. This is our way of notifying you about free readings, special gift offers, new reports or feature updates. You can easily unsubscribe from these at any time and still be able to receive horoscopes by email if you like.

You can rest assured that Trigtent will never share email addresses with anyone else. If you decide at any time that you want to stop receiving our member-benefits emails, you can opt-out by clicking on the Unsubscribe link at the end of every email or by visiting the “About You” area of the website.

Trigtent will use your personally identifiable information provided under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If Trigtent obtains personally identifiable information from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of that information is governed by this Privacy Policy.

Trigtent may share your personally identifiable information with companies that are affiliated with us. Provided you have given us permission, Trigtent may also share your personally identifiable information with advertisers and business partners that are not affiliated with Trigtent, but would like to send you information about their products and services. For example, Trigtent may share your personally identifiable information with the companies who supply prizes for Trigtent’s contests and may have special offers or promotions that might be of interest to Trigtent users. However, you will always have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information with third parties when personally identifiable information is collected. Moreover, we will never share your credit card information with third parties except those Trigtent uses to perform tasks (such as order fulfillment and payment processing) required to complete purchases you make through Trigtent Sites.

Trigtent employees, agents, and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your personally identifiable information. Trigtent may share your personally identifiable information with outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e., sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses) but they may only use your personally identifiable information to provide Trigtent with a specific service and not for any other purpose.

Trigtent may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess the technology that allows Trigtent to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on our Site. Your non-personally identifiable information and click stream data about your activities on our Site may be shared with these companies so this customization may be accomplished. These companies will not share your information with any third party or use it for any other purpose. Anonymous click stream and demographic information may also be shared with Trigtent’s advertisers and business partners.

There may be instances when Trigtent may disclose personally identifiable information without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of Trigtent, other entities of Trigtent, Inc. or their employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to our Site; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if Trigtent sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, Trigtent may transfer your personally identifiable information to a third party as part of that transaction.

E. SECURITY: Trigtent protects the security of personally identifiable information.

Trigtent uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard personally identifiable information in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. In addition, Trigtent uses reasonable methods to make sure that personally identifiable information is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete. However, no security system is impenetrable. Trigtent cannot warrant or guarantee the security of its servers, nor can it guarantee that information that you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to Trigtent over the Internet.

F. ACCESS: How to access, correct, or delete your personally identifiable information.

Whenever possible, Members and Subscribers may review the personally identifiable information we maintain about them in our records. We will take reasonable steps to correct any personally identifiable information a Member or Subscriber informs us of in writing is incorrect. If you are a Member, you can view, change and remove your personally identifiable information, Member preferences and Your Profile information by logging into your account and accessing your ‘Profile.’ Section A(1)(b) above describes how to change your subscriptions preferences.

If for any reason you want Trigtent to stop using your personally identifiable information, Trigtent will honor that request; however, Trigtent will retain any record of your personally identifiable information that is necessary to comply with applicable federal, state or local law. Keep in mind, moreover, that there will be residual information that will remain within Trigtent’s databases, access logs, and other records, which may or may not contain such personally identifiable information. Even after removal of personally identifiable information and User Content by you or Trigtent, personally identifiable information and User Content may still be viewable in cached and archived pages or if another User has stored your User Content.
