###  2\. Who do we share your information with and why?

When you use our website and provide information about yourself, we use this information to complete your order (i.e., to complete air, hotel, car, and other reservations), fulfil any customer service requests, and provide promotional or trip related information via email. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete your order and fulfil your travel arrangements. Such other parties may include, but are not limited to, appropriate airlines and other travel suppliers, credit card merchant services, airline reservation systems, and other global distribution systems.

These service providers will disclose information about your traveller profile to hotel, airline, cruise, rental car, and other travel suppliers whose products you have purchased. Although we attempt to select travel suppliers that are reputable companies, and we endeavour to place contractual restrictions on our third party partners who receive your personal information, to ensure that they use this in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable data protection laws, we cannot guarantee that these travel suppliers are not using or disclosing your information without your permission. Therefore, we encourage you to review the information privacy practices of any travel suppliers whose products you purchase on our website. In addition, these travel suppliers may also contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about your confirmed reservation.

Although no personal information is collected, we monitor users’ navigation of our Web site in order to better understand and serve our customers. We may provide anonymous statistical information based on this data to carefully selected third party partners and providers as necessary for business administration, customer delivery, marketing and operational, analytical, quality assurance and, though only in relation to anonymised data, marketing assistance (for example, to explore consumer trends) or other purposes as set out below. Except with your expressly given consent, we will only share your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. To the extent that any third party has access to your personal information to provide functions on our behalf, their use of this information will be limited solely to providing those functions and for no other purpose.

We may disclose your personal information to third parties, such as official bodies and our professional advisers, as far as we believe it is necessary (i) to comply with relevant laws, orders or regulations; (ii) to enforce our customer terms and conditions of use or other contractual agreements; and (iii) to protect the property and other rights of tripsta.co.uk, its group companies, customers and others (for example, in any way relating to protection against fraudulent activities in respect of tripsta.co.uk).

When you make a booking or purchase products or services offered on our website, due to our security-protection and fraud-detection processes, we may pass certain personal information which you provide to us (for example, your name, credit card, billing address details) to third party credit reference agencies, payment processors or other third parties for the specific purpose of verifying that information. If your personal information cannot be satisfactorily verified (for example, your stated billing address does not match your credit card details), we will contact you to notify you that your purchase request has not been confirmed and to request corrected details, if they can be provided, before we can process your order.

**D. Security of Your Personal Information**

We recognize the importance of security for all personal information associated with our customers and use reasonable measures consistent with industry practices to protect personal information under our control. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we will use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. In order to protect the information stored in our systems, we have implemented security measures, including data encryption technology and firewalls.

##  E. How we protect your information

We want you to feel confident about using this website to make travel arrangements, and we are committed to protecting the information we collect. While no website can guarantee security, we have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help protect the personal information you provide to us. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may only do so for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption when transmitting your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information.

##  F. Display of tailored advertising

We are committed to providing you with relevant content and information. To do this, we may, through cookies and other technologies, collect information about your travel-related searches, such as whether you are looking for airline flights or hotels. We use this information, together with other information we have collected about you, to serve you with ads, on our website or elsewhere online, that match your apparent interests. Please note that we do not combine the information we collect about your travel-related searches on this website with personal information (such as email address) to serve you with ads across other websites. We also do not share your personal information with third parties so they can serve you with advertisements.

If you wish us to stop sending you newsletters or details of other offers and promotions (opt out) please automatically subscribe through the unsubscribe link in our emails or email us at service@tripsta.co.uk.

**G. Transfer of information**

Please be aware that your information is processed outside the United Kingdom, where our servers are located and our central database is operated. Although the applicable data protection and other laws of the European Union is as comprehensive as those in the United Kingdom, please be assured that we will make every effort to ensure that your personal data is processed in accordance with the UK data privacy legislation and any other relevant legislation in force from time to time.

Furthermore, in order to process your data as described in this privacy policy, we may need to send your information internationally including to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) for example. Some of these jurisdictions offer differing levels of protection in respect of personal information and may, in certain instances, be less protective than data protection requirements of the country where we are based. We will however take steps to ensure that your personal information is transferred, stored and processed in accordance with appropriate security standards and in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and applicable data protection laws.

**H. Third-Party Links**

Our website may contain links to websites operated and maintained by third parties over whom we have no control. The information practices of those websites are not covered by this privacy policy. Any information you provide to third-party Web sites or that we provide in relation to travel reservations you made will be governed under the terms of each such Web site's privacy policy. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are entering another Web site, and we have no responsibility or liability whatsoever for the content, actions, or policies of such third-party Web sites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of all third-party Web sites that link to the Web site, because such privacy policies may be materially different from this privacy policy.
