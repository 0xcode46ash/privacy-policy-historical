# Privacy Policy - Trippeo

Effective date: August 10, 2014

### Introduction

Trippeo Technologies, Inc. and its affiliates (“Trippeo”) are committed to protecting the privacy of all individuals who:

  * visit Trippeo’s website located at trippeo.com, which includes all subdomains, present and future (the “Website”);
  * use the mobile applications that Trippeo makes available from time to time (the "Applications"); and
  * use the Trippeo services including web and mobile services.



To make this policy easier to read, we call the Website, the Applications and the Platforms together the "Services".

It is Trippeo’s policy to respect your privacy and the privacy of all users of the Services. This Privacy Policy has been established to help you understand our commitment to protecting your privacy and personal data, and the steps we take to ensure it. By visiting and/or using any of the Services, you agree to be bound by the terms of the present Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”). Where the present Privacy Policy refers to “Trippeo”, it may refer to the Services or to Trippeo Technologies, Inc., depending on the context.

Trippeo reserves the right, at any time, to modify or replace the Privacy Policy. The most recent version of the Privacy Policy is available at trippeo.com/privacy. Please check the Privacy Policy periodically for changes, though we will also notify you via email or other direct electronic communication method of any changes that, in our sole discretion, materially impact your use of the Services or the treatment of your Personal Information. Your use of the Services following the posting of any changes to the Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance of those changes.

Trippeo’s Privacy Policy forms part of its wider terms of service. If you are a visitor to the Website or if you are a Trippeo user, these terms of service are available at http://trippeo.com/terms. Both the Terms and the Privacy Policy apply to your use of the Services. Unless otherwise indicated, all defined terms in this Privacy Policy shall have the same meaning as in the Terms.

### About this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) and other non-identifiable information gathered by Trippeo when you are using or accessing the Services.

### Personal information we may collect and use 

_i) Registration and Logged-in Users_

When you first register for a Trippeo account we collect some personal information about you such as:

  * your full name and email address
  * your password, in connection with your account and your log-in facility
  * other optional information as part of your account profile 
  * information we may receive relating to communications you send us, such as queries or comments concerning our services
  * information relating to your real time location, but only where you enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information or when posting through the Supported Platforms



Trippeo uses the collected information for the following general purposes:

  * to identify you when you log in to your account
  * to enable us to provide the Services to you
  * to verify Trippeo transactions you make and for billing, security, and authentication 
  * to analyze the Website , Services and our visitors, including research into our user demographics and user behaviour in order to improve our content and Services
  * to contact you about your account and provide support
  * to share aggregate (non-identifiable) statistics about users of our Services to prospective advertisers and partners
  * to keep you informed of information about our Services we think you may find useful or which you have requested from us, provided you have indicated you would like to be contacted for these purposes



By submitting information to Trippeo when registering, you consent to the use of your information for these purposes. 

_ii) Collection of Personal Information Submitted Voluntarily_

Trippeo may gather Personal Information about organizational representatives via various methods (phone, email, online forms, in-person meetings) but only if such Personal Information is submitted voluntarily. Trippeo may use such Personal Information for sales, marketing, and support of the Services. This Personal Information is never shared with third parties. 

_iii) Credit Card or Bank Card Information_

Trippeo users have the option to connect their bank or credit cards with Trippeo for the purpose of automatically importing transactions. Trippeo does not store these passwords nor can Trippeo access user bank accounts.

### System and device information

Trippeo automatically collects and receives certain information from your computer or mobile device, including the activities you perform on our Website, the Platforms, and the Applications, the type of hardware and software you are using (for example, your operating system or browser), and information obtained from cookies (see “Cookies and Related Technologies” below). For example, each time you visit the Website or otherwise use the Services, we automatically collect your IP address, browser and device type, access times, the web page from which you came, the regions from which you navigate the web page, and the web page(s) you access (as applicable) (collectively referred to as “traffic data”). We may link this traffic data to your unique account ID to better understand your needs and the needs of users in the aggregate, diagnose problems, analyze trends, provide services, improve the features and usability of our Services, and better understand and market to our customers and website users.

Trippeo also makes use of non-identifiable information gathered for statistical purposes to keep track of the number of visits to the Services and Website pages with a view to introducing improvements and improve usability of our Services. We may share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use our Services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal experience. Your IP address and other relevant non-identifiable information may be used in order to trace any fraudulent or criminal activity or any activity in violation of the Terms. 

### Cookies and related technologies 

Trippeo uses tracking technology (“cookies”) on the Website, in the Applications, and in the Platforms, including mobile application identifiers and a unique account ID to help us recognize you across different Services. By visiting the Website or using the Services you agree to the use of cookies in your browser and HTML-based emails. Cookies are small text files placed on your device when you visit a web site, in order to track use of the site and to improve your user experience.

**Session Cookies**

The Services use “session cookies”, which improve your user experience by storing certain information from your current visit on your device, such as log-in information. These enable us to remember your log-in session so you can move easily within the Website or the Services. Without these cookies, we wouldn’t be able to provide the Services to you. These session cookies have limited functionalities and expirations, and you will be required to re-enter your Trippeo log-in information after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing your account contents and related Personal Information.

### When we may share Personal Information

Except as provided in the next paragraphs and elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, Trippeo does not divulge any Personal Information gathered via the Services to third parties.

Notwithstanding anything in the Privacy Policy to the contrary, we may share any information we have collected about you or that you have submitted:

  * when you explicitly consent to the disclosure of such information to a third party when connecting to a third-party service that asks you if you consent to such sharing;
  * where we are legally required to do so, such as in response to court orders or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or to defend against legal claims or demands;
  * if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the rights, property, or personal safety of any person;
  * if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding situations that involve abuse of the Services infrastructure or the Internet in general (such as voluminous spamming, denial of service attacks, or attempts to compromise the security of the Website infrastructure or the Services generally);
  * to a parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with Trippeo;
  * if we are acquired by or merged with another entity (in which case we will require such entity to assume our obligations under this Privacy Policy or inform you that you are covered by a new privacy policy); and
  * if this information is not private, is aggregated or is otherwise non-personal information.



Subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy, we may also disclose information to our affiliates, agents, contractors, and service providers in order to facilitate the functioning of the Services or to perform tasks that are integral to the Services, such as processing transactions, fulfilling requests for information, or providing support services or other tasks, from time to time. Information may also be transferred from Trippeo to the third parties in control of the Supported Platforms, but only to the extent required in order for the Services to function properly.

### Children

Protecting the safety of children when they use the Internet is very important to us. Our Services should only be accessed by individuals of Minimum Age. “Minimum Age” may mean different ages in different countries, depending on where the individual accesses the services. For reference, “Minimum Age” shall mean (a) 14 years old for the United States, Canada, Germany, Spain, Australia, and South Korea; and (b) 13 years old for all other countries. However, if applicable law requires that you must be older than such ages in order for Trippeo to lawfully provide the Services to you (including the collection, storage, and use of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy), then the Minimum Age would be such older age. The Services are not designed nor intended for use by children or anyone else under the age of 13.

### Security

We use industry best practices to keep any information collected and/or transmitted to the Supported Platforms or Third-Party Apps secure. This includes the use of HTTPS with TLS (Transport Layer Security), which encrypts all transmitted data, and OAuth 2.0 protocols for authentication and data transfer.

Certain Personal Information, most notably Trippeo log-in details, is encrypted during transmission using TLS. Once validated within our system, passwords are deleted from our system. In addition, Trippeo uses third-party vendors and hosting partners such as Azure to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Services. These vendors have been selected for their high standards of both physical and technological security, including ISO and SSAE16 certifications.

When payments are processed via credit card, Trippeo uses third-party vendors that are PCI-DSS Compliant. At no point does Trippeo have access to your credit card information.

You should bear in mind that submission of information over the Internet is never entirely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of information you submit via the Services whilst it is in transit over the Internet and any such submission is at your own risk, and this risk is specifically disclaimed in our Terms.

If you are a Logged-in User, it is advisable that you log out of your account at the end of every session and not leave a logged-in account unattended for any period of time, particularly if you use a shared computer or device.

### Information storage and international transfers

Trippeo aligns itself with the Safe Harbor privacy principles as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, storage, use, transfer and other processing of Personal Data transferred from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland to the United States. While Trippeo itself is not certified by the US Department of Commerce, the information that you submit via the Services is hosted on secure servers by Amazon Web Services located in the United States that are certified under the Safe Harbor Scheme for transfers of Personal Information outside the European Economic Area. Safe Harbor is an EU-recognized program that provides a way for US businesses to demonstrate that they provide adequate protection for personal information transferred to it according to EU data protection standards. Further information on Safe Harbor is available from the US Department of Commerce's website.

### Email preferences

Trippeo uses email as the primary mode of communications with our users. We want to respect your privacy by only sending emails of interest to you. Please let us know if you have communication preferences and we will do our best to make the necessary adjustments.

### Your rights

You can contact us to obtain a copy of the Personal Information held about you by us. This may be subject to a fee not exceeding any prescribed fee permitted by applicable law. You can also ask us to correct and, where relevant, erase that information. Please note that certain Personal Information may need to be retained by Trippeo for a period of time following cancellation of your account where this is necessary for our legitimate business purposes or required by applicable law. As mentioned above you have a right to change your email preferences at any time.
