PRIVACY POLICY

The Tribune-Star, referred to as "We", "Us" or "Our" as applicable, is committed to maintaining the privacy of personal information that you provide to Us when using Our web site. This Privacy Policy describes how We treat personal information received about you when you visit the Tribune-Star Web site.

 **Information Collected**

Web Site Usage Information: We automatically collect IP addresses and web site usage information from you when you visit Our web site. This information helps Us in evaluating how Our visitors use and navigate Our web site on an aggregate basis, including the number and frequency of visitors to each page of the web site, and the length of their visits.

Special Features: When you use some of the special features of Our web site and at other times, We may collect personally identifiable information from you that may include your name, age, address, e-mail address, credit-card number and facts about your interests and similar information.

Surveys and Form: We may conduct occasional online surveys or ask you to fill in forms. For example, when you are within Our web site, you may see a pop-up window offering you the optional opportunity of participating in a survey. These surveys and forms are entirely voluntary and you may easily decline to participate.

 **How We Use Information Collected**

We may use information that you provide Us in the following ways:

* For the purposes for which you specifically provided the information, for example, when you request that additional information be sent to you, We will use your personal information to process your request.
* To send you e-mail notifications about Our new or existing services, special offers, or to otherwise contact you.
* To allow Us to personalize the content and advertising that you and others see based on personal characteristics or preferences.
* To enhance existing features or develop new features, products and services.
* To provide advertisers and other third parties with aggregate information about Our user base and usage patterns.

We may disclose and use personally identifiable information in special circumstances where it is necessary to enforce Our Terms of Use (for example, when necessary to protect Our intellectual property rights) or when We, in Our sole discretion, believe it is necessary or appropriate, in

connection with a sale or transfer of some or all of Our assets in Our web site. We may also disclose personally identifiable information when We, in good faith, believe that the law requires Us to do so. As We develop Our business, We might sell or buy businesses or assets. In transactions such as these, customer information is generally one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, in the unlikely event that We or one of Our publishing lines are acquired, customer information may be one of the transferred assets.

Except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy, We will not share your personally identifiable information outside of Our organization unless you "opt in" to having your personally identifiable information shared with a company that is not affiliated with Us.

 **Your Ability to Choose**

You can always decide not to provide your personal information to Our web site, however in some cases failing to provide such information may limit your ability to use certain features available at Our web site. You can let Us know that you do not wish to receive information about special offers and new products and features by opting out at the time you give Us your personally identifiable information or after opting in by contacting Us at the following e-mail address: [max.jones@tribstar.com](mailto:max.jones@tribstar.com)

 **Cookies**

We use cookies to allow you to move quickly through Our site, to recognize repeat visitors and to allow you to take advantage of some of Our site's special features. A cookie is a string of information that is sent by a Web site and stored on your hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory.

Cookies are small files (just a few hundred bytes) and should not pose any significant disk-space concerns. When you visit Our web site, or use some of the features, We may pass cookies to your computer. Some of the cookies that We pass to your computer are long term. Otherwise, We would need to ask you for certain information with each new session, such as your login information. Some cookies do expire after a short period of time.

**Links to Third Party Web Sites**

We may make third party content or services from other web sites available to you from links located on Our web site. These other web sites are not subject to this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you review the terms of use and privacy policy at each such web site to determine how that site protects your privacy. We are not responsible for the content of those web sites or the actions of third party web site operators.

 **Security**

The personally identifiable information We collect about you is stored in limited access servers. We will maintain reasonable safeguards to protect the security of these servers and your personally identifiable information.

 **Exclusions**

Any submissions that you make to any public areas of Our web site including but not limited to, chat services, bulletin boards, reviews, letters to the editor (collectively "Public Areas") will be public and will not be subject to this Privacy Policy. We do not control, and are not responsible for, the actions of other users of Our web site with respect to any information you post in Public Areas. In addition, information that you submit to Public Areas may be collected and used by others to send you unsolicited messages and for other purposes.

 **Policy Modifications**

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically.
