**UBM MEDICA PUBLISHER AGREEMENT PRIVACY GUIDELINES AND FAQS**

**WHAT PRIVACY RESPONSIBILITIES DOES A PUBLISHER HAVE AS A MEMBER OF THE MEDICA NETWORK?**

The Agreement you signed to become a Network Member includes two simple requirements regarding web site privacy:Â  As a Member, you have agreed to:

1\. Publish your own privacy policy explaining what information you collect from people who visit your web sites(s), how you use that data and what choices people have.Â  Your policy must meet recognized best practices, for example, be available by link published in the footer or each page on your site and elsewhere as appropriate.Â  You agree to abide by your policy and update it if your practices change and to provide Medica with a working link.

2\. Separately, publish the link to the Medica Network Privacy Policy in the footer of each page on your site(s).Â  Medica will provide the link to you.

You can find these two requirements in Section B.9 of the Agreement.

The Medica Network Privacy Policy provides notice of the advertising being displayed on your site and that Medica may use registration data for its own purposes.Â  Both privacy policies, taken together, describe what information is collected – by you, by third party ad servers and advertisers, and by MedicaÂ  – from people as they visit your site(s).

**WHY ARE THERE TWO SEPARATE PRIVACY POLICIES?**

Online advertising, particularly online behavioral advertising or OBA, continues to draw scrutiny from regulators.Â  Industry has responded with self-regulatory standards about notice and consent, including detailed provisions in privacy policies.Â  The ad serving disclosures are a significant part of the Network Policy.

Publishers could indeed include both the online advertising and other network disclosures within their privacy policies.Â  The challenge, though, is that ad servers may change across the network, as Medica makes ad sales on your behalf.Â  A separate Network Policy allows updates across the Network.Â  Medica doesnâ€™t have to send you (and all network publishers) a notice and ask you to update that portion of your policy every time a change in advertising parties takes place.Â  We have more flexibility to arrange sales on your behalf.

**WHY DOES A PUBLISHER HAVE TO POST BOTH LINKS ON ITS HOME PAGE? WOULDNâ€™T IT WORK JUST TO LINK TO THE NETWORK POLICY FROM WITHIN THE PUBLISHERâ€™S POLICY?**

That is a really good question.

Medica requires a Network member to give the Network Policy equal standing to its own privacy policies because of the importance of the advertising disclosures.Â  Linking to a notice within a notice buries the information yet another level, a placement not consistent with industry standards. A FINAL NOTE

You are the only one that can assess and reflect your own data collection practices in your privacy policy.Â  For that reason, Medica cannot review your privacy policy or advise you on its accuracy or completeness.

Privacy is an important value amongst medical professionals.Â  The Medica Network is committed to high levels of transparency and privacy best practice as it serves those communities.Â  We ask Network members to share in that commitment.
