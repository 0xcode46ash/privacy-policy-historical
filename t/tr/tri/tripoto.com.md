# Privacy Policy

##### Privacy Policy (Version 1.0, Effective date: October 21, 2013)

We recognize that your privacy is very important and take it seriously. This Privacy Policy describes Tripoto's policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information when you use the Tripoto Service, via the Tripoto website and your mobile phone. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

#### Information Collection and Use

User-Provided Information: You provide us with information about yourself, such as your name and e-mail address, if you register with the Service. Your name and other information you choose to add to your profile will be available for public viewing on the Service. We may use your email address to send you Service-related notices. We may also use your contact information to send you marketing email messages. If you do not want to receive such messages, you may opt out by following the instructions in the message.

If you use your Facebook, Twitter, or other social networking site ("SNS") account information to sign in to Tripoto, we will collect and store your SNS user ID.

### __   Collecting and using your information

Tripoto uses information we collect to analyze how the Service is used, diagnose service or technical problems, maintain security, personalize content, remember information to help you efficiently access your account, monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns, and track User Content and users as necessary to comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other applicable laws.

## Account information

When you register for a Tripoto account, you are required to provide an e-mail address, your first name and a username. Unless you choose to use a third party service to authenticate your account, you will also be required to provide a password. Some of the information you provide, for example, your name and username, is listed publicly on the Tripoto Service, including on your profile page and in search results. Your e-mail address will always remain private. You may also choose to provide other select pieces of personal information in order to express yourself beyond the required information, such as a short biography, your location, your website, or a picture.

If you choose to authenticate your Tripoto account through a third party service, like Twitter or Facebook, you are linking that account to your Tripoto account. Once those accounts are linked, we may collect and store personally identifying information that you have provided to that third party service. Please be aware that the information we obtain from that third party service is often dependent on their privacy policies and/or on your settings regarding what information you have consented to share with services like Tripoto.

## Content

On Tripoto you can choose to keep your content private or public.

Private content will not be visible to anyone except you and people with whom you share the ’trip’ URL. Private content will not be cached and archived on our servers.

Public content on the other hand is accessible to everyone, including search engines. Other users can collect, reproduce, comment on, and share all publicly available Content on Tripoto.

You are free to remove or delete Content from your account at any point in time. However, there is a strong possibility that copies of public content will be retained indefinitely in our systems, including in cached and archived pages of the Tripoto Service, or if other Users have copied or saved that information. In addition, due to the nature of Internet sharing, copies of your Content, including Content that you have removed or deleted from your Tripoto account, may also exist elsewhere on the Internet and be retained indefinitely.

## Ownership of Content

The ownership of content, both private and public, is with the creator of that specific content. Tripoto does not have any ownership rights on the content in the site.

Tripoto is not liable for any of the content that is posted on the platform. While we try our best to ensure that there are no copyright violations for any of the content that is published on the platform, we cannot guarantee it since all content is crowd-sourced.

## Metadata

Metadata is usually technical data associated with Content you submit, post or share on the Tripoto Service. Users can add or may have Metadata added to their Content including geolocation, date, attribution, or other data.

## E-mail communications

We may send you notification e-mails about certain activity related to your account, for example when someone likes, comments, or collects your Content. From time to time, we may also send e-mails with news, products, offers, surveys or promotions related to Tripoto. However, we respect your inbox and if you do not want to receive e-mail from us, simply click on the ”unsubscribe” link contained within the unwanted e-mail message.

## Log data

When you use the Tripoto Service, for example when you visit our website, sign into the Tripoto Service, or interact with our email notifications, our servers will automatically record information about your interaction (”log data”). We use log data to provide, measure, customize and improve the Tripoto Service. This log data may include the date and time of your web request, your Internet Protocol (”IP”) address, your browser type and settings, the web page you were visiting before you came to Tripoto, the pages you visited, the number of clicks you made and how you interacted with links on the Tripoto Service, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and other such information about how you used the Tripoto Service. We may also use third party applications and services to collect and analyze such information.

### __   Sharing your information

## Private Information

We will never share any information which you have marked as private content unless we have your permission from you. We will never rent or sell your personal information to third parties outside Tripoto without your consent.

## Information you share with the public

Any information you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Tripoto Service, including your profile page information, is accessible to anyone. When you submit, post or share Public Content on the Tripoto Service, it may be re-shared by others.

## Information you share with third party services

We enable you to share Content that you have submitted, posted or shared to the Tripoto Service with other third party services. For instance, you may share your posts on Twitter and Facebook. You may also access third party websites and services through links that have been embedded by other Users within their Content on the Tripoto Service.

## Business transfers

As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Content and any other information such as customer, email, and visitor information collected through the Tripoto Service, may be among the items sold or transferred as part of that transaction. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution. The acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your personal information as described in this policy.

### __   Keeping your information secure

We take the protection of your private information very seriously and your Tripoto account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You are responsible for preventing unauthorized access to your account and personal information, and for controlling access to any e-mails we send you. You should choose and maintain a strong unique password for your Tripoto account and remember to logout once you have finished using the Tripoto Service on a shared computer. Please be aware that we cannot ensure the security of any information or guarantee that information on the Tripoto Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.

### __   Your choices about your information

You may correct, amend, add or delete personal information from your Tripoto account at any time by logging in and visiting your profile page. As noted above, you may unsubscribe from unwanted Tripoto e-mail communications by clicking on the ”unsubscribe” link contained within such communications. However, until your account is deleted you will continue to receive all system e-mails.

### __   Other websites and services

Content on Tripoto may include links to third party websites or services that are not owned and controlled by Tripoto. We are not responsible for the practices employed by any websites or services linked to or from the Tripoto Service, including the information or content contained within them. This policy does not apply to those third party websites or services.
