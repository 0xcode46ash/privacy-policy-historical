# TripIt | Online travel itinerary and trip planner

The following Privacy Policy summarizes the various ways that we use the information you provide to us or we gather from you while you use the tripit.com online service (the "Service"), as provided by TripIt, Inc. ("TripIt" or "us" or "we"), at www.tripit.com (the "Site"). It is our goal to provide you with information that is tailored to your individual needs and, at the same time, protect your privacy. 

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Your use of any part of the Service will constitute your agreement to this Privacy Policy. If you cannot agree with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Service. This Privacy Policy does not cover information collected elsewhere, including, without limitation, offline or on sites linked to through the Service. 

In addition to reviewing this Privacy Policy, please read our [User Agreement](https://web.archive.org/uhp/userAgreement). Your use of the Service constitutes agreement to the User Agreement as well. 

This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time; the date of the most recent revisions will appear on this page, so check back often. In the event that we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will place a prominent notice on the Site informing our users of such changes. Continued use of the Service by you will constitute your acceptance of any changes or revisions to the Privacy Policy. 

* ### What Information We Collect from You

When you register with TripIt, we ask for the basics including your name, email address and password and allow you to provide us with other information including your travel information, history and preferences. 

For all Site visitors, not just registered users, we collect information such as IP address, browser type, domain name, access times, duration of visit, referring URL, platform, new and repeat information, time stamp and exit page information. 

If you contact us, we also will collect the information you provide that details the nature of your question or problem to enhance the quality of our Service. 

* ### What Organization Is Collecting the Information

TripIt, Inc., a Delaware corporation, operates and manages [www.tripit.com](https://web.archive.org/). More information about us may be found at [About Us](https://web.archive.org/uhp/aboutUs). 

* ### How Your Information Is Protected

We maintain data handling and storage practices and procedures that are designed to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of user information. Current Internet security methods and technologies are used to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure correct use of information. 

* ### When We May Share Your Information

The information we gather is used to create and maintain your travel itineraries and your travel profile and, if you have elected to receive them, send you marketing messages. We also use the information that we gather to target content on our Site to more closely match your interests and, if you have selected to receive email communication from us, target email marketing messages that are more appropriate to your needs. 

When you use the Service, the personal information you provide will be shared with the third parties you designate for access to such information including other web sites, your friends, relatives and business associates. Depending upon the type of access you grant to such third parties, they may also be permitted to edit the information you have provided to us and to designate others to access and edit such information. 

Certain portions of the information you provide to us also may be displayed in your public profile. As an essential element of the services we offer, most of the personal information you explicitly provide to us when you register or update your profile is displayed on your public profile. Once displayed on publicly-viewable web pages, that information can be collected and used by others. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so it is very important that you do not put personally identifiable or other private information in your posts. Once you have posted information publicly, while you will still be able to edit and delete it on the Site, you will not be able to edit or delete such information cached, collected and stored elsewhere by others (e.g., search engines). 

In general, most of your travel related information, such as upcoming destinations and travel statistics, is displayed only to other TripIt members to whom you have specifically connected as part of your TripIt network. You can change your privacy settings to designate which types of information are shared and with whom by visiting the [Profile and Privacy](https://www.tripit.com/account/edit/section/your_profile) page. 

In addition, we may share your personal information as follows: 

  * When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of TripIt, our users or others; and in connection with the enforcement of our User Agreement.
  * In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.
  * With business firms contracted to provide specific services to us, in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. In situations such as this where your data is shared with a third-party firm, the firm will be contractually obligated to use your personal data only for the purpose for which our relationship with the firm exists. The firm will not have the right to share your data with other organizations or contact you outside the bounds of their contract with us.
  * If we have a good faith belief that we are required to do so by law or legal process, to respond to claims, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of TripIt or others. This includes, but is not limited to, fraud, technical malfunctions or abuse of our network or systems. We also may provide user information to third parties for the purpose of resolving disputes that arise in the normal course of business.



From time to time, we also may share general information about our Site and visitors such as the number of visitors, aggregate and non-personally identifiable demographic and travel data, etc., with our advertisers and partners. 

Other than as set out above, you will be notified when personal information about you will be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to have us share such information.
