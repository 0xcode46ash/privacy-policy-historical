If we decide to change our privacy policy in regards to how we utilize any personally identifiable information, we will post those changes on our homepage. 

We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy or if we change our email practices, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.

When you register with TripIt, we ask for your email address and password and once registered allow you to provide us with your name, home location and up to three other email addresses in order to access your account as well as other information including your travel information, history and preferences. TripIt then uses this information to build personalized travel itineraries. 

If you wish to upgrade your account with us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and billing address, mobile phone number) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). 

We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. 

If you also select to have TripIt track your travel rewards points, TripIt will store account details for each of your travel rewards points accounts including each account’s login username and password. 

For all Site visitors, not just registered users, we collect information such as IP address, browser type, domain name, access times, duration of visit, referring URL, platform, new and repeat information, time stamp and exit page information.

When you request that TripIt send an invitation email to your imported contacts, TripIt stores this contact information for the sole purpose of sending this invitation email.

JobScore shares this information back with TripIt for the sole purpose of determining your eligibility for the position in which you are applying. 

## 3\. How Your Information Is Protected

We maintain data handling and storage practices and procedures that are designed to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the personally identifiable information and email addresses submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Current Internet security methods and technologies are used to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure correct use of information. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information such as credit card number on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). 

## 4\. When We May Share Your Information

The information we gather is used to create and maintain your travel itineraries and your travel profile and, if you have elected to receive them, send you marketing messages on behalf of TripIt and our travel partners. We also use the information that we gather to target content on our Site to more closely match your interests and, if you have selected to receive email communication from us, target email marketing messages that are more appropriate to your needs. 

When you use the Service, the personal information you provide will be shared with the third parties you designate for access to such information including other web sites, your friends, relatives and business associates. Depending upon the type of access you grant to such third parties, they may also be permitted to edit the information you have provided to us and to designate others to access and edit such information. You may change your settings at any time as to who has access to your information by going to your account settings and then changing your publishing options. 

Certain portions of the information you provide to us also may be displayed in your public profile. As an essential element of the services we offer, most of the personal information you explicitly provide to us when you register or update your profile is displayed on your public profile. In order for your profile to be made public you must go to your profile settings and then profile visibility. By default your profile is not for public viewing. Once displayed on publicly viewable web pages, that information can be collected and used by others. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so it is very important that you do not put personally identifiable or other private information in your posts. Once you have posted information publicly, while you will still be able to edit and delete it on the Site, you will not be able to edit or delete such information cached, collected and stored elsewhere by others (e.g., search engines). 

In general, most of your travel related information, such as upcoming destinations and travel statistics, is displayed only to other TripIt members to whom you have specifically connected as part of your TripIt network. You can change your privacy settings to designate which types of information are shared and with whom by visiting the [Profile and Privacy](https://www.tripit.com/account/edit/section/your_profile) page.

  * In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.
  * With business firms contracted to provide specific services to us, such as a credit card processing company, email messaging providers, and SMS providers, in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. In situations such as this where your data is shared with a third-party firm, the firm will be contractually obligated to use your personal data only for the purpose for which our relationship with the firm exists. The firm will not have the right to share your data with other organizations or contact you outside the bounds of their contract with us.
  * As required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site...To respond to claims, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of TripIt or others.

From time to time, we also may share general information about our Site and visitors such as the number of visitors, aggregate and non-personally identifiable demographic and travel data, etc., with our advertisers and partners. 

Other than as set out above, you will also have the choice to authorize third party websites and mobile applications to access your travel information as part of their service to you. The reason for allowing this authorization is to make it easier for you to access your travel information on a mobile device and to more easily incorporate your travel information with your personal and professional calendars.
