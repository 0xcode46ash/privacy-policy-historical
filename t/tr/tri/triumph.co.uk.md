### Other websites

Our website and online services may contain links to other websites. This privacy policy applies only to official Triumph online services and events. When you visit other websites please make sure you read their privacy policy.

 **Please Note** : This privacy policy does not cover the Triumph Motorcycles Repair and Maintenance Information (RMI) site, it has its own privacy policy.

### Cookies and other tracking technology

 **Cookies**

Cookies are small files which are stored on a user’s computer. They are designed to hold a modest amount of data specific to a particular client and website, and can be accessed either by the web server or the client computer. This allows the server to deliver a page tailored to a particular user, or the page itself can contain some script which is aware of the data in the cookie and so is able to carry information from one visit to the website (or related site) to the next.

Triumph will not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information about you. However, if you wish to restrict or block the cookies which are set by Triumph websites you can do this through your browser settings. The ‘Help’ function within your browser should tell you how.

Alternatively, you may wish to visit [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/) which contains comprehensive information on how to do this on a wide variety of browsers. You will also find details on how to delete cookies from your machine as well as more general information about cookies.

Restricting cookies may impact on the functionality of our online services.

Please note that each online service that uses cookies should have its own cookie notice. Cookie lists:

  * [Triumph Motorcycles websites](http://www.triumphmotorcycles.co.uk/global-content/website-cookies-used)
  * [For The Ride Blog](http://fortheride.com/privacy-cookie-policy/)



**Pixel Tags**

We may use pixel tags as part of our online services. Pixel Tags (also called clear GIFs, web beacons, or pixels) are small blocks of code on a webpage that can collect information such as:

  * the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the device that accessed the page containing the tag
  * the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the pixel tag appears
  * the time the page containing the pixel tag was viewed
  * the type of browser that fetched the pixel tag, and
  * the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server.



**E-mail tracking**

When corresponding with you via HTML capable e-mail, we may use 'format sensing' technology, which allows pixel tags to let us know whether you received and opened our e-mail.

We may use unique hyperlinks in e-mails we send to you; this is to see if e-mails have been opened and responded to.

 **Do not Track (browser setting)**

Our online services do not currently recognise ‘do not track’ signals.

 **Changes to our privacy policy**

We may review this privacy policy. Any changes will be included in an updated policy and published to this page.
