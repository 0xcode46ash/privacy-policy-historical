# Trickster Cards Privacy Policy

## What does this policy apply to?

This privacy policy of Trickster Cards, Incorporated (“Trickster Cards”) covers how we collect and use information acquired as part of your use of the Trickster Cards apps and websites (collectively “services”) created by us which link to this policy.

_By installing or using services linking to this policy, you consent to the terms and practices outlined herein._

## What information is collected?

We collect general information including crash statistics, error logs, types of hardware and browsers used, locale, IP address, and timestamp of server requests.

We collect play information including a player name, history of played games, gameplay statistics, and in-game friends.

We also collect personal information such as email addresses and third party account IDs if provided.

Visits to our web site outside our games are tracked by Google Analytics.

## How is the collected information used?

We use collected information to help improve our services. For example, crash statistics and error logs are used to help identify and fix problems with services. Similarly, hardware, browser, locale, and timestamp information is used to improve testing of new features and fixes. IP addresses are used to help identify where different games are popular.

Play information such as the history of played games and in-game friends are used to report statistics to users and facilitate re-connecting them with others they’ve played with before.

Lastly, personal information such as email addresses and third party account IDs are used to enable users to share their play information across multiple games and devices.

Users who submit feedback also have the option of sharing their email address for the purpose of a reply.

## Cookies

In our game and apps, we use a cookie to remember your player ID and settings.

We use a cookie outside the United States and Canada to remember if you dismiss the “We use cookies…” banner.

On web site pages outside our games, a cookie is used by Google Analytics to remember you between visits.

Finally, cookies are used by our advertising provider (Google) when an ad is displayed before a game (see “What about ads?” below).

## What about third parties?

We DO NOT sell or share collected information with third parties.

However, third parties can collect their own information when used to access services provided by us. Please refer to the privacy policies of relevant third parties (for example, your app store) to understand what data they collect and how it is used.

Other users are shown only your player name. In-game friends may also see if you are currently playing. Neither see your contact information.

## What about ads?

When you view ads using our services, our advertising provider uses cookies to serve ads based on prior visits. Google’s use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads based on visits to our services and/or other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting [Google’s Ads Settings](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/).

## Will this policy change?

This policy may be updated by us periodically. You are encouraged to check this policy regularly to ensure you are aware of the latest terms. Continued use of services provided by us constitutes an acceptance of these changes.
