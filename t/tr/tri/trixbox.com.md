# Privacy Policy | Fonality trixbox | The Open Platform for Business Telephony

### Privacy Policy

#### General

Fonality takes your privacy and the confidentiality of your business data very seriously. We understand that your phone system is critical to your business, and that you need to trust that system and the company that provides it fully.

This policy outlines the types of information Fonality may collect, and our commitment to keeping that information safe, secure and private.

#### trixbox CE: Collection and Use of Customer Information

The trixbox CE platform contains monitoring tools that provide anonymous system configuration information to Fonality on a regular basis. The information collected includes the number and types of phones connected, the number and type of PCI interface cards, and information about your hardware configuration such as CPU, RAM, motherboard, and network card types.

No information is collected, sent or stored regarding usage of the system. No information about calls made from or to your trixbox CE system is collected or sent, individually or in aggregate. No information about call menus, phone numbers or any other usage information is collected, sent or stored.

The system configuration information collected is stored by Fonality, in aggregate, and is used to assess global trixbox CE usage patterns, and to prioritize our development of interoperability for different devices. In some cases, this aggregated information may be shared with the manufacturers of those devices.

**You can disable the collection of the system configuration data at any time via your trixbox CE dashboard.** Once disabled, no data about your system is collected, sent or stored by Fonality.

#### trixbox Pro: Collection and Use of Customer Information

trixbox Pro provides a service where our customers upload and store their system configuration information and call statistics data on Fonality servers and equipment. Customers using have the ability to disable the collection of call statistics data, which will cause all call data to be stored locally on the customer’s PBXtra. Disabling this data collection will disable any available trixbox Pro graphical reporting capabilities.

In addition, trixbox Pro software gives customers, at their discretion, the ability to record and save voicemails, phones calls and chats. All communications content is stored locally on the customer’s server(s), and unless provided for under a separate service contract, Fonality does not store any voicemail, call recordings, chats or other communications.

Fonality does not review, edit, disseminate, or use individual customer information, data or communications in any way, except to investigate a technical support request initiated by a customer, to investigate a suspected Terms of Use violation or as may be required by law. We may use aggregated, non-identifiable usage statistics to assess system performance and scale.

#### No Monitoring of Customer Communications

All phone calls are routed locally on the customer’s individual trixbox Pro system, and externally via the customer’s selected communications service providers. Fonality does not provide voice services, and customer phone calls or other voice communications do not access or otherwise pass through the Fonality network. Fonality does not monitor the content of any phone calls.

#### Maintenance of Optional Secure Connection to trixbox Pro

In order to monitor the performance of your system, provide you with technical support and provide product enhancements and upgrades, Fonality by default maintains a secure electronic connection to your trixbox Pro server(s). Fonality implements numerous security techniques to ensure the safety of customer data and system access and to minimize the risk of network intrusion.

Customers can, at their discretion, elect to disconnect this connection. Disconnecting the connection will prevent the administration of your trixbox Pro server(s), and will disable other important features, including graphical reporting.  
In addition, we will not be able to provide technical support or software updates until the connection is re-established.

#### Billing Information

When Fonality bills for services rendered, a third-party processing company is used to charge customer credit cards and collect payment. This third-party is used only to process credit card charges, and does not store or distribute customer credit card or billing information.

#### Fonality Web Properties

Fonality may collect information from visitors to the Fonality.com, trixbox.com and trixbox.org web sites, or any other web sites operated by Fonality. We may collect the Internet addresses of Fonality site visitors.

We may also analyze non-identifying statistics that we collect from website visitor usage, and provide this data to qualified third parties.

#### Electronic and Physical Mailing Addresses

Removal from this list will significantly limit our ability to provide you with technical support.

trixbox CE has an optional registration module that allows you to provide personal information about yourself and the system, including electronic and physical mailing addresses and telephone numbers. If you choose to provide this information via the registration module, your information will be sent to Fonality, and stored on Fonality’s servers. 

Fonality may use the registration information provided by you to periodically communicate with you regarding new products, product updates, and important Fonality news and information.

You have the option to exclude yourself from these communications. If you would like to cease receiving communications from Fonality, please send a request [www.trixbox.com/support](http://www.trixbox.com/support) with the subject line “UNSUBSCRIBE”.
