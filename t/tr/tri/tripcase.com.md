# Privacy - TripCase

Last modified: August 6, 2014

TripCase (the “Service”) is a trip-related information and messaging service, available from Sabre GLBL Inc. (the “Company”), either online through our website at [www.tripcase.com](http://www.tripcase.com/) or via our mobile application.  TripCase provides users with the ability to integrate all of their trip-related information into one location, share information regarding their trips, and receive valuable informational updates and deals related to their trips.

## Introduction

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it.  Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices. You agree to our privacy practices as set out in this privacy statement.

This statement describes the information that the Service collects and how that information may be used by us.  This statement does not apply to information we collect through any means other than the Service, actions that you may take as a user to share your information or to information collected on any other Company or third-party site that may link to or be accessible from the Service.  We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties through which you share your information or which are accessible from the Service.

Our servers and data centers for the Service are located in the U.S.  We may also subcontract processing to or share your PII with third parties located in countries other than your home country.  If you are accessing the Service from outside the U.S., you agree that your PII may be transferred to the U.S. or another country, which may have different privacy and data security protections than those of your own jurisdiction, to be processed and stored.  You expressly consent to your PII being used as set out in this paragraph.

## Safe Harbor

TripCase adheres to the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Frameworks with respect to PII about EU travelers that we receive via the Service in the United States, and has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program please visit<http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

Neither this Privacy Statement, nor our participation in the Safe Harbor program, applies to any travel supplier, such as an airline, car rental company or hotel, nor do they apply to any individual traveler’s employer or travel agency (for purposes hereof, a “travel arranger”) that obtains any related services from TripCase. We recommend that you review the privacy policies of your travel agency and of relevant travel suppliers. In addition, our participation in Safe Harbor does not apply to travelers in non-EU and non-Swiss jurisdictions.

## Collection of Personally Identifiable Information

Personally identifiable information (“PII”) is any information used or intended to be used to identify a particular individual, which includes name, address, telephone number, email address, financial account number, and government-issued identifier.  Non-personally identifiable information (“Non-PII”) is data that is not PII, but that is reasonably linkable to a particular computer or device.  Non-PII includes, but is not limited to, unique identifiers associated with users’ devices and IP addresses, where such identifiers or IP address are not linked to PII.  We collect several types of information from and about users of the Service, including:

  * PII you provide to us when you register for the Service or thereafter, such as your name and email address;
  * Information you provide outside this application to other companies (such as a travel agency, airline or other travel provider, hotel, loyalty programs, etc.) that you associate with your TripCase account;


  * Information included in any messaging you undertake through the Service, such as sharing of trip-related information;
  * If you contact us, personal information you provide to us that details the nature of your question or problem.



## Use of PII

We use PII in the following ways:

  * To present the Service and its contents in a suitable and effective manner for you and for your computer or mobile device;
  * To provide you with information, products or services that you request or otherwise elect to receive from us or from one of our strategic partners;
  * To notify you about changes to the Service;
  * To allow you to utilize the trip integration, sharing, and messaging features of the Service, if and when you choose to do so; and
  * To provide you with e-mail or other messaging regarding additional products or services you may be interested in, either from us or from one of our strategic partners, including promotional e-mails or messages.



## Disclosure of PII to Third Parties

We may from time-to-time make certain PII available to strategic partners that work with the Company such as the following:

  * Various subsidiaries of the Company that support the Service ;
  * Third party service providers supporting our business who provide services such as information processing, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys;
  * Third party service providers we partner with to provide you offers of additional products or services based upon your trip-related information;
  * Your employer or travel agency with regard to those trips or portions of trips designated as business travel by you and as such, shared with your employer or travel agency via TripCase;
  * In the event of merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of the Company’s assets, in which case PII held by the Company about its customers will be among the assets transferred to the buyer.



User Sharing via TripCase

TripCase allows you, as a user, to take actions to share information regarding your trip with other TripCase users, your mobile phone contacts, or via various social networking sites (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram).  The sharing process enables you to share a particular item of content, on an individual basis, to these third party services or other TripCase users by using the share functionality in the Service. Please note that sharing of such content on a third party service may be posted as activity on the Service, regardless of your account settings. To share an individual item of content to a third party service, you’ll be prompted to enter your access credentials for that third party service. TripCase may store your name, e-mail address, and an access token or similar credentials obtained from the third party service, so that you are able to share particular items of content, on that third party service, on an individual basis, without entering your access credentials again.

When you choose to allow others to follow your trips by allowing access to your contacts via your mobile phone, those chosen will be notified of your trip via e-mail and given the chance to set up their own TripCase account, if they do not already have one of their own.   Once they have set up their account, your trip will show up in that user’s Following section on TripCase.   Anyone who is following your trips will be able to see any changes to your itinerary, if your flight is delayed, etc.   If you choose to always share with any other TripCase users, they will be notified of every trip and its details until you remove them from that feature.

If you connect to the Service using credentials of a third party Social Networking Site (“SNS”) such as Facebook or Twitter, you authorize us to collect your authentication information, such as your name, e-mail address, and encrypted access credentials. We may store this information so that it can be used for the purposes explained in this statement, and it may also be used to verify your credentials with the SNS. The information available to TripCase from an SNS is affected by the privacy settings you establish at the SNS.  You understand and agree that an SNS’s use of information they collect from you is governed by their privacy policies, and TripCase’s use of such information is governed by this privacy statement.

If you connect to any third party site other than an SNS using the credentials of your TripCase account for data sharing with that third party, you authorize the collection of your authentication information, such as your name, e-mail address, and encrypted access credentials, as well as any other PII that third party site may choose to access.   You do so at your own risk and understand and agree that the third party’s collection of such information is governed by their privacy policies, and TripCase’s use of such information is governed by this privacy statement.

We may also disclose your PII to third parties to:

  * Comply with any court order or other legal obligation;
  * Enforce or apply our terms of use and any other agreements;
  * Protect the rights, property, or safety of the Company, our customers, or others. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction; or
  * if you expressly opt in to such sharing.



## Collection and Use of Non-PII

We also collect non-PII.  We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-PII for any purposes.  Non-PII that we collect may include information regarding your activities on our website or our application, which may be aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of the Service are of most interest.

Location-Based Services

To provide location-based services to mobile application users of the Service, the Company or our partners may collect and use precise location data, such as the real-time geographic location of your device.  This location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by the Company and our partners to provide location-based products and services.  We treat this location data as non-PII.

TripCase also utilizes your location information in order to allow you to add information regarding your trip (e.g. a particular venue) to your TripCase itinerary for future reference by you for viewing by those TripCase users that are following that particular trip, including your employer and travel agency should you designate your trip as business-related.   This service is provided in conjunction with data provided by Foursquare but your location and data are not shared with Foursquare in order to provide this service.

## [Cookies and Other Technologies for Use of the Services](http://travel.tripcase.com/cookies)

The TripCase website, mobile application, email messages, and advertisements may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons.  which are small pieces of code placed on a page to monitor the behavior and collect data about the viewing of that page.  Other versions of these technologies may also collect information regarding your Internet protocol address and type of browser, the type of operating system you are using, the domain name of your Internet service provider, the web pages you have visited, location information, and the type of mobile device and provider used to utilize the Service, as well as the advertisements and tools you may have accessed via TripCase.  Access to the information available through these technologies will also be provided to our third party providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies and partners through these technologies. These technologies help us to improve and to deliver a better and more personalized service by enabling us to:

  * Estimate our audience size and usage patterns;
  * Store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize the Service according to your individual interests;
  * Speed up your searches; and
  * Recognize you when you return to the Service’s online website.



You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the appropriate settings on your browser.  Check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies.  For further details about how we utilize cookies and how to deactivate cookies, please see our [Cookies Policy] on our website.  Please note that certain features of the Service will not be available once cookies are disabled.

## Online Behavioral Advertising

We, our third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, and partners may also use cookies, pixels, web beacons and other technologies to collect various types of Non-PII for purpose of online behavioral advertising. A representative list of the types of non-personally identifiable information collected may include the following not in combination with PII: trip start and end dates, airline departure and return dates, booking date, origin and destination, class of airline service, hotel check-in and check-out dates, hotel name, hotel city, hotel country, car rental company and dates, and similar information.  This information will be not be identified to a specific person and will be used for online behavioral advertising.  If you wish to learn more about online behavioral advertising, we recommend that you review the [Network Advertising Initiative’s web site](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/?partnerId=1//),

If you wish to prevent a third-party advertiser or advertising network from collecting your information while using the Services, you may either visit each ad network’s website individually and opt out at that location, or you may visit the National Advertising Initiative (NAI) opt-out site to opt-out of all network advertising cookies.   Click [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/?partnerId=1//) for the NAI gateway opt-out site:  [Consumer Opt-out | NAI: Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).  This site will also allow you to review the third party advertising companies’ privacy statements.

## Accessing Your PII

You may access, correct or delete your contact information and preferences through your TripCase account.  For other PII, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access so you can request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if the Company is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes.  We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.

## Data Security

We have implemented reasonable measures designed to secure your PII from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure.

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Any content, including PII, that you contribute to be shared, published or displayed on the Service, or transmitted to other users of the Service, either via the Service or via social networking or other third party sites available through the Service, is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them.  We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Service.  You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of your content, including PII, that you contribute to be shared, published or displayed on the Service, or transmitted to other users of the Service, may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by other users. Although we take efforts to protect your PII, we cannot guarantee the security of your PII transmitted to the Service. Any transmission of PII is at your own risk.

## Children Under the Age of 13

The Service is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect PII from children under age 13. In the event that we learn that we have collected PII from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to delete that PII as soon as possible.

## Changes to Our Privacy Statement

It is our policy to post any changes we make to our privacy practices on this page. The date the privacy statement was last revised is identified at the top of the privacy statement.

If any European traveler experiences an issue regarding PII that the European traveler cannot resolve directly with their travel arranger or TripCase, TripCase agrees to use the International Centre for Dispute Resolution/American Arbitration Association Safe Harbor Program, as its independent recourse mechanism. All disputes shall be finally settled under the International Dispute Resolution Procedures of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution, Safe Harbor Program by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Procedures. The location of any in-person hearing will be Dallas, Texas, but TripCase also consents to any hearing being conducted by telephone or video conference.
