# Privacy Policy

We at Cartics.com (referred to as "Trini Autos For Sale," "we," "us," or "our") recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of certain information ("Information") collected about our customers and prospective customers (referred to as "Customers," "you" or "your"). This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it. At Cartics it is our intention to give you an understanding about how we collect your Information and the use we make of it in the course of our business.

To that end, Cartics gathers two types of information about Customers: data that Customers provide through optional, voluntary registration on our sites; and data Cartics gathers through aggregated tracking, mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. Such information enables us to tailor our content to fit Customers’ needs better and to help our service providers understand our Customers. We do not share Personal Information with advertisers. Because Cartics derives its revenue partially from e-commerce, providing such aggregated data is essential to keeping our service _**OPEN**_ **** to the public. However, be assured that Cartics will not disclose personal Information to third parties without your consent, except as may be noted in this Privacy Policy or disclosed to you when the Information is submitted.

**How does Cartics collect Information?**

_Registration_

We collect information by specifically requesting it from you. Generally this occurs when you register at a site or request information or a service. Usually, the Cartics sites and Cartics’ service partners use your information to operate the sites and to deliver services you request.

_Usage tracking_

_Use of Internet Protocol ("IP") Addresses:_

An IP address is a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you’re surfing the Internet so that your computer can be identified by the main computers, known as "Web servers," that "serve up" Web pages.

Cartics collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, and to audit the use of our site. When Customers request pages from Cartics and/or its affiliates’ sites, our servers log the Customers’ IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a Customer’s session will be logged, but the Customer will remain anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a Customer when we feel it is necessary to protect our service, site, customers or others.

_Use Of Cookies_

What are cookies? Cookies are small pieces of information that a Web site sends to your computer for record-keeping purposes, which information is stored in a file on your computer. Cookies make Web surfing easier for you by saving your preferences so that we can use the saved information to facilitate your use of our Web site when you return to the site. Cookies do not tell us your individual identity unless you have chosen to provide it to us. We never save passwords or credit card information in cookies. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and as such, you’ll find that most major Web sites use them.

By showing how and when Customers use a site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the information from cookies to provide services better tailored to our Customers’ needs.

Most cookies expire after a defined period of time, or you can delete your cookie file at any time. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of Cartics’s services will not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized preferences, and/or may have difficulty completing marketing transactions.

Cartics and/or its affiliates have two primary uses for its cookies. First, we use them to specify a Customer’s preferences. For example, Customers can specify keywords across several categories or markets so you don’t have to tell us repeatedly about certain features in the vehicle you are seeking. Second, we use cookies to track Customers’ Web site usage trends and patterns. This helps us understand our Customers’ needs better and improve areas of Cartics’ services that our Customers find valuable. While both of these activities depend on the use of cookies, you have the option of disabling the cookies via your browser preferences.

**With whom does Cartics share Information?**

As a general rule Cartics will not disclose any specific personal information that you submit to us about you ("Personal Information") in a manner that connects you with the Personal Information, except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. The following describes some of the ways that your Personal Information may be disclosed.

1\. Vehicle Dealers: Personal Information is disclosed to vehicle dealers for the purpose of assisting you in a vehicle purchase transaction.

2\. Third Party & Aggregate Data: From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from third parties exists. If you opt to receive information from these third parties, Cartics will (with your permission) share your name and e-mail address with such third parties. Under confidentiality agreements, Cartics may match Personal Information with third party data. Also, Cartics may keep track of what portions of the Web site Customers are visiting and other Customer statistics, and aggregate this information to help us create a better experience for users of our Web site. This is all done without knowing your name or other Personal Information in order to describe our viewers and services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.

3\. Other: Cartics may also disclose account Information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this Information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating Cartics’ rights, or may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with any of Cartics’ rights or property, other Cartics Customers, or anyone else. Cartics may disclose or access account Information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.

For example, if you "click" on a Cartics.com search result, the "click" may transfer you off the Cartics.com site. These other sites may include sites of advertisers, sponsors and partners unrelated to Cartics. These other sites may send their own cookies to Customers, collect data, or solicit Information.

Cartics and its affiliates do not control such sites, and, therefore, are not responsible for their contents or the hyperlinks or advertising they choose to place on such sites.

**Is my Information secure from others using the Cartics site?**

The importance of security of all information associated with our Customers is an important concern to us. We exercise care in providing secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, Cartics and its affiliates can’t ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, Cartics uses industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.
