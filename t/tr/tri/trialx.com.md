# TrialX - Enabling Patients to Find New Treatments through Clinical Trials Recruitment

At Applied Informatics we take privacy of your information very seriously. Below is our privacy policy. 

**Privacy Statement**  


  
Trialx.org is an online service provided by Applied Informatics, Inc. (hereby referred to as APP), a Delaware company . Trialx.org is based on the technology termed as the Columbus Clinical Trial Participants Matching Platform (henceforth referred as Columbus). This technology platform and services is offered by APP on www.trialx.org (hereby referred to as Trialx.org)  


**Information Collection and Use**

  
APP's  policy on the Trialx.org site is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. APP does not share personally identifiable information about its users with any other site, advertisers, or partners. APP does not sell, trade or rent to others your personally identifiable information collected on the Trialx.org site. The Trialx.org site and the databases are hosted on the Google App Engine service (GAE).  We take all the necessary steps to keep your data safe and secure, however your data is also subject to GAE privacy policy as described here http://code.google.com/appengine/privacy.html. 

**Third-party Online Personal Health Records  
**

Trialx.org allows users to import their health information from Third-party Online Personal Health Record (TOPHR) services such as Microsoft HealthVault (www.healthvault.com) and Google Health (www.google.com/health). Trialx.org may be listed in the application directory provided by a TOPHR, in which case you can link Trialx.org application to your health profile at the TOPHR site. Once you add the application, Trialx.org pulls relevant information from your TOPHR in a secure manner and uses that information to match you to highly tailored clinical trials. By using Trialx.org with a TOPHR, you are giving APP permission to request a temporary copy of your personal health information from TOPHR for the purposes of matching you to clinical trials. This data request is only made for a short period (as and when you use our service) when you request to be matched to a trial and is NOT stored by Trialx.org. If you decide to register an account with Trialx.org linked with a TOPHR, then during your search session, Trialx.org may request you to provide additional information, which will be used to further refine your clinical trial matches and will be stored securely by Trialx.org. This information is used to tailor the clinical trials to an individual and to send any updates for new clinical trials as they become available. 

  
**Registration**

You can access our service in two ways. One, through linking Trialx.org with a TOPHR as described above. Secondly, you can use our trial matching service directly through the Trialx.org site. It is optional for a user to complete a registration form. If a user chooses to complete one, a user may then chose to give certain information (such as name, email address, some health information). This information is used to tailor the trials to an individual and to send any updates for new trials as they become available. Your data is stored in a highly secure and reliable manner and will not be used for any purpose other than providing you a personalized clinical trial matching service. 

**Log Files**

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement, and gather broad information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Sharing**

We will only share aggregate statistical information about clinical research trends (such as kinds of trials searched for by people). This aggregate information does not contain personally identifiable information and therefore cannot identify any specific individual. 

**Links**

This Web site contains links to other sites such as the www.ClinicalTrials.gov. Please be aware that APP is not responsible for the privacy practices of such sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. 

**Security**

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. We secure all data exchanges and Internet communications with a secure server, using secure sockets layer (SSL) with 2048 bit encryption and digital certificates. All APP employees and agents with access to databases have signed confidentiality agreements, which forbids any use of the data beyond supporting APP’s working needs. Critical account access information (passwords, secret questions/answers) are encrypted in the database so they will be indecipherable to those who are able to access the database. We will never ask you for your password or secret question/answer, and you should inform us if anyone has attempted to obtain this information from you. 

**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post changes on our home page so our users are always aware of the information we collect, the ways we use it, and any circumstances under which we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
