# TRIP.comTravel - Privacy Policy

**The TRIP.com Commitment to You**

At TRIP.com, we take your privacy concerns very seriously. From the very beginning (way back in 1996), we have been - and will remain - committed to protecting your personal information at all times.

We appreciate that you, as a valued customer, provide us with your personal data, which helps us improve your travel experience and customize our services to reflect your individual needs. We use your personal profile information to tailor our services to your unique preferences and requirements. By sharing this information with us, you allow us to personalize and improve our site, while making your travel-planning process a more convenient, reliable, and seamless experience.

TRIP.com is proud to be a charter member of the [ Better Business Bureau Online](http://www.bbbonline.com/) and the [ Interactive Travel Services Association](http://www.interactivetravel.org/) (ITSA). These alliances help to ensure that you receive the highest level of privacy and protection available on the Internet today.

Except for the purposes indicated in this Privacy Policy, we will NOT disclose, sell, share, or rent any of your personal information, including your name, address, credit card number, or transaction history, to any third party. **

What Personal Information Does TRIP.com Collect?

**

We are committed to protecting your personal information - whether you are a TRIP.com member or a guest interested in researching and booking travel anonymously. Like you, we enjoy the convenience of shopping online, but recognize that privacy is an important issue. At TRIP.com, we appreciate your trust in us and remain committed to ensuring that your personal information is secure.

We collect a variety of personal information - data such as your name, address, credit card information, etc., which allows TRIP.com and its partners to recognize you and complete your transactions - from our TRIP.com customers. Some information is necessary to successfully complete a transaction; other, non-essential information is voluntary, and used to enhance your online travel-planning experience. Below you'll find a list of the personal information we collect from you, and a brief description of how that information is used at TRIP.com: 

  * **Transaction Information**

At TRIP.com, as with any other online travel site, it is necessary for us to obtain transaction information from you in order to complete your purchase. This includes your name, contact information (used for purchase-related communications only), travel selections, and credit card data. This information is stored with each transaction and shared with appropriate vendors (for example, airlines) and third parties facilitating the transaction (for example, credit card authorization companies). We will provide only the information necessary to ensure your travel arrangements are confirmed and executed with these providers. 

  * **Member Profile Information**

When you sign up to become a member with TRIP.com, we will ask you to provide us with basic profile information (your name, email address, and password information). You can also provide us with optional information such as credit card numbers, frequent flyer account data, and travel preferences. Visit [ my profile](https://web.archive.org/web/20011217182833id_/http%3A//www.trip.com/trs/trip/profile/planning_center.xsl?%257B$addTrackingParams%257D) for more details.

We will use your member profile information to tailor your travel experience to your unique preferences and requirements. For example, the information you provide us will allow us to remember that you frequently fly between two specific cities and prefer non-smoking hotel rooms. You may choose to store as little or as much personal data as you'd like. However, by providing us with profile information about your travel needs and preferences, you help us customize your travel-planning process - allowing for a more convenient, speedy, and tailor-made experience.

If you don't want to store your personal information, you can still research and book travel on TRIP.com anonymously. Keep in mind, however, that certain TRIP.com features (for example, saved itineraries, stored travel research, and personal homepages) are only available to our members.

  * **Automatic Planning and Buying Information**

Certain travel information is automatically collected during the research and/or purchase stages of your travel-planning process, such as destinations, arrival and departure dates, and preferred vendors. If you do not want to store this information, you can research and purchase travel as a guest (remember, however, that guests do not have the ability to save itineraries or access upcoming trips on our site).

  * **Usage Tracking Information**

TRIP.com servers collect software client information, such as IP addresses, browser versions, operating systems, and pages accessed during TRIP.com sessions. This information is used in an aggregated form (e.g. number of pages accessed) to view site usage patterns, and is not tied with any of the other personal data you have provided to TRIP.com.

  * **Advertising**

We and/or our partners may use some of your personal information for the purpose of serving ads. Basic information about your visit to our site, such as the number of times you have viewed an ad, may be used to serve ads; however, personally identifiable information, such as your name, will not be provided to advertisers. In the course of serving ads on this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. 

  * **Promotional Emails, Newsletters, and Communications**

Whether you are a member or a guest who has transacted with TRIP.com, we may contact you concerning your transactions. (An example of this would be if your flight has been cancelled, delayed or re-routed.) We may communicate with you via email, phone, fax, or street address, and will ask you to tell us the best time(s) to contact you.

As a TRIP.com member, you may also receive additional communications from us concerning issues we feel are important to share with our valued customers (for example, announcements about major site changes or adjustments to this policy). You have the opportunity of opting out of these communications by choosing to research and purchase travel as a guest (remember, however, that guests do not have the ability to save itineraries or access upcoming trips on our site).

In addition, you can sign up for:

    * TRIP.com's weekly travel newsletter, packed with the latest travel news, special air and hotel deals, and information on exciting vacation packages 
    * Promotional emails containing special TRIP.com deals and/or its partners
  
In addition to protecting your privacy, we are committed to ensuring that you do not receive information from TRIP.com that you have not specifically indicated your willingness to receive. This means we will not call you, or send emails, marketing materials, magazines, or any other offers that you do not request. Remember, you can ALWAYS unsubscribe to the travel newsletter and emails, and can opt out of receiving TRIP.com communications by modifying your profile. Simply tell us you're not interested and you won't receive these messages from us again.  

 **How Does the Use of Personal Information Differ for TRIP.com Non-members and Members?**

 **Non-Members**

If you are a non-member, we will only store your transaction information. This information will only be used to complete your travel purchase, and will not be used for any other purposes. It may be shared only with appropriate vendors (e.g. airlines) and third parties facilitating the transaction (e.g. credit card authorization companies). The communication you receive from TRIP.com will only be related to your purchase. **

Members

**

When you become a TRIP.com member, you gain access to a wide range of customizable tools, including viewTRIP travel packets, saved itineraries, and your own personalized homepage. We use the information you have provided us (in your member profile, travel research and booking, etc.) in the following ways:

  * To facilitate your transaction.
  * To help you in your travel-planning process by recalling stored information that you will need when making a purchase. (For example, we will remember that you prefer to sit in the aisle when you fly and require a ski rack on your rental car.) By allowing us to save this information, you will not need to remind us each time you come back to book your trip with us. 
  * To tailor content to reflect your personal travel preferences and requirements. For example, we can provide you with weather forecasts, city maps, driving directions, and other destination information that will help make your travel enjoyable and stress-free.
  * To provide you with promotional emails containing special deals from TRIP.com and/or our travel partners for the places in which you travel. 

**Sharing of Personal Information**

At TRIP.com, we understand that, as an online consumer, you care about how your personal information is shared. We take your privacy concerns very seriously and are committed to ensuring that your personal information is secure at all times. We will only share your personally identifiable information in the following ways: 

  * When you book travel with TRIP.com, the personal information you provide us will be shared with the appropriate third parties necessary to complete your purchases. This includes the vendors you have selected (e.g. airlines, hotels, etc.) as well as the third parties facilitating the transactions (e.g. credit card authorization companies). The personal information we provide these third parties will ONLY be that which is necessary to ensure your travel arrangements are successfully confirmed and executed. 
  * When you sign up for TRIP.com wireless services, we will share your personal information with our parent company, Galileo International, for the purpose of identifying your travel reservations only.
  * We may periodically hire reputable, carefully screened third parties to perform services on behalf of TRIP.com. (An example of this would be for sweepstakes promotions.) The companies and/or individuals we hire will only have access to information required to complete their function - and may ONLY use it on behalf of TRIP.com. They are strictly prohibited from using your personal information for any other, non-TRIP.com-related purposes. In addition, they may not keep or use the data after their work for TRIP.com has been completed. 
  * When required by law, we may disclose certain personal information (e.g. court order or subpoena).
  * When you sign up for flightTRACKER Pro, your personal information is subject to periodic disclosure to the FAA due to current FAA requirements.
  * If you violate our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20011217182833id_/http%3A//www.trip.com/trs/trip/content/terms_conditions/terms_conditions.xsl?%257B$addTrackingParams%257D), of which this Privacy Policy is a part, or any law, rule, or regulation, we may be required to disclose your personal information in order to apply or enforce TRIP.com remedies (e.g. in case of customer fraud).
  * In the event that TRIP.com or certain of its assets are acquired, customer information may be one of the transferred assets.

In addition to ensuring your privacy at all times, we are committed to ensuring that you do not receive information - from TRIP.com or from any of the third parties with which we share your information - that you have not specifically indicated your willingness to receive. (Remember: we get spammed, too, and know how frustrating it can be.)

Our Partners

**   
Some services on our site may be offered in partnership with reputable, carefully screened TRIP.com vendors. Because these vendors may a have slightly different privacy policy, please be sure to review our partners' privacy policy before providing any personal information. **

Personal Information Security

**   
We are dedicated to providing a safe and secure online shopping environment. We use state-of-the-art, industry-standard, secure socket layer (SSL) technology, which is utilized by most popular browsers, including Netscape and Microsoft Explorer. This technology encrypts (or converts into code) your information (name, address, credit card number, etc.) before it is transferred across the Internet from your computer to our secure server. This ensures that all your personal information is protected at all times.

Your personal travel profile is password-protected. For added security, we will not display or email your password - so it's important to keep it in a safe place. If you ever forget your password, we will help you create a new one.

Your credit card information is stored in our database in an encrypted form to further safeguard your most sensitive information.

We will permit only authorized employees, who are trained in the proper handling of personal data, to access your information.

To further protect the information you share with us, we have an exhaustive security system, which includes: world-class firewall technologies; logical network segmentation, allowing restricted access to stored profile information; and logical and physical security restrictions to our databases and systems. At TRIP.com, we're COMMITTED to ensuring your privacy at all times - and we (well, OK, our tech guys) have designed a way to guarantee it.

 **Use of Cookies**   
At TRIP.com, like at many web sites, we use "cookie" technology. The cookie is a small text file that resides on your hard drive. From time to time, we will request the cookie from your browser so that we can retrieve your stored information.

The cookie prevents you from having to make the same selections over and over again. In addition, the cookie helps you navigate our site more efficiently, and enables us to better tailor our content and services to most effectively suit your needs. With the cookie technology, we are able to recognize you, provide you with your own personalized homepage, and allow you to save information and access it any time you visit our site.

At TRIP.com, we never use cookies to store personal information (such as credit card numbers), nor can the information we store in the cookie ever be read by any web site other than ours.

Please note that with most browsers, you can set the preferences to show a warning each time a cookie request is received. You can also set the browser not to accept cookies at all. However, because we won't be able to personalize your TRIP.com experience if we can't recognize you, we suggest that you allow your browser to accept cookies. If you choose to set your browser to not accept cookies, you will not be able to automatically access your personalized homepage; instead, you will need to log in from the TRIP.com homepage each time you visit the site.

 **Children**   
TRIP.com does not knowingly sell products to anyone under the age of 18. **

Notification of Changes

**   
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post all changes on the TRIP.com homepage. We want to ensure that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will notify you via email if, at any point, we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected. At that time, you will have the opportunity to remove your profile information from our database if you choose. **
