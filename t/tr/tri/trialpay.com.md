# Privacy Policy - TrialPay

## TrialPay Privacy Policy

Last modified: July 15, 2016

Note: If you are a resident of Canada, please also see Canadian-specific privacy policy terms further below.

We at TrialPay, Inc. and the subsidiaries we own or control (collectively, "TrialPay") respect your privacy. We are publishing this version of the TrialPay Privacy Policy (the "Policy") to clearly disclose our practices and approach to data privacy and data protection.

This Policy describes how we collect, use, transfer, and safeguard information about you and your options regarding accessing or modifying such information. You accept and agree to this Policy when you visit a website on which this Policy is posted, create a TrialPay account, or interact with TrialPay's online and off-line services (collectively, our "Services").

Throughout this Policy we use the terms "personal information" and "PII" to describe information that can be associated with a specific natural person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information or PII to include information that has been anonymized or aggregated so that it does not identify a specific natural person. If you give us PII on behalf of someone else (or someone else gives us PII on your behalf), the person providing the PII must have consent to do so from the person whose information is being provided to TrialPay.

TrialPay complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce (collectively, the "Safe Harbor Principles") regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. TrialPay has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view TrialPay's certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

We sometimes obtain personal information from other sources, such as through mergers and acquisitions with other companies as well as through commercial arrangements with data brokers, business partners, and other sources. For example, a third party may provide us with your age, gender, or zip code. Information we receive from a third party is subject to your agreement with such third party. We may merge information we receive from third parties with information we have collected or will collect.

Some elements of TrialPay's Services such as events, websites, and offers may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. For example, TrialPay may sponsor a website through which you can simultaneously purchase products and services from multiple TrialPay partners. If you provide information in these cases, both TrialPay and each company involved in the transaction may receive the information collected in connection with that transaction and thereafter may use the information according to each company's privacy policy and any other agreement each company may have with you.

If you participate in payment card-linked offers, we may collect your email address, payment card details, address, and information regarding your payment card purchases such as the date and time of your purchase, your returns of items purchased, the category of your purchase, and location of the store where you made a purchase.

## How We Use Information We Collect

## Safe Harbor Principles

**Notice and Choice**

TrialPay provides notice about the choices and means we offer you for limiting use and disclosure of your PII. Notice is provided in this Policy, in our web pages, and in other locations where we collect PII.

You can choose whether or not to provide your PII to us. If you choose not to provide PII, you can continue to interact with TrialPay, but you may be not be able to take advantage of certain offers, options, events and services that depend upon TrialPay having access to accurate PII. You can update your marketing communications preferences by logging into your TrialPay Online Account at [www.trialpay.com/login/](https://www.trialpay.com/login/), following the unsubscribe instructions you have received from TrialPay, or [contacting TrialPay's customer support team](https://www.trialpay.com/support/contactus/).

Please note that while TrialPay offers you some control over what marketing communication you will receive, certain transactional, relationship, and legally required communications will not be affected by the choices you have made about marketing communications.

**Onward Transfer**

We will only share your PII with third parties if we determine in our good faith judgment that those third parties provide an adequate level of data protection to help ensure the security of your personal data, such as by agreeing to abide by industry codes of conduct, the Safe Harbor Principles, or the terms of a contractual confidentiality commitment.

**Security**

We take reasonable precautions including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the PII we have collected from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. In addition, we use standard security protocols and mechanisms to transmit sensitive data such as passwords and payment information.

These safeguards are designed to protect against, but are not a guarantee against, the loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction of your information.

**Access and Accuracy**

We aim to maintain the accuracy of your contact information and personal data. If you need to update or correct this please do so by logging into your TrialPay account.

Before we provide access to any personal data or make any changes to it we may ask you to verify your identity or provide other details to help us respond to your request.
