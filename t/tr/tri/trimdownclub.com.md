**Third Party Financial Institutions and Affiliates**  
When you purchase Products available on our Website, you must submit payment information directly to Clickbank, including your credit card or debit card number, as well as your zip code. Such information may be recorded and filed by Clickbank to fulfill your orders. In addition, when you return previously purchased Products or request a refund or exchange, you may be asked to give your name, address, and other Personal Information.

Our Web Site may collect additional information and may install cookies on the hard drives of our Registered Users and others who visit our Website. The use of cookies will allow us to improve our Website based on the user’s preferences and is a widely used industry practice of online businesses.

We are committed to employing reasonable technology in order to protect the security of our Website and our offline files. However, even with the best technology, no site is 100% secure. We will take reasonable measures which we believe are appropriate to protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction, and, where possible, will ask that any third parties to whom we may transfer such Personal Information take comparable steps to protect that security.

**INFORMATION COLLECTED ON OUR WEBSITE OR THROUGH YOUR SUBSCRIPTION TO OUR PROGRAM OR THROUGH YOUR PURCHASE OF OUR PRODUCTS**

**Personal Information.**  
We may request Personal Information from you when you become a Registered User on our Website, subscribe to our Program or purchase our Products. In all of these cases, we will collect Personal Information from you only if you voluntarily submit such Personal Information to us. Unless you give us permission to do so, we will not sell, share, license, trade or rent your Personal Information other than as specified in this Privacy Policy. You do not have to provide us with any Personal Information to visit our Website. However, if you choose to withhold requested information, you may not be able to visit all sections of our Website or have access to all of our Products or other features of our Website, such as our online tools or submitting Postings to any Community Area on our Website.

**Non-Personal Information.**  
When you become a Registered User of our Website, subscribe to our Program or purchase one of our Products, we also may collect information that by itself cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information (such as age, profession or gender) and health information (such as current weight) (“Non-Personal Information”). Non-Personal Information may also include user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our Website. Non-Personal Information is used to help us understand who uses our Website and to improve and market our Website in general and our Program and Products in particular.

**Information from Other Sources.**  
We may also supplement the information we collect with information from other sources to assist us in evaluating and improving our Website, our Program and our Products, to determine your preferences so that we can tailor our Website, our Program and our Products to your needs, and/or to study nutritional, weight-loss, behavioral and fitness questions in general.

We may use your Personal Information, and/or transfer your Personal Information for any legal purpose including, without limitation: (1) to deliver the Program and/or the Products to you that you have requested; (2) to validate your compliance with the [Terms & Conditions](http://www.trimdownclub.com/terms-condition); (3) for content improvement and feedback purposes; (4) to reach you, when necessary, regarding your use of our Website, our Program or our Products; and (5) to bring retail opportunities and promotional offers to you by email, direct mail, telemarketing, and/or online banner advertising.

We will not disclose Personal Information collected from Registered Users of our Website to third parties, except to companies with which we are actively affiliated, to contractors we use to support our business (such as technical support, delivery services, and financial institutions, such as ClickBank) whereby we will require such third parties to treat such Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and in connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the business of our Website to which the information relates. We may hire third parties to review certain Personal Information to advise us on demographic and marketing related issues, but only after such third parties have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of any Personal Information contained in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

When your information is provided to third parties, these third parties may include providers of direct marketing services and applications. We or these third parties may supplement the information we collect online with outside records to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our Website, our Program and our Products to you, and/or to offer you targeted advertising and other opportunities to purchase products and services that we believe may be of interest to you.

We will NEVER share your credit card information with third parties unless you have given us explicit permission to do so, such as in order to fulfill a third party offer that you have accepted from us. By permitting us to collect this information, you will be able to receive free information on products and services that may be of interest to you. You also enable us to personalize your experience with us so that we can provide you with the highest quality of service. By submitting your email address on our Website, you agree to receive email from us and our third party advertisers. We, and our third party advertisers, may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. You may cancel your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking the opt out link or other unsubscribe option that is included in the email. We only send emails to people who have voluntarily provided us with such contact information, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails.

In addition, you agree that by submitting your email address or phone number on our Website and/or registering as a Registered User and/or subscribing to our Program and/or to purchase our Products, such act constitutes a purchase, an inquiry, and/or an application for the purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (ATSR), 16 CFR §310 et seq. and any applicable state and local “do not call” regulations. We and our third party advertisers retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the ATSR and the applicable state regulations.

We feature public forums such as those contained in a Community Area where you and other Registered Users of our Website can communicate with one another. In addition, we offer the “Public Profile” and “Account Settings” features of our Website to permit you to share information about yourself (including, if you elect, Personal Information) with others. **THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES NOT PROTECT YOU WHEN YOU USE OUR PUBLIC FORUMS OR PROVIDE INFORMATION (INCLUDING PERSONAL INFORMATION) ABOUT YOURSELF THROUGH THE PUBLIC PROFILE FEATURE OR THROUGH ANY COMMUNITY AREA AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE.** You should be aware that any Personal Information shared in a Community Area or through our Public Profile feature is public information and may be seen or collected by third parties that do not adhere to our Privacy Policy, although the availability of personal pages or groups identified as “private” may be limited to certain permitted Registered Users. However, even information marked “private” may be viewed by our staff. You should think carefully before disclosing any Personal Information in any public forum, or through the Public Profile feature, on our Website. For example, you should not select a username that includes Personal Information.

**Third Party Actions**  
We do not control and are not liable for the actions of our third party marketers or advertisers. We pride ourselves in working with quality companies, but have no control over the actions of those third parties.

**Other Uses of Personal Information**  
We also use Personal Information, including information provided to us from our service providers, to continually assess and improve the Products we offer. To serve you better, we may combine the Personal Information that you give us with publicly available information and information we receive from or cross-reference with our marketing partners and others. We use that combined information to enhance and personalize your experience with us, to communicate with you about our Products that may be of interest to you, and for other promotional purposes.

**Promotional Information and Marketing Materials**  
We would like to inform you of Products, sales and special offers that might benefit you. You will have the opportunity to sign up for e-mails about our Products, sales and special offers. If you would like to stop receiving such promotional information from us please click the link at the bottom of the email correspondence, which allows you to opt out of receiving further correspondence.

**Disclosures of Personal Information in Legal Proceedings**  
If we, our service providers or our Affiliate(s) are requested by law enforcement officials or judicial authorities to provide Personal Information, we or the applicable third party provider, may, without your consent, provide such Personal Information. In matters involving claims of personal or public safety, we, or the applicable third party provider, may provide your Personal Information to appropriate authorities without your consent or court process. We, or the applicable third party provider, also will provide your Personal Information in response to a search warrant or other legally valid inquiry or order, or to an investigative body in the case of a breach of an agreement or contravention of law, or in litigation involving us, the applicable third party provider, or otherwise as required by law. We may also disclose Personal Information to assist in debt collection where you owe a debt to us.

**Access to Personal Information by Companies that Work with or on Behalf of Us**  
Some of our operations, such as our electronic commerce, may be managed by service providers who are unaffiliated companies. These companies may share Personal Information with their affiliates and with service providers whom they engage to perform services related to our Website or the operation of our business. Examples of these services include payment processing and authorization, fraud protection and credit risk reduction, product customization, order fulfillment and shipping, marketing and promotional material distribution, website evaluation, data analysis and, where applicable, data cleansing. These companies may have access to your Personal Information on a confidential basis only to the extent necessary to perform their functions. In no event will we authorize these companies to use your Personal Information for any reason other than for us to be able to provide you with those specific services.
