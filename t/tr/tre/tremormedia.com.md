##### Opt out of Interest-Based Advertising

Tremor Media uses advertising cookies to improve the online experience of its users by trying to match the ads we serve to the possible preferences and interests of users and by limiting the number of times an ad is shown. By so doing, ads that Tremor Media serves may be more relevant and useful to you. You may always opt out of the cookies that Tremor Media uses to serve online interest-based advertising by clicking on the button above. After you opt out, these cookies will no longer be associated with your browser. You will continue to see relevant ads, but these ads will be served based on information available in the Internet environment, such as the content of a web page. Also, you may see the same ad repeatedly because Tremor Media will not be able to limit the number of times it is served to you. If you have opted-out of the cookies that Tremor Media uses and subsequently delete the “opt out” cookie from your browser, change your browser, or buy a new computer and wish to opt out of Tremor Media interest-based advertising again, you may always do so by clicking on the button above.

**For the Tremor Media Network Services**

WHAT DOES TREMOR MEDIA DO?  
Tremor Media is an online advertising company that offers advertisers opportunities to display their interactive or video ads on top-tier websites. Our services streamline the selection and delivery of interactive and video ads for advertisers and web publishers.

HOW DOES TREMOR MEDIA DELIVER ADS?  
Ads delivered by Tremor Media appear in primarily two contexts on a website as follows:  
(i) in an ad banner or other ad unit on a web page (“rich media ads”) and (ii) as part of a video stream (“in-stream ads”) through a player or widget.

Rich media ads: Our advertisers’ rich media ads typically feature interactive features, including video.

In-stream ads: An in-stream ad, similar to a television commercial, appears at the beginning, middle or end of a video stream on a website.

Most of our advertisers’ rich media and in-stream ads are delivered by Tremor Media proprietary or AdTech technology. AdTech is a third party technology service provider who is our agent for delivering our advertisers’ advertisements.

HOW ARE ADS SELECTED FOR DELIVERY?  
Tremor Media’s customers are advertisers that ask us to display their ads on websites affiliated with Tremor Media (“Tremor Media Network”). The web publishers that comprise the Tremor Media Network and other websites are subject to their own privacy policies and not the privacy policy of Tremor Media. Advertisers specify where, when and in what context they want their ads to be displayed. These specifications are sometimes called targeting parameters.

Tremor Media uses its proprietary or AdTech ad serving technology to select, target and deliver ads according to the advertisers’ specifications. In order to select an ad, the ad serving technology will receive information provided by the web publisher, user’s browser, and advertiser which, in turn, is automatically recorded by the servers of Tremor Media and/or AdTech. This information is usually non-personally identifiable, although some web publishers or advertisers may also incidentally provide personally-identifiable information about a user. Tremor Media does not actively collect, and does not use or store personally- identifiable information about a user.

The Tremor Media proprietary and/or AdTech ad serving technology may use cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies* in order to select, target, and measure the effectiveness of advertisements, including to determine what ads to present so that they may best relate to the preferences of users on the Tremor Media Network and other websites.

Tremor Media uses Adobe Systems Incorporated Flash cookies only for the limited purposes of (i) ad policy management functionality – to control the frequency, timing, and source of advertisements – of Acudeo®, the Tremor Media video monetization platform used by publishers participating in the Tremor Media Network and (ii) enhancing the functionality of our advertisers’ ad units.

Tremor Media and its advertisers may also use ad service providers to help present advertisements on the Tremor Media Network and other websites. These ad service providers use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on your computer to select, target, deliver, and measure the effectiveness of advertisements to determine or predict the characteristics and preferences of users. Tremor Media may use data that ad service providers collect to help present interest-based advertisements. This data is non-personally identifiable information and is used to make advertisements more relevant.

Tremor Media may share non-personally identifiable information about users with certain ad service providers so that they can help Tremor Media target more relevant advertisements. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by other ad service providers is subject to their privacy policies, not the privacy policy of Tremor Media. You can find out more about ad service providers and the choices you have about these technologies by clicking on the links at the bottom of is Privacy Policy.

IS INFORMATION TRANSFERRED TO TREMOR MEDIA SUCCESSORS AND AFFILIATES?  
Tremor Media may transfer the information it collects in connection with its business to any successor – in – interest to Tremor Media (such as a company that acquires Tremor Media), or internally to one or more affiliates (such as a corporate subsidiary or parent). Tremor Media may also disclose information if it determines that an applicable law, regulation, or legal process requires it, or if Tremor Media determines that it needs to share such information to protect or enforce Tremor Media’s rights or the rights of another user.
