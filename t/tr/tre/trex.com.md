###### Use of Personal Information

We use the information you give us to perform the services you request. For example, if you fill out a form requesting more information about Trex, we will use the information you provide us to contact you about Trex products. We may also use information you provide us or information we collect to help us improve your experience on our website, or to process a warranty claim.

###### Your Consent

We collect information to provide you with services, deliver products to you, and to keep you informed about our products.

For example, if you provide your information to us, we may use it in the following ways:

  * To provide you special offers, news, updates, and promotions;

We will only collect and process personal data about you where we have lawful bases.
