> INFORMATION COLLECTED

> We collect non-personally identifiable information about you in a number of ways, including tracking your activities through your IP (Internet Protocol) address, computer settings, most-recently visited URL, or through cookies (described below). We may also ask you to provide certain non-personally identifiable information about yourself, such as your age, your occupation, buying preferences, interest in Trex, etc. We do not collect personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily submit such information to the Trex Web site by, for example, filling out a survey or registration form, or requesting literature.

> USE OF INFORMATION
> 
> Trex may use the information to tell you about Trex® products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. Personally identifiable information may be used to contact you again either by online electronic communication (such as e-mail), or by regular mail or telephone. Trex users may opt-out of receiving future mailings from Trex by unsubscribing from Trex emails or other contacts by emailing [ webmaster@trex.com](mailto:webmaster@trex.com?subject=Attention:%20Privacy%20Policy). Trex has the right to monitor the Trex Web site electronically, from time to time, and to disclose any information necessary to satisfy any law, regulation, or other government request, to operate the Trex Web site properly, or to protect itself. Non-personal demographic and profile data is used to tailor your experience at the Trex Web site, showing you content we think you might be interested in. This information may also be shared with Trex’s dealers, distributors or contractors on an aggregate, non-personal basis. When Trex shares such information with dealers, distributors or contractors, it is not traceable to any particular user and will not be used to contact you again.

> USE OF IP ADDRESSES
> 
> We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the quality of the Trex Web site. We do not use IP addresses to personally identify users. We do not track the usage patterns of individual users, but rather how well each page on our site performs overall.
> 
> USE OF COOKIES
> 
> When you view the Trex Web site we may store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a "cookie" or similar file. Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on the Trex Web site. Cookies do not spy on you or otherwise invade your privacy, and they cannot invade your hard drive and steal information. Rather, they help you navigate a web site as easily as possible. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. Cookies can allow the Trex Web site to remember you when you return so you do not have to enter your registration data at each connection.

> SECURITY

> The Trex Web site contains links to other web sites. Trex is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites, and does not warrant the accuracy or completeness of any other web site that the user may access through the Trex Web site or which provides links to the Trex Web site.
