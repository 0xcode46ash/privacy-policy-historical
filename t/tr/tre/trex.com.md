# Company Information > Privacy Policy | Trex

Trex Company, Inc. ("Trex") is committed to protecting the privacy of Trex users’ personal information. This privacy policy applies with respect to the information that Trex collects from its Trex website ("Website"), located at [www.trex.com](http://www.trex.com/), and all web pages accessible through the Website. Amendments to this privacy policy will be posted at this URL and will be effective when posted. Your continued use of this site following the posting of any amendment, modification or change shall constitute your acceptance of the terms thereof.

INFORMATION COLLECTED

We collect non-personally identifiable information about you in a number of ways, including tracking your activities through your IP (Internet Protocol) address, computer settings, most-recently visited URL, or through cookies (described below). We may also ask you to provide certain non-personally identifiable information about yourself, such as your age, your occupation, buying preferences, interest in Trex, etc. We do not collect personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily submit such information to the Trex Website by, for example, filling out a survey or registration form, requesting literature or creating an account to design a deck. The types of information that may be requested include your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.

USE OF INFORMATION

Trex may use the information to tell you about Trex® products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. Personally identifiable information may be used to contact you again either by online electronic communication (such as e-mail), or by regular mail or telephone. Trex users may opt-out of receiving future mailings from Trex by unsubscribing from Trex emails or other contacts by emailing [question@trex.com](mailto:question@trex.com?subject=Attention:%20Privacy%20Policy). Trex has the right to monitor the Trex Website electronically, from time to time, and to disclose any information necessary to satisfy any law, regulation, or other government request, to operate the Trex Website properly, or to protect itself. Non-personal demographic and profile data is used to tailor your experience at the Trex Website, showing you content we think you might be interested in. This information may also be shared with Trex’s dealers, distributors or contractors on an aggregate, non-personal basis. When Trex shares such information with dealers, distributors or contractors, it is not traceable to any particular user and will not be used to contact you again.

USE OF IP ADDRESSES

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the quality of the Trex Website. We do not use IP addresses to personally identify users. We do not track the usage patterns of individual users, but rather how well each page on our site performs overall.

USE OF COOKIES

When you view the Trex Website we may store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a "cookie" or similar file. Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on the Trex Website. Cookies do not spy on you or otherwise invade your privacy, and they cannot invade your hard drive and steal information. Rather, they help you navigate a website as easily as possible. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. Cookies can allow the Trex Website to remember you when you return so you do not have to enter your registration data at each connection.

SECURITY

The Trex Website uses industry standard security measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. While there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet, Trex will take reasonable steps to protect the safety of your personal information.

If you have created an account with us, we urge you to keep your password in a safe place and not to divulge it to anyone. Also, remember to sign off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit. This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place such as a library or Internet café.

OTHER WEBSITES AND LINKS

The Trex Website contains links to other websites. Trex is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites, and does not warrant the accuracy or completeness of any other website that the user may access through the Trex Website or which provides links to the Trex Website. Trex authorized dealers, distributors or contractors are independently owned and operated, and are neither affiliated with nor agents or representatives of Trex. Trex makes no representations or warranties as to, and accepts no duty or responsibility for, the performance, acts or omissions of such parties.

CORRECTION AND UPDATE OF INFORMATION

Trex allows its users the option to change or modify information previously provided. This may be done through e-mailing the changed or modified information to [question@trex.com](mailto:question@trex.com?subject=Attention:%20Privacy%20Policy). Trex will use reasonable efforts to ensure that your information is removed from or corrected in our records.

CHILDREN'S PRIVACY (UNDER THE AGE OF 13)

Trex takes children's privacy seriously and wants children and parents to understand that the Website is not intended for children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not use this Website. We do not permit anyone under the age of 13 to open an account with us. We do not seek to collect personal information about children through our Website. If we become aware that a person submitting personal information to us through any part of our Website is a child under the age of 13, we delete the information as soon as we discover it and do not use it for any purpose, nor do we disclose it to third parties. Since we do not seek to collect any personal information about children, and we delete information collected inadvertently as soon as we discover that a child has submitted it, we typically retain no information about children that could be reviewed or deleted. If a parent requests review or deletion of information about their child before we have discovered and deleted the information, we will of course honor that request. Please contact us at [question@trex.com](mailto:question@trex.com?subject=Attention:%20Privacy%20Policy)
