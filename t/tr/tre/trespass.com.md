### How We Collect Information

### Cookies

The Trespass website uses cookies. A cookie is a small text file which is stored on your computer’s hard drive when you visit a website. It allows the website to recognise you as a user and remember the information you have given.

We use two types of cookies on our site; session cookies and persistent cookies. Neither of these save information that identifies you personally.

Both types are used to track movement of customers from page to page allowing for site statistics to be collated.

A session cookie only lasts as long as your visit to the site. These are used to aid functionality of pages including the shopping basket by remembering the various items you have added and allows you to continue shopping and return to it at a later time. Once your ‘session’ has ended these cookies are deleted.

A persistent cookie will remain on your hard drive until it is deleted. These are used to remember your details when you revisit the website. For example: your login username or items in your basket from a previous visit. If you choose to stay logged in, this cookie expires after 30 days and is removed, if you do not choose to stay logged in everything is removed at the end of the session.

To analyse site statistics and traffic we use Google Analytics. Again persistent cookies are used by this tool, but do not store any information identifying you personally. The information is collected purely for statistical and analytical purposes, evaluating each visitor’s use of the website. The cookies used by Google Analytics store IP addresses, again for statistical purposes, but cannot be linked to an individual user via our website. This tool helps us to learn how you use the website and how we can improve it for you.

The majority of web browsers will give you the option to turn off or disable cookies by adjusting the settings of the browser. The instructions for this process can usually be found in the Help menu of the browser. However, please note that our website, as with most ecommerce sites, will lose functionality which means you may not be able to proceed with a purchase once cookies have been turned off. For further information about cookies please visit: [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/)

### The Information Collected

Our website collects data in a variety of forms, including cookies as mentioned above, using our online forms, through the purchase of products, and as site traffic information.

As a rule, we only collate information required to improve our service to you as a customer. All data requested by us is voluntary and you can provide us with as much or little information as you wish. For example, our e-Newsletters are for subscribers only and customers can unsubscribe at any time.

For the purposes of tracking traffic flow to and around the website, we store information including:-

  * The previous website visited, including any search terms used
  * Click stream data which shows the pages visited on the website
  * The type of web browser used by the website visitor
  * However none of this information can identify you personally. As already explained, we use Google Analytics to track and analyse these site statistics.



### How the Information Is Used

As mentioned above, we retain your information to improve our services and make the website as easy to use as possible.

We will only share the information outlined in ‘The Information Collected’ section above in the circumstances detailed below.

You should note that technical details, which we cannot associate with any identifiable individual, do not constitute "personal data" for the purposes of the Data Protection Acts, 1988 & 2003.

Any information provided by you will be kept in the strictest confidence, only authorised suppliers and personnel will have access to it. All persons with access to your data must comply with our privacy policy and adhere to our security measures against unauthorised or unlawful use of the information and against accidental loss, damage or destruction.
