**Privacy Policy**

Effective 2nd May 2006

Our basic policy is that we don't care who you are, but we keep track of what you do with our machines, and you will be responsible for anything you ask us to publish on your behalf. 

## Forms and comments 

This web site makes a reasonable effort to refrain from disclosing information submitted via forms (e.g. in comments and feedback). We cannot guarantee that accidents won't happen. If you are concerned about privacy and are unwilling to take the risk, simply do not provide your information. Private information is never a requirement for services provided here. 

## Browsing

The mere act of viewing pages on this site will not cause private information about you to be recorded. We do, however, record your IP address, the date and time your browse each page, and the URL of the page. We normally do not make this information available to the public - it is collected to provide statistical information about server usage, and to plan for future capacity. We may occasionally use "cookies" to temporarily identify your session in order to improve the quality of service we provide, but such cookie use will not cause any personal information about you to be disclosed to us. 

## EMail

No email addresses used either in contacting us or posting comments will be disclosed to any third party without your prior consent. 

## Advertisements

Advertisements apprearing on this site will have their own privacy policies provided by the agent of the advertisement. For Google Adsense ads see [Google's Full privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html)

## Other
