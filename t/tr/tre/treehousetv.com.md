# Privacy Policy | Treehouse

At [www.treehousetv.com](http://www.treehousetv.com/) (the "Site") we at Watch More TV Interactive Inc. and Treehouse TV, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc. (collectively, "Treehouse"), the operators of the Site, understand and appreciate the concerns that parents and families may have with regard to information gathered about Site users surfing our website, or on any other website.  

The Site gathers different kinds of information from its visitors in accordance with applicable privacy laws.

Please also make sure to read the Site’s [Terms of Use](http://www.treehousetv.com/page/terms-use) as it supplements and forms part of this Privacy Policy.

We understand and appreciate the concerns that parents and families may have, with regard to the information we gather about the users surfing our Site. For the purposes of this Policy, “parent” may mean parent or legal guardian of a child.

**_PERSONAL INFORMATION_**

On the Site, we may, on occasion, gather personal information from a user (e.g., name, phone number and/or email address), as part of a contest. There may be opportunities for Site users to enter a Treehouse contest directly via the Site. Any information that is collected for the purpose of a contest is used only to award prizes, to track compliance with the official rules and regulations and/or for internal feedback purposes. If Treehouse intends to use a winner's personally identifying information, such as a name or photograph, the contest winner is notified prior to use and the appropriate release forms must be completed by a user (or their parent/guardian) and returned.

Treehouse uses third party service providers to fulfill its contests, store data and execute mobile features. The information collected by these third party service providers is solely for the purpose of the contest fulfilment, data storage and execution of mobile features. All information received from our visitors remains the exclusive property of Treehouse and is not sold or distributed.  Once a user’s information is no longer required it is deleted, unless such user is already a member of our Site. Third party service providers are contractually bound to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information and are prohibited from using your personal information for any other purpose. 

**_OPT-IN/OPT-OUT_**

We do not sell or otherwise share personally identifiable information about individual users without the prior approval of the user. On the page where we ask for that information, there is a prominently displayed method to indicate to us that you do or do not want to receive promotional and/or marketing information about products, services and offerings. Check the appropriate box and your information may be used as described above. Leave it blank, and we consider it an opt-out. Either way, it is always your choice. User consent to use personal information can be withdrawn at any time by following the online instructions at <http://treehousetv.com/content/faq.aspx#Membership>.

**_GENERAL WEBSITE TRAFFIC_**

We at Treehouse keep track of total accesses to our Site. For example, we count how many times people access a particular page on the Site. All information gathered in this way is generic, and we do not track any individual users from this, but only calculate how many accesses have taken place.

**_COOKIE TECHNOLOGY_**

Cookies are small data files that your browser may place on your computer when you visit different Web sites to mark that you have been there. Cookie technology is used on our Site to maximize the website-browsing experience. For example, we use cookies to keep track of a user's time zone information which allows us to customize our schedule and give accurate show times. We also use cookies to keep track of a user's selections on the "My Favourites" page. No personal information is gathered from these cookies. However, you may choose to set up your browser to refuse cookies or alert you when cookies are sent. Please note, though, if you don't have a Treehouse cookie it may limit our ability to customize and improve our Site features.

**_EMAIL IDENTIFICATION_**

When a user sends a message to Treehouse through the Site, two pieces of information are automatically stamped on the message. These are the time that the message was sent, and the IP address it was sent from. This is done as a precaution against threatening emails we may receive towards Treehouse, its staff, or anyone else. It is only ever used to find the source of a message in those extreme cases where we feel someone's safety may be at risk.

**_LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITES_**

Please keep in mind that this Privacy Policy applies to the Site only. Occasionally, we may have links to other websites, including those of sponsors and partners. And although we do our best to ensure that these third parties share our views about privacy protection and safety, we don't have control over how they collect and use personal information from visitors. That's why always a good idea to check out another website's privacy policy and terms of use - even if you've linked to it from Treehouse.

**Access through Social Network Services or Mobile Devices**

The Site may permit you to link to other social media websites on the Internet (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Tumblr, among others) ("Social Media Sites"), and Social Media Sites may contain links to the Site. By accessing the Site through a Social Media Site, mobile device or other third party platform or service or by connecting to such a platform or service via the Site, you authorize us to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information that you agreed the Social Media Site, mobile device or other third party platform could provide to us through the social network/mobile device/third party platform Application Programming Interface (“API”) based on your settings on the Social Media Site, mobile device or platform. Your agreement is effective when you connect with the Social Media Site, device, platform or service via the Service, and/or when you connect, “accept” or “allow” (or similar terms) such service to access your information through the Social Media Site, mobile device or other third party platform or service. The use of third party applications developed using our API is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of such third party application developers. Be sure to review any available policies before submitting any personally identifiable information to a third party application or otherwise interacting with it.

 “ **Refer a Friend” or “Sharing Features**

If you choose to use a referral service to "tell a friend" about the Site, a specific article or feature on the Site, or a contest that is running, we may ask you for your friend’s name and email address (or in the case of friends who are under the age of majority in their province or territory of residence, the friend’s parent or legal guardian. We will then send your friend (or his or her parent or legal guardian) an email on your behalf inviting him or her to visit the relevant webpage or check out the Site. We store your friend's name and email for a short period for the sole purpose of sending this email and for redundancy checking, to be sure that your friend does not receive multiple copies of the same email message. We do not keep or use this information for any other purpose.

**_SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS_**

There are software programs that allow parents to block certain websites from their kids. Some programs are more flexible than others, so you may want to shop around to find one that you're comfortable with. We hope you and your children continue to enjoy your surfing experience on the Site
