# Trolltech - Trolltech Privacy Policy

Trolltech respects your privacy and is committed to protect the personal information that you share with us. Generally, you can browse through our website without giving us any information about yourself. When we do need your personal information to provide services that you request or when you choose to provide us with your personal information, this policy describes how we collect and use your personal information. 

### Information Collection

Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, email address, a home, postal or other physical address, other contact information, title, birth date, gender, occupation, industry, personal interests, other information when needed to provide a service you requested. 

When you browse our website, you do so anonymously, unless you have previously indicated that you wish Trolltech to remember your login and password. We do not automatically collect personal information, including your email address. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our website you visit and how long you spend there. We do not link your IP address to any personal information unless you have logged in to our website. Like many other commercial websites, the Trolltech website may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the site. 

Trolltech collects personal information when you register with Trolltech for a Trolltech account, when you use certain Trolltech products or services, when you register to attend a seminar or participate in an online survey, when you ask to be included in an email or other mailing list, or when you submit your personal information to Trolltech for any other reason. From time to time, Trolltech receives personal information from business partners and vendors. Trolltech only uses such information if it has been collected in accordance with acceptable privacy practices consistent with this Policy and applicable laws. 

Access to certain Trolltech web pages requires a login and a password. The use of those web pages, and the information or programs downloadable from those sites, may be governed by a written agreement between your employer and Trolltech. Unless you request deletion of your personal information as specified below, your personal information may be retained by Trolltech to verify compliance with the agreement, log software licenses granted, to track software downloaded from those pages, or track usage of other applications available on those pages. 

### Cookies and Tracking Technology

A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie cannot read data on your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Some parts of Trolltech's website use cookies to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information. 

If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser, although you may not be able to take full advantage of Trolltech's website if you do so. In particular, you may be required to accept cookies in order to complete certain actions on our website. You do not need to have cookies turned on, however, to use/navigate through many parts of our website, except access to certain of Trolltech's web pages may require a login and password. 

### How We Use Information Collected

Trolltech uses information for several general purposes: to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to personalize your experience on our website, to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, or other information we think you'd like to hear about either from us or from our business partners, and to better understand your needs and provide you with better services. We may also use your information to send you, direct marketing information or contact you for market research. 

### Information Sharing and Disclosure

Because Trolltech is a global company, your personal information may be shared with other Trolltech offices around the world. All such entities are governed by this Privacy Policy. Your personal information is never shared outside Trolltech without your permission, except under conditions explained below. Inside Trolltech, data is stored in controlled servers with limited access. Trolltech may send your personal information to other companies or people under the following circumstances: when we have your consent to share the information; we need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; we need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Trolltech to provide a product or service to you (we will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose); or we want to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, or other information we think you'd like to hear. We will also disclose your personal information if required to do so by law, or in urgent circumstances, to protect personal safety, the public or our websites. 

### Communications, Preferences and Opt-Out:

Trolltech allows visitors to self-select communities, through the registration process, as a way to provide initial customization to the Trolltech site. 

### Communications Choices

Trolltech recognizes that users may not wish to be contacted about new or related products. Trolltech.com allows you to opt-out of e-mail marketing that may result from use of the site. These choices may be made as part of the registration process or from links in marketing mailings. You may also always return to the registration profile to change your election relating to opt-out or by sending an email to our automated link [unsubscribe@trolltech.com](mailto:unsubscribe@trolltech.com). If you have any problems in using these opt-out mechanisms, please send an e-mail to [privacy@trolltech.com](mailto:privacy@trolltech.com), indicate opt-out in the subject line and specify what problem you have encountered in the body of the message. There are a few limited exceptions to the opt-out, but notice is provided that the service includes certain communications. These exceptions include: patch and product security update related communications, defined communications related to product download, specific communications that are part of the reason for a specific trading or user community - such as price/product related communications to the members of our partner network. 

### Third Party Opt-in Lists

On occasion, Trolltech may use a third party opt-in list. These are lists maintained by third parties that have received permission (opt-ins) from their users to receive e-mails from other companies, such as Trolltech. 

### Third Party Sites

Trolltech's website contains links to other sites. Trolltech does not share your personal information with those websites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those websites. 

Our website may contain links to websites operated by other companies. Some of these third-party sites may be co-branded with a Trolltech logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by Trolltech. Although we choose our business partners carefully, Trolltech is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites operated by third parties that are linked to our site. Once you have left our website, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party website to determine how they will handle any information they collect from you. 

### Children and Privacy

Our websites do not target and are not intended to attract children under the age of 13. Trolltech does not knowingly solicit personal information from children under the age of 13 or send them requests for personal information. 

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

Trolltech will amend this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information we will make that information available by posting a notice on this site. 

### Questions or Suggestions

If you have questions or concerns about our collection, use, or disclosure of your personal information, please email us at [privacy@trolltech.com](mailto:privacy@trolltech.com).
