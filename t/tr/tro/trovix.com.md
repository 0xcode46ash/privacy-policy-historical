Additionally, referring sites may pass us information about how you got to our site. We may also store the history of changes to your profile, of purchases from Trovix, and of information exchanges through the Service.



We use this information to help us provide, personalize and improve our Service. We may also use aggregated or anonymized information to describe our user base in marketing and sales materials, provided this information cannot be used to identify you. We may also use this information to select which advertisements to display to you. In this manner it may be accessed by our employees or contractors we work with.

We will use your information and documents as described above. If we need to use it in any other way, we will contact you, and you may then give or withhold your consent.

**Disclosure to third parties**

If you choose to post or publish information or send information to third parties through the Service, we will do so on your behalf. Trovix does not otherwise rent or sell any of your information to third parties except when we have your specific permission. These third parties may have a different privacy policy than Trovix, so we encourage you to review their privacy policies prior to sharing your information if you have concerns.

As a rule, we will not give away information or documents or browsing history that personally identify you, except when we have your permission. However, in some situations we may need to disclose information to third parties:

  1. 1\. If required by law, or to comply with subpoenas or court orders, or to defend against legal claims, or to exercise or establish our legal rights;
  2. 2\. If we believe it is necessary to protect our users against illegal activities or suspected fraud, or to prevent such activities, in situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of a person, or in cases involving violations of Trovix’s [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20101113145135id_/http%3A//www.trovix.com/about/terms.jsp);
  3. 3\. As stated on the Trovix site when the information was collected.
  4. 4\. Trovix may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. Trovix will notify you before transferring your information to a new entity as part of a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of some or all of its assets if the new entity's processing of your information will materially differ from that set forth in this Privacy Policy.



**Aggregate information**

We may aggregate anonymous user data including browsing history in order to understand usage patterns of the Service and improve our Service. We may also use this aggregated data in publicly describing our Service or may share it with third parties. Such aggregated data does not contain any information that can be used to identify individual users.

**Trovix communications with you**

We will communicate with our users through email and our website. We may contact you with news and updates, opportunities, and other information relevant to the Service and your usage of it. We may also send you some promotional information unless you opted out of receiving such emails.

**Third party sites**

Trovix may include links to other sites. These sites have their own privacy policies which users are encouraged to read. Trovix is not responsible for the privacy policies of these sites nor the use of information submitted on those sites.

**Accessing and modifying your information**

Users can view, correct, update, or delete any personal information submitted to the Service at any time by logging in to their accounts. Any deleted information becomes immediately unavailable for use within the Trovix website; however, deleted information may remain in back-up storage for some period of time after deletion. We also have no control over any previous disclosures to third parties that you had authorized us to make.
