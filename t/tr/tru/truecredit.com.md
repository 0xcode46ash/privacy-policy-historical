**The Collection of Information**
  
You browse the TrueLink web site anonymously. We do track which pages of our site you visit and note the address of your server (as all web sites do automatically), but do not gather any information about you as an individual. The general information we gather enables us to serve you better by continually improving our site based on up-to-date use patterns. 

When you purchase one of our products online, we collect information necessary for authentication and billing. To process your order we need your full name and current address, your email address (in case we need to contact you due to a problem with your order), and a valid credit card. If you are signing up for the CreditMonitor, we need your email address, in order to notify you when your credit report is ready to view. For orders involving credit reports, we need your Social Security number, as we must have this information to obtain your credit report for you. We may ask for your date of birth, previous address, employment information, and/or account information so that we can verify your identity before delivering your credit report. 

All of this information is then moved to a secure computer by means of a one-way transfer on our proprietary network. TrueLink has been certified by the International Computer Security Association. So you can be confident that your credit card number and identifying information are safely and securely stored. 

The information you provide us when you place an order is used to fulfill that order. If you become a member of one of our monitoring services you will receive the reports and notifications described in the product specifications. You will also receive emails notifying you when your reports are ready online. If you order a single report, you will receive only that report. 

TrueLink knows how imperative it is that sensitive information about you remains confidential, and we do not release any sensitive information (such as credit card numbers) about our customers to any third party. 

To update your personal information with TrueLink, login to the web site and choose "User Information" from the Main Menu.
