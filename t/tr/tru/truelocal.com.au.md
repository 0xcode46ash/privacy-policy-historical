Where your personal information is contained within an advertisement that we publish for you, we may also use your information for publication of that same advertisement in other media. This includes providing the information in the advertisement to our syndication partners so that they can publish the advertisement on the websites and other media services that they operate.

### Do you capture information through my computer’s web browser?

Our aim is to make using TrueLocal as easy to access and use as possible. One way to do this is to collect certain non-personal information from your computer that helps our web pages work better on your PC. For example the type of information we might collect would be the identity of your internet browser, the type of operating system you use, your IP address and the domain name of your internet service provider. This information would also be used to optimise our goods and services (which may include the display of personalised content and advertising) including our web pages.

In addition, we may use personally identifiable information in aggregate form to improve our services. This statistical compilation and analysis of information may also be used by TrueLocal or provided to others as a summary report for marketing, advertising or research purposes.

### Is my personal information secure?

Rest assured we make every effort to ensure your security, integrity and privacy. This entails using a variety of security measures such as restricting physical access to our offices and using firewalls and secure databases to keep personal information safe from misuse, loss, unauthorised use and disclosure. Bear in mind though that nobody can guarantee total security for data transmitted over the internet.

### Can I access the personal information you have about me?
