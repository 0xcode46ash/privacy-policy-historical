### What information are you collecting about me?

The sort of information we collect includes such things as your name, address, telephone number, and in some instances, your financial details. When you are online, we collect information regarding the pages within our network that you have visited and what you click on.

This information is collected as we provide our services to you. We’ll always tell you why we are collecting information when we collect it and how we plan to use it.

As a general rule we don’t collect sensitive information. However, if we do, it will usually be essential to providing our services. If the law requires us to, we’ll seek your consent to collect this information.

We usually collect personal information directly from you although sometimes we may use agents or service providers to do this for us. We may also get lists from other sources, both from other companies and from other public documents.

### How do you use the information I give you?

We use your information to provide our services to you, to fulfill administrative functions associated with these services (for example, billing), to enter into contracts with you or third parties and for marketing and client relationship purposes.

Where your personal information is contained within an advertisement that we publish for you, we may also use your information for publication of that same advertisement in other media, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the initial publication.

We may share your information with other companies related to TrueLocal provided it is within Australia. We or they may also use your personal information to help us improve our products and services and any of us might be in touch to let you know about goods, services, or promotions that may interest you.

### Do you give information to third parties?

Yes, TrueLocal may give your information to service providers and contractors to help us provide and promote our goods and services to you. We may also share your information with third parties who provide prizes for competitions or reader offers. If we do this we require these parties protect your information the same way we do.

### Do you capture information through my computer’s web browser?

Our aim is to make using TrueLocal as easy to access and use as possible. One way to do this is to collect certain non-personal information from your computer that helps our web pages work better on your PC. For example the type of information we might collect would be the identity of your internet browser, the type of operating system you use, your IP address and the domain name of your internet service provider. This information would only be used for internal purposes.

In addition, we may use personally identifiable information in aggregate form to improve our services. This statistical compilation and analysis of information may also be used by TrueLocal or provided to others as a summary report for marketing, advertising or research purposes.

### Is my personal information secure?

Rest assured we make every effort to ensure your security, integrity and privacy. This entails using a variety of security measures such as restricting physical access to our offices and using firewalls and secure databases to keep personal information safe from misuse, loss, unauthorised use and disclosure. Bear in mind though that nobody can guarantee total security for data transmitted over the internet.

### Can I access the personal information you have about me?

Yes you have the right to access most personal information we hold about you. Just get in touch with the Privacy Officer.

If there’s any reason why we can’t disclose any information, we’ll always let you know.

### What about information I provide in public areas such as forums?

Any information posted on bulletin boards, in Ratings & Reviews and/or communicated in chat areas becomes public information by its nature. While we strive to protect and respect your privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose in these areas.

### What else should I know about internet privacy?
