# TrueDelta | Privacy Policy

TrueDelta takes your privacy very seriously.

Panel members supply an email address in order to take part in the research. This email address will never be provided to a third party (aside from email management services TrueDelta might use to send and receive email) without your express consent with regard to a specific offer. We hate spam as much as anyone, and will never provide mailing lists to third parties.

Panel members also provide information about themselves and their vehicles, both via the standard forms and, in some cases, personal email. All such information becomes the property of TrueDelta. That said, none of this information (names, license plates, addresses, etc.) will ever be published or otherwise publicly released in a form that it can be connected to the individual member or vehicle.

For example, while responses to the fuel economy and repair history surveys are posted directly to the site, the posted results include no way to identify the specific vehicle they pertain to or the person who provided the data.

TrueDelta does not provide data to Carfax, Autocheck, or any other such services that provide information on individual cars.

There is one exception to this policy. As stated on the panel registration form, TrueDelta reserves the right to contact the appropriate department of motor vehicles (DMV) or equivalent to verify the existence of a vehicle in the panel. Even in this case no information will be provided to the DMV that the DMV does not already possess.

This policy covers how TrueDelta handles the personal information it collects. This includes information that you provide directly via various forms or email and indirectly by using the site (vehicles compared, pages viewed, etc.).

This policy does not apply to any of the websites or companies that TrueDelta links to or otherwise affliates with but does not own or control.

Once you have submitted information and it is received in TrueDelta's database, all submitted information becomes the property of TrueDelta.

Some advertisers use cookies and other means to track your Internet use in compliance with Internet browser security rules. Information includes clickstream data, browswer type, time and date, subject of ads clicked on or ignored. They use this information to decide which ads to present to you. The Network Advertising Initiative has an opt out page [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

By using the TrueDelta site and providing us with your information, you agree to the TrueDelta Privacy Policy. If you do not accept this policy, please do not use this site.

TrueDelta reserves the right to modify this policy at any time. Please periodically check this page for changes. Continued use of the site implied that you accept any changes.
