# Trunk Club - Privacy Policy

This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting trunkclub.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.

What personal information about customers does Trunk Club and Trunkclub.com gather?

The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your experience with our service. Here are the types of information we gather:

  


### Information You Give Us:

We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. We use the information to respond to your requests, customizing your shopping experience, improving our service, and communicating with you.

  


### Automatic Information:

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use “cookies,” and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses trunkclub.com

  


### Email Communications:

We may receive confirmation when you open email from Trunk Club if your computer supports such capabilities. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please contact us at service@trunkclub.com and we will promptly remove you from our mailing lists.

  


### Does Trunk Club share the information it receives?

We do not sell or share information about our customers, except in the specific cases described here:

  


#### Third-Party Service Providers:

We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, developing systems, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

  


#### Business Transfers:

As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless the customer consents otherwise). In the event that Trunk Club or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets.

  


#### Protection of Trunk Club and Others:

We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, or protect the rights, property, or safety of Trunk Club employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. This does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.

  


#### With Your Consent:

Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

  


### How secure is information about me?

We work to protect the security of your information during order transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts order information you transmit. We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.

  


### What about links to other Web sites?

Our Web sites might include links to third-party Web sites. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer information to these Web sites.

  


### Which information can I access?

Trunkclub.com gives you access to information about your account and your interactions with Trunkclub.com for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.

  


### What choices do I have?

You can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please contact us at service@trunkclub.com or call us at (312) 266-8700 between 9 and 6 PM Central time to be promptly removed from our lists.

  


### What are Cookies?

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing add-on settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer.

  


### Are children allowed to use Trunk Club and Trunkclub.com?

Trunk Club does not sell products for purchase by children. If you are under 18, you may use Trunk Club and Trunkclub.com only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.

  


### Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions

If you choose to visit Trunk Club, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice including limitations on damages, disputes, and choice of law. If you have any concern about privacy at Trunk Club, please email service@trunkclub.com and we will work to address it.

Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice will change also. You should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.

Thanks for reading this far.
