# Trumba Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy

###### Last Updated: February 25, 2005

#### Introduction to Privacy Policy

The Trumba Service is a web-based software application designed to help families, individuals, and colleagues more efficiently plan and run their lives. Trumba grew out of our founders’ desire to organize family members involved in numerous school, sports, entertainment, and work activities. 

Trumba Service is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information you voluntarily submit through your use of Trumba Service. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies or other entities that Trumba Service does not own or control (see Your Acceptance of Our Privacy Policy Terms). If you link to another web site from the Trumba web site, please consult that site's privacy policy. 

This privacy policy describes the personal information we collect, why we collect it, and explains how it is used. By using the Trumba Service, you agree to the collection and use of your personal information as described below. You also agree to abide by the terms described in the Terms of Use agreement.

#### General Guidelines

  * We will provide aggregate or combined user statistics to partners without disclosing any personally identifiable information.

#### Orders

If you purchase products or services, we may briefly redirect you to an e-commerce transaction partner, who will ask for billing information from you on their order form. This information may include name, email, billing address and financial information such as credit card number, and expiration date. Once your transaction is complete, you will be returned to the Trumba web site. Please read the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use of all third-party web sites.

Trumba does not collect nor store any financial information about you.

#### Calendar Data

Any event information you enter in a published “public” calendar can potentially be viewed by anyone, unless you choose to restrict access via Trumba privacy settings. Trumba provides a number of different privacy levels allowing you to share none, some, or all of your calendar information with select groups or individuals. Unpublished calendars can also be shared in a manner specified by you.

You can also upload an image to published calendars. Your image will be displayed with your calendar and available to others according to the privacy settings that you choose.

#### Trumba Email Products

Trumba provides opt-in email subscriptions to help enhance the service we provide. These products include: 

  * **Welcome Email** — Based on the email address you supplied when you registered, we will send you a one-time welcome email to verify your user name and password. You must activate your account through this email. 
  * **Unsubscribe** — Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option to opt-out of email communications. We provide unsubscribe links within Trumba email products and within the web site. Please visit your account preferences page to opt out of email subscriptions. 
  * **Service-Related Announcements** — We may send you service-related email announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is suspended for maintenance. Since these emails are not promotional in nature, you may not opt-out of these communications. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account. 
  * **Tell a Friend Email** — If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, or to forward event information, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Trumba stores this information for the sole purposes of sending this one-time email, tracking the success of our referral program, storing email preferences, and for providing our members with a list of most frequently “mailed to” friends. Your friend may request to not receive future email from Trumba by clicking on a link included in the email sent to them. 
  * **Market Research Surveys** — If you choose to opt in, we may occasionally contact customers who purchase products or services from Trumba Corporation for market research and/or customer satisfaction surveys or new product announcements offered by Trumba Corporation.



#### Cookies

A cookie is a unique identifier sent to a user's computer during a visit to a web site. Cookies can be used to remember information such as user name and password (so you don't have to enter them each time you visit our site). 

If you choose the option “Automatically sign me in on this computer,” Trumba will use one persistent cookie to store your user name and password so you don’t have to enter it on repeat visits. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “Help” file. However if you configure your browser or choose to reject cookies, you may only use a portion of our web site including “Add To My Calendar” and viewing a public calendar. To best experience Trumba you need cookies enabled. 

We use cookies to:

  * Automatically log you into the service when you return 
  * Access your site preferences and deliver you the appropriate calendar content 
  * Deliver content or advertising specific to you based on location and/or preferences



This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by www.trumba.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

#### Log Files

We gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and requested URLs.

How we use the information captured in log files:

  * To help diagnose problems with our servers 
  * To administer our web site 
  * To gather aggregate demographic information 
  * To understand which pages are most popular on our site



#### Third-Party Advertisers

Our advertising partners deliver the advertisements appearing on the Trumba web site. Our arrangements with the advertisers do not require us to share any personally-identifiable information about our users.

#### Links to Other Sites

The Trumba web site may contain links to other third-party sites that are not owned or controlled by Trumba Corporation. Please be aware that Trumba Corporation is not responsible for the privacy practices of other such sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy policy of every web site that collects personally identifiable information. 

#### Access to Personally Identifiable Information

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate your account by changing your account settings directly or by contacting us by postal mail at the following address:

#### Security

Trumba Service secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure on offline computer servers in a controlled, secure environment. If it is necessary to transmit personal information, industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encrypted protection is used.

Email, which is different from the SSL encrypted transmissions described above, is not secure. Therefore, do not send confidential information such as social security or account numbers via an unsecured email message. Send confidential information via U.S. mail to: 

Trumba Corporation  
Attn: Confidential  
1420 Fifth Avenue, Suite 4400  
Seattle, WA 98101

To prevent unauthorized access of your information, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect through this web site. For example, only a limited set of employees have access to user accounts for the purposes of customer service and accounts and log data are not viewed by a human unless there is a security, audit or internal business purpose.

If you have any questions about security on our web site, you can email us at [privacy@corp.trumba.com](mailto:privacy@corp.trumba.com)

#### Surveys or Contests

From time-to-time, we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you decide to participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is voluntary and you may choose whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as ZIP code).

We use aggregated anonymous information collected through customer surveys and site statistics to improve the products and services we offer. We do not connect this data to any personally identifiable information we have collected.

We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you clear prior notice and an explicit choice to opt-in, and you choose to opt in to sharing such information.

#### Our Commitment to Children's Privacy

Protecting the privacy of the children is especially important to Trumba Services. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our web site from those we actually know are under 13 years of age, and no part of our web site is structured to attract anyone under 13 years of age.

#### Changes in this Privacy Statement

If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time.
