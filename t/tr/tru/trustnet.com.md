Trustnet respects your right to privacy on the internet and will not sell or make available in any way individually identifiable personal information without first receiving your permission. 

The nature of services provided by Trustnet means that we may need to gather information about you to enable us to provide services which are tailored to your specific interests. 

When you are asked to select an investor type (e.g. Private investor), Trustnet makes a record of your choice and puts a cookie on your computer to ensure that you receive content which is designed to suit your requirements, and complies with the rules set down by the FSA about the type of information we can supply to different types of investor. 

Information about your personal selection will not be shared with any third party under any circumstances. 

You have the right to be informed of the existence and use of the personal information Trustnet maintains on you. Upon written request, Trustnet will provide access to such information. If you are concerned that any of the information we hold on you is inaccurate or incomplete you shall be able to challenge it and have it amended as appropriate. 

Under the Data Protection Act 1984 Trustnet is registered in the Register of Data Users And Computer Bureaux with the Data Protection Registrar. Both the Act and our registration with the Data Protection Registrar place us under obligations of confidentiality to you. 

When you register and use the site, we will ask you to provide certain data. We will store this information and use it to contact you, provide you with details of services of interest to you and otherwise constantly improve our content by tracking group information that describes the habits, usage patterns and demographics of our customers. We may also gather details of your operating system, browser version, domain name and IP address and the details of the web site you came from to enable us to improve this site. 

We will not disclose your name or postal address or any data that could identify you to any third party without first receiving your permission. 

In order to analyse site traffic and to provide personalised services, we use a feature of your browser called Cookies. Our Cookies pose no security risk to you at all. They contain information such as your user id, name and investor type. Cookies also contain your session identifiers to enable Trustnet to identify whether you are registered on to the site and, if so, to shortcut your access to the site. 

We endeavour to take all reasonable steps to protect the personal information we hold on you including the use of encryption, but cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online. You accept the inherent security implications of dealing online over the internet and will not hold Trustnet responsible for any breach of security unless we have been negligent or in wilful default. 

E-mail addresses are required in order to register for some features on Trustnet.com. We will not pass on your e-mail address to any third party without your permission. Occasionally, we will send you e-mail to provide information and keep you up to date with developments on Trustnet. In every e-mail we send, it is our policy to have instructions on how to unsubscribe so that you will not receive any future e-mails. You can change your e-mail address at any time. 

Our site may link to other web sites and we are not responsible for their data policies or procedures or their content. 

We have certain responsibilities under Money Laundering legislation to verify the identity of clients and may need to make certain enquiries and obtain certain information from you for that purpose. You confirm that all information you supply will be accurate and that we may pass on such information as we consider necessary to comply with any reporting requirements. 

You agree that we may disclose to any regulatory authority to which we are subject and to any investment exchange on which we may deal or to its related clearing house (or to investigators, inspectors or agents appointed by them), or to any person empowered to require such information by or under any legal enactment, any information they may request or require relating to you or, if relevant, any of your clients.
