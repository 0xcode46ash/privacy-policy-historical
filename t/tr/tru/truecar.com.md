# TrueCar Privacy Policy

TrueCar, Inc. (“TrueCar”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) is an online automotive information and communications platform (“Service”). TrueCar operates the Service on http://www.truecar.com and on TrueCar’s partner websites.

This Privacy Policy describes TrueCar’s collection, use and sharing of personally identifiable information, which may include your first and last name, email address, mailing address, or telephone number, you voluntarily provide when using the Service (“PII”) through our website or through our partner websites. This Privacy Policy also explains how we collect, use and share information based on your interactions with advertisements on websites where the Service is available. 

The Service is hosted in the United States and is available on general audience websites, which are not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13). TrueCar does not knowingly collect PII from individuals under thirteen (13) years of age. 

## Collection of Information

If you browse through our website or through our partner website pages on which the Service appears without providing us any PII, we may gather and store information about your visit, such as your IP address, type of browser and operating system used, date and time you access the websites, pages you visit, and if you linked to this website from another website, the address of that website. This information will not identify you and is therefore considered “Non-PII”.

## Use and Sharing of Information

The PII we receive from you through the Internet may be used or shared by us with third parties including dealers, marketing businesses, lead generation businesses, our partners who make the Service available on their web pages, and our corporate affiliates (collectively “Affiliates”). In addition, there may be instances when TrueCar may access or disclose PII or Non-PII, including under the following circumstances: (i) to protect or defend the legal rights or property of TrueCar and its Affiliates; (ii) to protect the safety and security of users of the Services or members of the public including acting in urgent circumstances; (iii) to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or (iv) to comply with applicable law or legal process. In addition, if TrueCar sells all or part of its business or sells or transfers all or a material part of its assets, or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business, we may transfer your PII or Non-PII to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.

## Cookies, Beacons, and Pixel Tags

From time to time, we may place cookies and web beacons on your computer to collect anonymous data related to your use of our website and your use of the pages of our partner websites on which the Service is available, including website usage analytics, and content and advertising personalization. “Cookies” are small identifiers sent from a web server that are stored on your computer’s hard drive for the purpose of identifying your browser during interaction on websites. Cookies may be used to store items such as identifiers and user preferences. A website may set a cookie to the web browser if the web browser's preferences allow it. A web browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has set, not those set by other websites. “Web beacons” are invisible electronic images, called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF, which can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. 

We may allow third parties to collect the anonymous data received from cookies and web beacons on our behalf, and to retain and use this data themselves. In addition, we may share this anonymous data with other third parties. To protect your privacy, we do not use cookies or web beacons to store or transmit any PII about you. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser’s setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, certain features of our website or the web pages on our partner websites may not function properly or not at all as a result. You may render some web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies.

## Analytics Service Providers

We may allow certain third-party analytics service providers to include web beacons within the pages of this website and within the pages of our partner websites on which the Service is available. We may also share portions of our log file data, including IP addresses, with these service providers for analytics purposes. These service providers aggregate information about what you see and interact with on our website and on the pages of our partner websites on which the Service is available.

These service providers offer information about their data collection practices, and in some cases, an opt-out, on their respective websites. We allow web beacons from and share log file data with the following service providers; please click below to visit their websites and their privacy policy to better understand the controls available to you.

[Visual Sciences/SiteCatalyst HBX](http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/visualsciences/policy#optout)

None of the PII that you provide to us when using this website or the Service is shared with our third party analytics service providers or advertisers as part of our analytics programs.

## Applications and Widgets

We may include an application or widget from a third party on some pages of this website and on some of the pages of our partner websites on which the Service is available that allows interaction or content sharing by users. “Widgets” are mini-programs that provide specific services or content from a third party. These widgets, such as a Facebook “Share” or “Like” button, are visible to you on the webpage you visit. The third party providing the widget may offer controls for you to manage the widget’s appearance and functionality. Your interaction with a widget typically allows the third party to collect some information about you through the third party’s cookies or its registration information. In some cases, the third party may recognize you through its widgets and cookies even when you do not interact with the widget. Please visit the following third-parties’ respective privacy policy to better understand their data collection practices and controls they make available to you (click to visit their websites):

## Advertisements, Ad Networks and Other Third Parties

We may allow certain third-party companies to serve advertisements to you and collect anonymous information regarding your use of this website and your use of the pages of our partner websites on which the Service is available. Typically, these companies are third party ad servers, ad agencies, technology vendors, providers of sponsored content and research firms, and they may include a web beacon within this website or within the pages of our partner websites on which the Service is available to provide customization, auditing, research and reporting for us, our partners, and advertisers. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and/or web beacons from the third-party’s web servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a webpage from their website directly. These companies may also use these cookies or web beacons to collect information on the website pages we host to deliver you customized content and/or ads on both this and other websites.

We may customize some ads tailored to your interests when you visit certain pages of this website and certain pages of our partner websites on which the Service is available, but we do not provide any PII to an advertiser when you interact with or view a customized advertisement. However, when you view or interact with an advertisement, the possibility exists that the advertiser will make the assumption that you are interested in the subject matter of the advertisements.

The following third parties offer information about their data collection practices, and in some cases, an opt-out, on their respective websites (click to visit their websites). Please visit each company’s respective privacy policy to better understand the controls available to you. You can also learn more about ad serving companies and opt-out from each of them at the [Network Advertising Initiative website](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) or the [Digital Advertising Alliance website](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). 

Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. If you use the Service, you will continue to receive generic advertisements. If you wish to opt-out of receiving generic advertisements from us, please see our Opt-Out Policy below.

## Links

The Services may contain links to websites or web pages not operated by TrueCar. The Services may also carry advertisements from third party companies not associated with TrueCar. TrueCar is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites or web pages or other services operated by third parties that are linked to or integrated with the Services or for the privacy practices of third party advertising companies. Once you leave the Services via such a link, access a third party application (such as widgets) or click on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine, among other things, how they will handle any PII they collect from you.

## Security

TrueCar uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel, and physical security measures designed to safeguard PII in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification. In addition, TrueCar uses reasonable methods in an effort to make sure that the PII we store about you is consistent with the updated information you provide to us. 

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

From time to time TrueCar may modify this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and use practices, changes in the features of the Service, or technology, and such modifications shall be effective upon posting by TrueCar on this website. 

Your continued use of the Service after TrueCar posts a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. Therefore, it is important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes. 

If TrueCar materially changes its practices regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the Privacy Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the change. Our Privacy Policy was last updated on and is effective as of April 26, 2012.
