# TrueCar Privacy Policy

TrueCar, Inc. (“TrueCar”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) is an online and mobile automotive information and communications platform (“Service”) for consumers. TrueCar operates the Service on the www.truecar.com and related subdomains, on the TrueCar mobile application(s), and on and/or TrueCar’s partner websites.

This Privacy Policy describes TrueCar’s collection, use and sharing of your personally identifiable information (“PII”), which may include your first and last name, email address, mailing address (including your city and state), zip code, telephone number, geo-location, your automobile's vehicle identification number (“VIN”) or license plate number, or your vehicle condition, that you voluntarily provide when using the Service through our website, through the TrueCar mobile application(s), or through our partner websites. This Privacy Policy also explains how we collect, use and share information based on your interactions with advertisements on websites and/or applications as a result of your use of the Service.

The Service is hosted in the United States and is not directed towards individuals under the age of thirteen (13). TrueCar does not knowingly collect PII from individuals under thirteen (13) years of age.

## Collection of Information

If you browse through our websites or through our partner website pages on which the Service appears or use our mobile application(s) without providing us any PII, we may gather and store information about your visit, such as your IP address, type of browser and operating system used, date and time you accessed the website or application(s), pages you visit, how you used the application(s), and if you linked to these websites from another website, or the address of that website. This information will not identify you, and is therefore considered “Non-PII.”

## Use and Sharing of Information

The PII we receive from you through your use of the Service may be used or shared by us with third parties, including dealers, automobile manufactures, marketing businesses, lead generation businesses, email service providers, our partners who make the Service available on their web pages, and our corporate affiliates (collectively, “Affiliates”). These third parties are authorized to use the PII we may share only to the extent necessary to provide their respective services.

In addition, there may be instances when TrueCar may access or disclose PII or Non-PII, including under the following circumstances to: (i) protect or defend the legal rights or property of TrueCar and/or its Affiliates; (ii) protect the safety, security, and privacy of users of the Services or members of the public including acting in urgent circumstances; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or (iv) comply with applicable law or legal process. In addition, if TrueCar sells all or part of its business or sells or transfers all or a material part of its assets, or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business, we may transfer your PII or Non-PII to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.

## Cookies and Beacons

From time to time, we may place cookies and web beacons on your computer to collect anonymous data related to your use of the Service. This anonymous data provides us with website usage analytics and allows us to provide personalized advertising. We may also use these cookies and web beacons to provide personalized advertising on other websites you visit after using our Service. “Cookies” are small identifiers sent from a web server that are stored on your computer’s hard drive for the purpose of identifying your browser during interaction on websites. Cookies are also used to identify your mobile application(s) and interaction with that application. Cookies may be used to store items such as identifiers and user preferences. A website may set a cookie to the web browser if the web browser's preferences allow it. A web browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has set, and not those set by other websites. “Web beacons” are invisible electronic images, called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF, that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed.

We may allow third parties to collect the anonymous data received from cookies and web beacons on our behalf, and to retain and use this data themselves; however we do not have access or control over these cookies, and the use of cookies by these third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy. In addition, we may share this anonymous data with other third parties. To protect your privacy, we do not use cookies or web beacons to store or transmit any PII about you. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser’s setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, certain features of our website or the web pages on our partner websites may not function properly or not at all as a result. You may render some web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies. 

## Analytics Service Providers

We may allow certain third-party analytics service providers to include web beacons within the pages of this website and within the pages of our partner websites on which the Service is available. We may also share portions of our log file data, including IP addresses, with these service providers for analytics purposes. These service providers aggregate information about what you see and interact with on our website and on the pages of our partner websites on which the Service is available.

We may also allow certain third-party analytics providers to utilize cookies that identify the TrueCar application that you are using and how you use that application. These third parties help us understand your usage of the different aspects of the application, such as user behavior, effectiveness of the application to allow us to make future improvements to the application, and effectiveness of the promotion channels that are used in the application.

These service providers offer information about their data collection practices, and in some cases, an opt-out, on their respective websites. To obtain a list of these service providers in order to request their privacy policy information, please email us at [privacy@truecar.com](mailto:privacy@truecar.com).

None of the PII that you provide to us when using the Service is shared with our third party analytics service providers or advertisers as part of our analytics programs.

## Third Party Applications and Widgets

We may include third-party applications or widgets on some pages of this website and on some of the pages of our partner websites on which the Service is available that allows interaction or content sharing by users. “Widgets” are mini-programs that provide specific services or content from a third party. These widgets, such as a Facebook “Share” or “Like” button, are visible to you on the web page you visit. Your interaction with an application or widget typically allows these third parties to collect some information about you through their cookies or through their registration process. In some cases, the third parties may recognize you through their applications, widgets and/or cookies even when you do not interact with the particular application or widget. The third parties providing the applications or widgets may offer controls for you to manage the applications or widgets’ appearance and functionality, and offer information about their data collection practices, and in some cases, an opt-out, on their respective websites. To obtain a list of these third parties in order to request their privacy policy information, please email us at [privacy@truecar.com](mailto:privacy@truecar.com).

## Single Sign-On

You can log in to our website, and may in some cases, our partner websites, using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain PII with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our membership form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your TrueCar activities to your Facebook profile page to share with others within your Facebook network.

## Advertisements, Ad Networks and Other Third Parties

We may allow certain third-party companies to serve advertisements to you and collect anonymous information regarding your use of this website and your use of the pages of our partner websites on which the Service is available. Typically, these companies are third-party ad servers, ad agencies, technology vendors, providers of sponsored content and research firms, and they may include a web beacon within this website or within the pages of our partner websites on which the Service is available to provide customization, auditing, research and reporting for us, our partners, and/or advertisers. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and/or web beacons from the third-party’s web servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their website directly. These companies may also use these cookies or web beacons to collect information on the website pages we host to deliver you customized content and/or ads on both this and other websites.

We may customize some ads tailored to your interests when you visit certain pages of this website and certain pages of our partner websites on which the Service is available, but we do not provide any PII to an advertiser when you interact with or view a customized advertisement. However, when you view or interact with an advertisement, the possibility exists that the advertiser will make the assumption that you are interested in the subject matter of the advertisement.

While you may have set your browser to Do Not Track, TrueCar’s technology will not respond to that setting at this time. The above third-party companies offer information about their data collection practices, and in some cases, an opt-out, on their respective websites. To obtain a list of these third parties in order to request their privacy policy information, please email us at [privacy@truecar.com](mailto:privacy@truecar.com). You can also learn more about ad serving companies and opt-out from certain of them at the [Network Advertising Initiative website](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) or the [Digital Advertising Alliance website](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. If you use the Service, you will continue to receive generic advertisements.

## Links

The Service may contain links to websites or web pages not operated by TrueCar. The Service may also carry advertisements from third party companies not associated with TrueCar. TrueCar is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites or web pages or other services operated by third parties that are linked to or integrated with the Service, or for the privacy practices of third-party advertising companies. Once you leave the Service via such a link, access a third party application (such as widgets), or click on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine, among other things, how they handle any PII they collect from you.

## Blog/Comments

The blog section of www.truecar.com offers visitors the ability to provide publicly accessible comments to the blogs we post. We require and, therefore, collect your email address and name if you chose to post a comment. The information you provide including the content of your post in this area may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. If you would like to remove a posting you have made, please contact us at [privacy@truecar.com](mailto:privacy@truecar.com).

## Security

TrueCar uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel, and physical security measures designed to safeguard PII in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification. In addition, TrueCar uses reasonable methods in an effort to ensure that the PII we store about you is consistent with the updated information you provide to us.

## User Access and Choice

You may change or update your personally identifiable information which you have provided us by accessing the “My Account” tab after signing into your account on www.truecar.com. You may also deactivate your account by contacting [privacy@truecar.com](mailto:privacy@truecar.com). If you choose to return to use the Service after deactivating your account, we may utilize some of the information you previously provided us or a partner in order to provide you with the Service.

## Retention of Information

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active, as needed to provide you Services, or pursuant to our document retention policies. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal and/or financial obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

From time-to-time, TrueCar may modify this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and use practices, changes in the features of the Service or technology, and such modifications shall be effective upon posting by TrueCar on this website.

Your continued use of the Service after TrueCar posts a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. Therefore, it is important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes.

If TrueCar materially changes its practices regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the Privacy Policy under which it was originally collected unless you have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the change by email (sent to the email address you have provided to us), or by means of notice on this website or the pages of our partner websites on which the Service is available on the effective date of the change(s).

Our Privacy Policy was last updated and is effective as of July 10, 2014
