## Cookies, Beacons, and Pixel Tags

From time to time, we may place cookies and web beacons on your personal computer to collect anonymous data related to your use of this website, including website usage analytics, and content and advertising personalization. "Cookies" are small identifiers sent from a web server that are stored on your computer's hard drive for the purpose of identifying your browser during interaction on websites. Cookies may be used to store items such as identifiers and user preferences. A website may set a cookie to the web browser if the web browser's preferences allow it. A web browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has set, not those set by other websites. "Web beacons" are invisible electronic images, called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF, which can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed.

As set forth in more detail below, we may allow third parties to collect the anonymous data received from cookies and web beacons on our behalf, and to retain and use this data themselves. In addition, we may share this anonymous data with other third parties. To protect your privacy, we do not use cookies or web beacons to store or transmit any PII about you on the Internet. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser's setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, certain features of this website may not function properly or not at all as a result. You may render some web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies.

## Analytics Service Providers

We may allow certain third-party analytics service providers to include web beacons within the pages of this website. We may also share portions of our log file data, including IP addresses, with these service providers for analytics purposes. These service providers aggregate information about what you see and interact with on this website, and then provide auditing, research and reporting for us and our advertisers. In addition, these service providers offer information about their data collection practices, and in some cases, an opt-out, on their respective websites. Please visit each partner's privacy policy to better understand the controls available to you. We allow web beacons from and share log file data with the following service providers (click to visit their websites):

## Applications and Widgets

We may include an application or widget from a third party on some pages of this website that allows interaction or content sharing by users. "Widgets" are mini-programs that provide specific services or content from a third party. These widgets, such as a Facebook "Share" or "Like" button, are visible to you on the webpage you visit. The third party providing the widget may offer controls for you to manage the widget's appearance and functionality. Your interaction with a widget typically allows the third party to collect some information about you through the third party's cookies or its registration information.

## Advertisements, Ad Networks and Other Third Parties

We allow certain third-party companies to serve advertisements to you and collect anonymous information regarding your use of this website. Typically, these companies are third party ad servers, ad agencies, technology vendors, providers of sponsored content and research firms, and they may include a web beacon within this website to provide customization, auditing, research and reporting for us and advertisers. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and/or web beacons from the third-party's web servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a webpage from their website directly. These companies may also use these cookies or web beacons to collect information on the website pages we host to deliver you customized content and/or ads on both this and other websites.

We may customize some ads tailored to your interests when you visit certain pages of this website, but we do not provide any PII to an advertiser when you interact with or view a customized advertisement. However, when you view or interact with an advertisement, the possibility exists that the advertiser will make the assumption that you are interested in the subject matter of the advertisements.

The following third parties offer information about their data collection practices, and in some cases, an opt-out, on their respective websites (click to visit their websites). Please visit each company's respective privacy policy to better understand the controls available to you. You can also learn more about ad serving companies and opt-out from each of them at the [Network Advertising Initiative website](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) or the [Digital Advertising Alliance website](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. If you use the Service, you will continue to receive generic advertisements.
