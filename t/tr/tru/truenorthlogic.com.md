    **TRUENORTHLOGIC**
    **PRIVACY POLICY**

**iAssessment Inc.** _aka_ **Truenorthlogic** (“we”) recognizes the importance of privacy to our website visitors and users of our online services (collectively, “you”).  In order to provide you with the best possible experience it may be necessary for us to collect and store certain information about you.  This Privacy Policy explains what types of information we may collect from you and how we use that information to operate our public website (“Public Website”) and subscription online services (“Subscription Services”) and provide products and services to you. 

We reserve the right to amend and update this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason, and you are responsible for reviewing this Privacy Policy from time to time to become aware of any changes.  Any revisions to this Privacy Policy shall be effective immediately upon posting. 

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our _Terms of Use_ which can be found here: <http://www.truenorthlogic.com/cp/Terms/>

**Children's Online Privacy Protection**

We do not permit children under the age of thirteen (13) to register for the Subscription Services directly.  

In the event we become aware that a child has contributed unsolicited personal information to the Public Website through online message boards, electronic feedback mechanisms or other means, Truenorthlogic will promptly delete such personal information from its systems.   

If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child has registered for the Subscription Services or otherwise supplied personal information to us without your consent, please let us know by sending an email to legal@truenorthlogic.com and we will take the appropriate action. 

**Information We Collect**

_Personally Identifiable Information –_ When you use our Subscription Services or our Public Website, personally identifiable information is submitted to us by you or your District on your behalf.  This information may include:  full name, date of birth and email address.

_Behavioral Information -_ When you use our Public Website and our Subscription Services, we may collect the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet; the IP address of the computer you are using; the browser and operating system you are using; the date and time you access the Public Website and our Subscription Services; the Internet address of the website (if any) from which you linked to the Public Website and our Subscription Services; the number of links you click and the pages you view within the Public Website and our Subscription Services; and the searches you conduct via the Public Website and our Subscription Services.  We use “cookies” to automatically gather some of this information. A cookie is a small text file that we send to your computer to collect information about your activities on the Public Website and our Subscription Services.  The cookie transmits this information back to the Public Website and our Subscription Services each time your browser requests a page, and the information is stored to help facilitate your use of the Public Website the next time you visit. 

_Advertising_ \- We do not display any third party advertisements on our Public Website or in our Subscription Services. 

**Use of Information**

We use personally identifiable information in our Subscription Services to provide virtual educational services to you and your District and to improve our services. 

We use personally identifiable information in our Public Website to inform you of our products and services.

We may monitor IP addresses and other behavioral information for security purposes, site administration, trend analysis, to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, and to otherwise improve our services in both the Public Website and in our Subscription Services. 

We typically do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a visitor’s session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us.

**How We Share Your Information**

We do not sell any information we collect from you, including personally identifiable information and behavioral information, to any third party.  We may share aggregate, numeric-level information with third parties for educational research purposes.  We have procedures in place to de-identify all personal information prior to disclosing it for research purposes, in accordance with the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act and other law. 

We may engage third party agents to perform certain functions necessary to provide our services to you.  These agents may have access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions.  However, these agents may not use your personally identifiable information for their own purposes, such as sending you marketing offers about their products or services. 

We may disclose to third parties aggregated, anonymous information regarding traffic analysis and other information regarding the sites.  This information will not include personally identifiable data about you. We use “Google Analytics” to improve our Public Website and Subscription Services. Google Analytics collects information about frequency of usage, page visits and related data.  Google Analytics collects only IP addresses not names or other identifying information of our visitors.  You can learn more about how Google Analytics operates by reviewing Google’s privacy policies, available at https://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html.  You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to the Public Website and Subscription Services by disabling cookies on your browser.

We may make an application programming interface (“API”) available to third party service providers for their use in providing services that complement our programs (such as online content supplementing our offerings).  Some standard program information, such as course information and enrollment dates may be disclosed to such third parties in connection with the API.  All third parties receiving personally identifiable information as part of their service are required to adhere to all applicable privacy laws and regulations.

Please be aware that in the event our company or any of its assets are ever sold, the information we have collected may be transferred to the new owner.  In addition, your personal information may be transferred to third parties without notice to you in order to comply with applicable law, law enforcement agencies, to protect our rights, or protect the rights of other users.

**Public Posts**

Truenorthlogic’s corporate Public Website may feature forums, message boards or other media which enable you to submit content.  Please remember that any information you disclose in these areas is public and you should exercise caution to avoid disclosing any personal or otherwise sensitive information. 

**Information Security**

We have employed administrative, technical, electronic and contractual security measures to protect the information described in this policy from intentional or unintentional use or disclosure.  Though we will take these steps to safeguard your information, we cannot eliminate all security and privacy risks inherent in Internet use.  You acknowledge awareness of and accept such risks, including the limitations of security and authentication measures and the chance that any information transferred via the Public Website or our Subscription Services may be susceptible to eavesdropping, hacking and other security hazards or misappropriation.  We will not be liable for damages of any kind associated with these security risks.

**Links to Other Websites**

The Public Website or our Subscription Services may contain links to other websites.  We cannot guarantee your privacy once you leave our sites and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any websites to which the sites may link.  We are not responsible for the content of external websites.  We encourage you to consult the privacy policy of any other website you visit.
