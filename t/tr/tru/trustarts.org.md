# Privacy Policy | The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust

## Trust Arts Privacy Policy

This site dedicated to the promotion of Pittsburgh Cultural Trust and Cultural District programs including activities produced and presented by resident companies: August Wilson Center, Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, Pittsburgh CLO, Pittsburgh Opera, Pittsburgh Public Theater, and Pittsburgh Symphony.

Your privacy is important to us. We want to help make your experience online satisfying and safe. Because we collect certain types of information about our users, we feel you should understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we collect and how we use it.

### INFORMATION THAT IS COLLECTED AND TRACKED 

We collect two types of information about users:

1\. Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions to receive electronic newsletters, to submit questions and comments, to share information with a friend, and participation in polls, surveys, and ticket purchases. 

2\. Information gathered through aggregated tracking information derived page views throughout our site. This information allows us to better tailor content to readers' interests and to determine traffic through our site. 

### HOW INFORMATION IS USED 

We offer the following free services, which involve our use of personal information that is voluntarily submitted by users:

1\. Electronic newsletters: We offer free electronic newsletters. TrustArts.org collects email addresses and additional optional information of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from email distribution by following the unsubscribe link provided in every email. 

2\. "Email a friend" and other social media services: Users can choose to forward site information to someone else. To do so, the user must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is used only in the case of transmission and to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose.

3\. Polling/Blogging: We may offer interactive polls and other feedback methods to users so they can easily share their opinions. Opinions and other responses are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user unless the user wishes to be associated with their submission.

4\. Surveys: TrustArts.org may conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We may share audience feedback and aggregated demographic information with our sponsors, future advertisers and partners. We do not share information about specific individuals with any third party.

In addition, we may use the information we collect from users to (a) provide other services that we may offer or that users may request, (b) assess and measure the use of our website and services, and (c) customize and improve this website and the services we provide.

### ANONYMITY

You may purchase tickets and remain anonymous if you choose to pay by cash in person at our Box Office.

### PROTECTING CHILDREN

Consistent with federal law, we will never knowingly request or collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.

### COOKIES

We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain personal information although it will enable us to relate your use of this website to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie cannot read data from your hard disk or read cookie files created by other websites. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. However, you may need cookies activated on your system to participate actively in forums, polling and surveys.

### LINKS

Our website may include links to other websites. We do not control the privacy policies of the destination websites. Once you leave our servers (you can check where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the website you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of those websites via a link from the website's homepage, you should contact the manager of that website for more information. TrustArts.org is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of websites other than our website.

### SECURITY

TrusArts.org operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our customers. Although we use security that we believe to be appropriate to protect your personal information, we do not guarantee that our security precautions will protect against, and we expressly disclaim any liability for, any loss, misuse, or alteration of your personal information.

### PROMOTIONAL POLICY

Occasionally, TrusArts.org  will provide special offers and promotions for non-profit and entertainment organizations to audience members and those that have signed up to receive cultural information. We do not release telephone numbers but may utilize phone blasting technology to inform audience members of vital customer service information such as program changes, weather cancellations, travel advisories, and other event-related news.

### YOUR CONSENT

By using this website, you consent to the collection and use of information by TrusArts.org and The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page.
