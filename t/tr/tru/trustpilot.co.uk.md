1.5  Your IP address, browser settings and location

When you visit the Website, we register your computer's IP address and browser settings. The IP address is the numerical address of the computer used to visit the Website. Browser settings can include the type of browser you use, browser language, and time zone.

Further, we use the IP address to approximate your location (at city level).

1.6  Newsletter sign-up information  

We collect the information you provide us with when you sign up to receive our newsletters, such as your name and email address. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletters, you can unsubscribe by logging in to your user profile and changing your personal settings.

We may also use the information in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection. We may use or disclose information that is not personal information for any purpose to the extent permitted by applicable law.

### 2  Disclosure of personal information

2.1  Disclosure of personal information on the Website

Your acceptance of this Policy also implies consent to disclose information about you on the Website. This includes your username, which may reveal your identity in full or in part - unless you have chosen to use a pseudonym.

We recommend that you exercise care in deciding which information to make available for disclosing on the Website, and be aware that depending on the level of information provided, you may or may not be anonymous.

Master Data

When you write a review on our Website and create a profile, your username will be visible to other users of the Website.

Other information

Other information provided by you on the Website, including photos and reviews, is automatically made visible on the Website. The companies you review may also receive information about your review.

Geo-location

When you make a contribution to the Website, we use your computer's IP address (see section 1.4 of this Policy) to approximate your location to the nearest city. This is made available to other users of the Website.

Social Networks

If you connect to a Social Network, information such as your profile photo, your name, birth year and approximate location will be collected from your Social Network profile and used to identify you on the Website. Subject to privacy settings and the level of information available from the Social Network, users of the Website may be able to use this information to identify which reviews you have written.

If you have chosen to preserve anonymity by using a pseudonym for your Trustpilot username, be aware that information from Social Network(s) may reveal your identity in part or in full and make it possible to identify which reviews you have written.

If your contacts or your contact's contacts (jointly referred to as "Connections") on the Social Network have also connected with Trustpilot, we may display on the Website how you are connected to these Connections through the Social Network.

2.2  Disclosure on services to which you connect your profile

If you choose to connect your Trustpilot profile with profiles on a Social Network, information and reviews provided by you on the Website or data compiled by us about your use of the service on the Website (e.g. the number of reviews you have written) will be shared with and displayed in connection with your profile on the Social Network and will be subject to the privacy policy of the Social Network.

2.3  Disclosure to other services and companies

One of Trustpilot's main goals is to increase the exposure and availability of reviews on the Website. We therefore permit other services to show reviews created on the Website. This increases the potential audience for your reviews.

The categories of third party services and companies to which the information is disclosed are:

  * Search engines, including Google and Bing.
  * Companies reviewed on Trustpilot.
  * Consumer portals and business portals, including price comparison websites, shopping guides etc.
  * Application partners and platforms, such as Magento, Shopify, WooCommerce.   
  * Other similar websites where, in Trustpilot's assessment, it will be relevant for users to search for reviews.



Once you submit your review, it is published on the Website. This means that the following information is disclosed:

  * Your review(s), (see section 1.2),
  * Your username and, if uploaded, a profile photo as well as user demographics such as gender, and
  * Your location (approximated to the closest city).



If you write a review on Trustpilot in response to an invitation sent by a company via Trustpilot's invitation services, the company who sent you the invite will be able to link your review with the invitation.  

If we need to verify your review, we may contact you and ask for documentation that shows that you have had a Service Experience with the company that you have reviewed. We therefore recommend that you keep such documentation for 12 months from the date of your review. We explain the type of documentation you should send us here: [support.trustpilot.com/hc/en-us/articles/201839083-What-does-Trustpilot-look-for-in-a-Proof-of-Purchase-](https://support.trustpilot.com/hc/en-us/articles/201839083-What-does-Trustpilot-look-for-in-a-Proof-of-Purchase-)

We do not share the documentation you send to us with the reviewed company. However, we may pass on your reference number to the company, unless you ask us not to.

2.4  Other disclosures

In addition to the above, we may disclose your personal information to the following parties and in the following circumstances:

  * To allow third party vendors, consultants and other service providers to perform services on our behalf.
  * To Trustpilot subsidiaries and other companies within the Trustpilot group of companies.
  * To comply with laws or to respond to claims, legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas and court orders) and requests from public and government authorities.
  * To cooperate with regulatory bodies and government authorities, including but not limited to Trading Standards, The Competition and Markets Authority, and the Danish Consumer Ombudsman, in connection with investigations or case referrals.  
  * To third parties in connection with enforcement of our Terms & Conditions.

  * To third parties in order for us to pursue available remedies, or limit damages that we may sustain.

### 3  Data controller

3.1  Information for which we are the data controller

We are the data controller of the Master Data you enter in connection with your creation of a profile, which includes but is not limited to your name, password and email address, as well as the registration of your IP address.

We are also the data controller of the information which is disclosed to other services (see section 2.3). Danish data protection laws govern collection of data by Trustpilot.

3.2  Information for which you are the data controller

You are the data controller for the content you choose to disclose on the Website, and for the data disclosed when you connect your Social Network profile(s) with your profile on the Website.

### 4  Links to websites

Our Website contains links to other websites. Our inclusion of such links does not imply our endorsement of those websites. We do not control the content of those third party websites, and assume no responsibility for the third party or their policies or practices.

We encourage you to review privacy policies for these third party websites because their procedures for collecting, handling and processing personal data may be different from ours.

### 5  Data processor and transfer of personal information outside the EU

We use external companies for maintaining the technical operation of the Website and our services. These companies are data processors for the personal data for which we are the data controller. By accepting this Policy, you agree that we may also allow the data for which you are the data controller to be processed by the same data processors.

The data processors must act solely in accordance with instructions from us. By accepting the Policy, you authorise us to give such instructions to the data processors to process data in accordance with the Policy and for the purpose of using the Website.

The data processors have taken reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect against the information being accidentally or illegally destroyed, lost or deteriorated, and to protect against the information being disclosed to unauthorised persons, being misused, or in other ways being processed in violation of the Danish Act on Processing of Personal Data (Persondataloven). On your request - and possibly in return for possible remuneration at the data processors' applicable hourly rates at any time for such work - the data processors must supply you with sufficient information to demonstrate that the above-mentioned technical and organisational safety measures have been taken.

Some of these data processors and third party services are located outside of the European Union, such as in the US. You consent to us using data processors in unsecure third countries provided that there is a legal framework governing the transfer of your personal data, for example if the company is part of the EU-US Privacy Shield framework.

### 6  Security measures

We seek to use reasonable organisational, technical and administrative measures to protect your personal information within our organisation and we regularly audit our system for vulnerabilities. However, since the internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of information you transmit to Trustpilot. Emails sent via the Website are not encrypted, and we therefore advise you not to include any confidential information in your emails to us.
