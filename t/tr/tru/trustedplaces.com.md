Welcome to trustedplaces, and congratulations for clicking on our Privacy Policy, you are probably one of the very few people who have decided to read them, and we thank you for that!

Trustedplaces has developed this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate its firm commitment to the privacy of your data. We’ve read 1984 by George Orwell and don’t like the idea of “big brother” so we strongly believe that your personal data should stay private. All our activities with reference to your data are governed by the Data Protection Act 1998. 

Trustedplaces is committed to safeguarding the privacy of your data whilst providing you with a personalised, fun, and valuable service. This Privacy Policy explains when and how personal information is collected, used, disclosed and protected with respect to trustedplaces.

**What is Personal Information?**  
Personal information is defined as information that specifically identifies an individual such as a username, name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, or other account number, and information about that individual's activities when directly linked to that person such as information about his or her use of trusteplaces. Personal information also includes demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies you. Essentially personal information is what makes you unique and special ;-)

Personal information does not include "aggregate" information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of places, products, services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users' needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor trustedplaces.
