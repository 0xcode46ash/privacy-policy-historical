**Trusteer Privacy Policy**

IMPORTANT: BY USING THE TRUSTEER SERVICES (AS DEFINED BELOW) YOU GIVE YOUR CONSENT THAT ALL PERSONAL DATA THAT YOU SUBMIT MAY BE PROCESSED BY TRUSTEER IN THE MANNER AND FOR THE PURPOSES DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING PRIVACY POLICY.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH HEREIN DO NOT USE TRUSTEER’S ON-LINE SERVICE, DOWNLOAD AND/OR INSTALL THE SOFTWARE AND PROMPTLY (within 3 days from the date you received this package) ERASE THE SOFTWARE AND ANY PART THEREOF, FROM YOUR COMPUTER AND DO NOT USE IT IN ANY MANNER WHATSOEVER.

At Trusteer Inc. and its affiliates (“Trusteer,” “our” or “we”), we recognize that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) applies to all of the software, services and products offered by Trusteer or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies (collectively, Trusteer's "Services"), and covers how personal and other information that Trusteer collects and receives, including information related to use of the Services, is treated.

If you have any questions about this Policy, please feel free to contact us at: [Support@Trusteer.com](mailto:Support@Trusteer.com) Information we collect and how we use it:

In order to provide our Services, we may collect the following types of information: 

  * Security related Information - When you use our Services, we automatically receive and record information from your computer and browser regarding possible security risks. This information is collected as part of our malicious activity detection processes and to continuously improve our ability to protect against evolving threats and malware. Collected information includes IP address, software and hardware attributes, and additional information related to security events such as URLs visited which the software and services deem potentially fraudulent and files identified as potentially related to malicious activity. Such files and URLs may contain personally identifiable information that a potentially fraudulent website or malware attempt to obtain without your permission. We do not deliberately collect personally identifiable information and we do not store or correlate any personally identifiable information with data from your computer. We do not track your browsing behavior.
  * Status information - When you use the Services, our software collects status information regarding installation and operation of the software, and information about attempts to modify, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, and terminate our Services. This information indicates to Trusteer whether installation of the software was successfully completed and whether the software has encountered an error. Prior to collecting such information, the software will attempt to eliminate all personally identifiable information if such information is included in the name of the file or folder encountered by the software at the time of installation or error. The status information is collected by Trusteer for the purpose of evaluating and improving Trusteer’s product performance and installation success rate and will not be correlated with any personally identifiable information.
  * User communications, Personal and Contact & information – In some situations, such as when you communicate with our contact center, we may ask for contact information. We process such information only for specific and limited purposes. We ask only for data that is adequate, relevant and not excessive for those purposes. When you send email or other communication to Trusteer, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our Services. 



When you use our products and services, we may send one or more cookies - a small file containing a string of characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. Trusteer may use Cookies information for activities such as automatically updating services on your system, monitoring aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages accessed, and personalizing the services we provide you. We do not use cookies to track your browsing behaviors.

Trusteer uses the information that you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services as well as to track user-generated content and users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If you use our Rapport product, you may choose to limit the information sent to us to critical security information only (such as malware infection indications) by configuring the software appropriately through the Rapport console, although this may result in reduced protection and limited functionality.

Trusteer will not share, sell, auction off or give away your personal information to any third-party or other organization other than as set forth herein.

Such information is secured such that it can be used only by the organization who manages your account and who prevents malicious activity on it, and cannot be used by anyone else including Trusteer to correlate the information with other personally identifiable information.
  * Trusteer uses all of the information that we collect to understand the usage trends and aggregate preferences of our users, to improve the Services, to create new features and functionality, and to continuously improve our ability to protect against evolving threats and malware. In order to promote awareness, detection and prevention of internet security risks, Trusteer may share certain anonymous information with research organizations and other security software vendors. Trusteer may also use statistics derived from the information to track and publish reports on security risk trends.
  * Trusteer may disclose the collected information if asked to do so by law enforcement officials, as required or permitted by law, in response to a subpoena or other legal process, or in litigation involving our company.
  * Trusteer may disclose the collected information to protect or defend our rights or property, or

  * We strive to maintain the reliability, accuracy, completeness and currency of data that we collect and to protect the privacy and security of our customers. We keep collected information only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or document retention requirements.
  * We limit access to contact information about you to employees, contractors and agents who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

We do not charge for complying with a correction request. Requests to delete personal information are subject to any applicable legal and ethical reporting or document retention obligations imposed on Trusteer.

We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required.
