_(4) Regarding Trupanion.com_

**

We also want to make you aware of how we use online data collecting devices known as "cookies." Many commercial Internet websites use "cookies." "Cookies" are files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences relating to our website. If you disable "cookies" on your browser, the website will not remember your preferences, and you will not be able to access a customized default home page view of our website. Our "cookies" are only used when you are visiting our website. While a code in the "cookie" file enables the website to label you as a particular user, "cookies" by themselves do not tell us your email address or other personally identifiable information. Only you can provide that information on our website — if you expressly choose to do so or if the preferences in your browser choose to do so automatically, in which case it may identify you by name, address, or other personal information.

"Cookies" help us understand your website usage so we can continually improve its usability. For example, if you have enabled this option, we may use "cookies" to personalize your experience on our website (e.g., to remember your customer ID on a login page). We may also use "cookies" to offer you other insurance and financial services products that may suit your needs. During the period you are logged into our website, we log Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (a number assigned to your computer when you use the Internet), browser and platform types, domain name, access times, referral data (the last website address or Uniform Resource Locator (URL) you visited before logging into our website and the first website address or URL you visit after leaving our website), and your activity while using our website.

While you may choose to disable cookies via your browser settings, doing so may not allow us to enhance your web user experience. Non-personally identifiable information may be collected, which may be used in Google Analytics features, such as demographics and interest reporting, remarketing, display network impression reporting, and DoubleClick campaign manager integration. Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for display advertising and customize Google display network ads by visiting Google Ads settings.

We use the SSL protocol, secure servers, and security protocol to safeguard the information you submit over the internet. It is important to note that email messages are not secure. Email messages traveling through the internet are subject to viewing, alteration, and copying by potentially anyone on the internet.

This website contains links to other websites. We provide links to other websites as a convenience to persons who visit our website. If you choose to use the services provided by those websites, you may be asked by those websites to provide certain personally identifiable information. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those websites, even if our name or logo appear on those websites. Please be aware that when you leave our website, we encourage you to read the privacy policies of each and every website that you visit, as the privacy policies of those websites may differ from ours. This privacy statement applies solely to this website.

We also work with a number of third-party internet advertising companies to serve behaviorally-targeted advertising to a variety of our website visitors. You may choose to opt out from participating in behavioral targeted advertising by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) opt out page: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>.

By opting out, you will stop receiving behavioral target ads from your visits to this website, but this does not mean you will be served any non-behavioral ads, nor does opting out stop information from being collected.
