## Information The TruGreen Companies collects and how it is used

The TruGreen Companies collects certain information to enable you to take full advantage of our offerings when you register at our site, order products or services, participate in our contests, surveys, promotions, or activities, or otherwise communicate with us. If you choose, you can visit The TruGreen Companies without providing us with any information about yourself. The TruGreen Companies collects both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information from users of its website.

### Personally Identifiable Information

When you register with The TruGreen Companies, we require you to give us contact information (such as your name, e-mail address, and physical address).

We may require additional information for specific promotions or contests run on our site. 

We use the customer contact information we collect to connect you with a service provider, and to send you, if you so choose, information about our company, newsletters, promotional materials, and information from the service provider network. 

We may also use the information we collect, in combination with outside records, to notify you about important changes to the website, new TruGreen Companies services and products, and special offers and information we think you’ll find valuable. We may send you information in conjunction with third-party partners that we think is relevant to your interests.

We use information gathered at the time of purchase to process your order, to enable the provider to fulfill your order, and to notify you of your order status. A customer care representative or service provider may contact you in order to fulfill a service you purchased or to provide information you requested. 

### Non-personally Identifiable Information

We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about you when you visit our site, such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, the referring site from which you came (e.g., a partner site), and the domain name of your internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink). 

We use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect in the aggregate to improve the design and content of our site. We also use this information to analyze site usage. 

## Disclosure of information to outside parties

To process your requests for products or services, we will need to share some of the personally identifiable information you provided (e.g., contact information and information about particular service needs) with service providers in the provider network.

If you choose to receive promotions, newsletters, and/or other types of correspondence from us, the correspondence that you receive will originate from The TruGreen Companies or the provider network, and your personally identifiable information will continue to be solely maintained by The TruGreen Companies.

If you registered with The TruGreen Companies through a third-party website or if you registered with a third-party website through The TruGreen Companies, we may need to report certain information to that website, as is necessary.

If you come to The TruGreen Companies via a co-branded partner and transact business with us, the information you provide may be collected and used by The TruGreen Companies, as well as by the co-branded partner from which you came. The TruGreen Companies is not responsible for the use that the co-branded partner makes with this information.

To help you identify when you are on The TruGreen Companies website, we place our logo in the upper left corner to indicate that you are within our website. 

The TruGreen Companies may be obligated to disclose personally identifiable information to law enforcement or agencies, even though such agencies may not comply with the terms of our privacy policy. The TruGreen Companies will disclose information to such agencies in response to legal process or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena, or a law enforcement agency’s request.

Finally, The TruGreen Companies may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, partners, service providers, or to the press. Aggregate statistics contain only non-personally identifiable information. 

## Information partners collect

Our site contains links to other websites whose information practices may be different than ours. You should consult the other sites’ privacy policies, as we have no control over information that you may submit or that the third parties collect on those sites.

We may offer promotions or content that is sponsored by, or co-branded with, identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, these third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that you submit. The TruGreen Companies has no control over the third party’s use of this information.
