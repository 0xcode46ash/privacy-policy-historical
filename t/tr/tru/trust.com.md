# Trust - Privacy statement

Trust takes your privacy very seriously. To ensure your privacy is protected we provide this notice explaining our practices in collecting and using your data.

**What This Privacy Policy Covers**  


  * This policy covers how Trust treats personal information that Trust collects and receives, including information related to your past use of Trust services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, e-mail address and that is not otherwise publicly available.
  * This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Trust does not own or control, or to people that Trust does not employ or manage.



**Information Collection and Use**  


  * Trust collects personal information (such as your name, e-mail address, gender and postcode) when you register with Trust, when you use Trust services and when you enter promotions or competitions.
  * Trust automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Trust cookie information, and the page you request.
  * Trust uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the content you see, fulfil your requests for services, improve our services, contact you (when permitted or required), conduct research, and provide internal reporting.



**Information Sharing and Disclosure**  


**Protection of personal data**
  * Any information you submit will never be sold or passed to third parties or used for any other purpose, unless explicitly mentioned on the pages where the information is retrieved.
  * Personal information is requested to tune information to the needs of the user and to contact users when required.
  * While appropriate security measures are in place to ensure the protection of your personal data, Trust cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this privacy policy. We have enlisted the appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorised access, maintain data security and correctly use the information we collect online.
  * Applicable only to the trustphotosite.com website: users are responsible for protecting their photo albums from public display, by setting the correct access mode (public, private, password protected).

**E-mail policy**
  * Trust uses opt-in with verification for user registration (e.g. at the Service Centre).
  * You will only receive e-mail from Trust mailing lists that you have subscribed to.
  * E-mail addresses supplied via the 'e-mail this page' item will not be stored in a database or used for any other purpose than for which it is intended.
  * After registration at the Service Centre you will receive a confirmation e-mail. If you do not perform the actions requested in this e-mail (because e.g. you did not request the account), the account will automatically be deactivated.
  * After completing registration, filling in a contact form or requesting information on the website, you may receive e-mail to confirm reception of your request. This in no way implies subscription to any mailing list whatsoever.

**Cookies**
  * Cookies are little pieces of information, stored by the website on your computer. There are two types of cookies: session cookies, which your browser automatically deletes after leaving the site, and permanent cookies, which are not automatically deleted (but you can do that yourself).
  * Session cookies are used to enable certain types of services on the site. Disabling cookies may cause (parts of) the site to not work correctly. Session cookies are required for the Service Centre.
  * Permanent cookies are used to store user settings, like your preferred language.
  * No personal data is stored in cookies, unless explicitly accepted by you.

**Activity log**
  * Website traffic is logged by Sitestat using a transparent 1x1 pixel GIF image on all web pages and also in webserver logfiles. This information is used to analyse usage of the site and will not (and cannot) be used to personally identify or track visitors.



**Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences**
