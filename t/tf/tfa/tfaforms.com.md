## What Information Do We Collect?

When you visit our Web site [www.formassembly.com](https://www.formassembly.com/) you may provide two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis and Web site use information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our Web site. 

### 1\. Personal Information You Choose to Provide

If you choose to subscribe to our services, we collect personal information such as: Name, Email Address, Mailing Address and Credit Card Information.

When a User completes a form created, or purchased, by one of our Subscribers, the User may choose to provide the Subscriber with personal information, such as:

E-mail address  
Social security number  
Health related information

Other personal information (i.e., mother's maiden name)  
E-mail Information  


We ask that Subscribers who create forms on our Site do not use the forms to collect credit card information. However, WE ARE NOT ABLE TO MONITOR OR RESTRICT ALL OF THE INFORMATION REQUESTED BY OUR SUBSCRIBERS. FURTHER, DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO PROTECT INFORMATION, WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT ALL INFORMATION THAT IS PROVIDED WILL REMAIN SECURE. See the section titled ‘How Can Your Information be Secured?’ below for further information.

In addition to providing the foregoing information to our Subscribers, if you choose to correspond further through e-mail, we may retain the content of your e-mail messages together with your e-mail address and our responses. We provide the same protections for these electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of information received by mail and telephone.

This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

## How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?

Broadly speaking, we may use personal information for purposes of administering our business activities and for providing Subscriber service. We are a Web site host and our primary function as it relates to User data is to facilitate use of the forms and to store such User inputted data for use by the Subscriber for their business purposes. We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities, such as offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. WE DO NOT SELL OR SHARE ANY COLLECTED INFORMATION WITH ANY THIRD PARTY OTHER THAN THE SUBSCRIBER TO WHOM YOU CHOOSE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR HOW THE SUBSCRIBER USES THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY USERS.

Our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-service.php) prohibit all Subscribers from engaging in spam activity. Violations of this policy may result in immediate termination of service and legal action.

### Choice/Opt-Out

We enable you to create an account, and share information such as messages, offers, & requests with others.

**Service-related Announcements**  
We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. These emails are service related and not marketing/promotional in nature therefore you might not be able to opt-out. 

**Surveys or Contests**  
From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). 

We use this information to gather feedback on new or improved features, determine what improvements should be made to the application, and improve personalization of the application. In the case of a contest, information is used to notify winners and award prizes.

## Tracking Technologies

Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Veer West LLC and our partners, affiliates, and analytics and customer support providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

We use cookies to remember users' settings (e.g., language preference) and for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.

### 3rd Party LS/LSO (Local Storage Objects)

Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our marketing site use LSOs such as HTML5 and Flash to collect and store information. Our product does not use third party LSOs. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. To manage Flash LSOs please [click here](https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html).

### Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting

We partner with a third party to manage our advertising of our service on other sites. We use retargeting to advertise our product.

* * *

  


## How Can Your Information be Secured?

We provide the capability for your data to be encrypted. However, the creator of the form in which you input data chooses how and whether to encrypt your information. Before inputting any sensitive information, determine if encryption is enabled by looking for the "lock" symbol on your web browser or a yellow highlight in the web browser address bar. 

INFORMATION OR E-MAIL THAT YOU SEND TO US MAY NOT BE SECURE UNLESS WE ADVISE YOU THAT SECURITY MEASURES WILL BE IN PLACE PRIOR TO YOUR TRANSMITTING THE INFORMATION. For that reason, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as a social security number to us through an unsecured e-mail. 

* * *

  


## Information Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). 

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at contact@formassembly.com. We do not, however, secure your personal information that is in the possession or control of our Subscriber. 

* * *

  


## How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may request access to all your personally identifiable information to correct, update, amend, delete/remove or deactivate it by making the change by logging into your account, by emailing us at contact@formassembly.com, or by contacting us by postal mail at the contact information listed below.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. 

* * *

  


## What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?

We may disclose your personal information:

  * as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process,
  * when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request,
  * if Veer West LLC is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information,
  * to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.



* * *

Integration with 3rd party services (Google Apps, Salesforce and more) requires exchange of information, such as credentials (username, password, open ID/single-sign-on tokens) and any other data required for implementation of said integration.
