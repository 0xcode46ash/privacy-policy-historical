**KIDS AND INTERNET SAFETY**

We at Things From Another World, Inc. understand that the Internet presents an opportunity for us to reach the public in new and exciting ways with information about our programming, fun games, exciting sweepstakes and contests, e-mail, chat rooms, bulletin boards, and other forms of interactivity. Things From Another World, Inc. also recognizes the privacy concerns of parents, and the importance of protecting the privacy of the information this Site collects from kids. Parents of kids who visit this Site can be confident that any personal information that may be provided to this Site will be collected and maintained in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). Things From Another World, Inc. encourages parents to supervise their kids' activities online and to participate in their kids' online activities whenever possible. However, we understand that parents may not always be able to supervise their kids' activities on the Internet. That's why Things From Another World, Inc. has developed a Site that parents can feel is safe for their kids and kids will find cool, informative, educational, and fun! Because there's always room for improvement, Things From Another World, Inc. welcomes any suggestions on how to make the Site a better, safer place to hang out. 

Section I of this Privacy Policy applies to the collection of personal information from all visitors to this site, regardless of age. Section II describes the special, additional policies Things From Another World, Inc. applies to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information submitted to this Site by kids under 13. 

**COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN UNDER 13**

When a visitor to our Site is under the age of 13, Things From Another World, Inc. does not require the disclosure of more personally identifiable information than is reasonably necessary for him or her to participate in an activity as a condition of such participation. 

Things From Another World, Inc. may use different types of personally identifiable information submitted to this Site by kids under 13 in a variety of ways, which are described below. In each instance, we comply with the parental consent requirements of COPPA. 

**A. Use of a Child's Information by Things From Another World, Inc.**

  * We may collect a child's e-mail address in connection with a contest, sweepstakes or game for the sole purpose of communicating with the child on a one-time-only basis (i.e., to contact a contest winner). This information will not be used to re-contact the child, and will be deleted from our records when the contest or game is over. Parental consent is obtained before we send the winner a prize. 
  * We may collect a child's e-mail address in order to respond more than once to a child's specific request. For example, the child may want to subscribe to an online newsletter or receive other online communications from Things From Another World, Inc. In these instances, Things From Another World, Inc. will also obtain a parent's e-mail address along with the child's. Before any further contact with the child, Things From Another World, Inc. will send an e-mail to the parent (a) notifying him or her we have collected the child's e-mail address in order to respond more than once to the child's request for a subscription, information, etc; (b) informing the parent that he or she can refuse us permission to contact the child, and how to do so; and (c) informing the parent that if he or she does not respond to the e-mail within 72 hours, Things From Another World, Inc. may use the child's information for the purpose for which it was submitted. 
  * We may collect a child's personally identifiable information (including name, e-mail address, mailing address, and phone number) for such activities as joining the Dark Horse Message Boards, chats, forums, surveys, games, bulletin boards, requests for suggestions, subscription registrations, content submissions, requests for products or services, or requests for additional information. In these instances, we will initially collect only the child's name and online contact information and the e-mail address of the child's parent. Before using this information for any purpose, we will send the parent an e-mail that (a) informs the parent that we wish to collect and use the child's personal information and need the parent's consent to do so, and (b) provides the parent with a link to access to this Privacy Policy, which describes our information collection and use policies as required by COPPA. If the proposed use of the child's personal information does not involve disclosure to a third party, then Things From Another World, Inc. will ask the parent to provide consent by return e-mail. Upon receipt of the e-mail consent, we will send the parent a confirming e-mail. If the proposed use of the child's personal information involves disclosure to third parties, the e-mail we send to the parent will ask the parent either to (i) return by postal mail or fax a consent form that will be attached to the e-mail, or (ii) call a toll-free number where consent can be given over the phone. If parental consent is not obtained by one of these methods within 72 hours, Things From Another World, Inc. will delete all of the child's and parent's personally identifiable information from its records. In addition, parents can revoke a prior consent at any time. 
  * We may collect a child's name and e-mail address to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the security of this Site, to protect against liability, or as required or permitted by law. Information collected for these reasons will not be used for any other purpose. 



**B. Sharing Children's Personal Information with Third Parties.**

Things From Another World, Inc. may share a child's personal information with our affiliated companies and promotional partners for their marketing purposes. These third parties have not agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from Things From Another World, Inc.. As noted above, parents may exercise their option not to consent to the disclosure of their child's personal information to third parties. Parents may consent to Things From Another World, Inc.'s collection and use of a child's personal information without consenting to the disclosure of the information to third parties. 

**LINKS/CO-BRANDED SITES**

As noted in Section I of this Privacy Policy, this Site may link directly to sites operated by Things From Another World, Inc.'s advertisers, business partners, and affiliated companies. Those sites, which are not controlled by Things From Another World, Inc., may collect personal information from your child. Parents should therefore check the relevant site's privacy policy to understand how it collects and uses kids' personal information. Things From Another World, Inc. will not share in any personal information obtained by a site from a child under the age of 13 unless that site follows the requirements of COPPA. 

**REVIEWING AND MAKING CHANGES TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM CHILDREN UNDER 13**

Parents of children under age 13 may review, change, or delete personal information about their kids from our records at any time. If you would like to review, change, or delete your child's personal information, please [contact us](http://www.tfaw.com/Help/Getting-Help). If you have requested deletion of your child's information, we will immediately delete your child's information from our database and refrain from collecting any other personally identifiable information from your child.
