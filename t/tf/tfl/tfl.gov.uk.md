Transport for London (TfL) is a functional body of the Greater London Authority, reporting to the Mayor of London.

TfL is responsible for managing, providing and procuring a range of transport services and facilities on behalf of the Mayor. This is achieved through a number of wholly owned subsidiary companies and modes which include:

  * London Buses 
  * Docklands Light Railway 
  * Dial-a-Ride 
  * London Trams 
  * Victoria Coach Station 
  * London River Services 
  * London’s Transport Museum 
  * London Underground 
  * Public Carriage Office 
  * CrossRail 
  * Street Management 



TfL considers its obligations under the Data Protection Act and related legislation to be of paramount importance, and has taken steps to ensure compliance with those provisions.  
This privacy policy explains what information TfL and its subsidiaries collect about those customers that use its websites and the procedures we have in place to safeguard your privacy.

## What personal information do we collect?

The information we request from you will depend on the type of service you request or register for. It may simply be an e-mail address if you post a message to our bulletin board or it may include details such as Vehicle Registration Numbers if you are registering for Congestion Charging or credit card details if you purchase a ticket on-line.

In any case, we will only request information that is necessary to enable us to provide you with the service you have requested.

We may occasionally collect what is known as sensitive personal data under the Data Protection Act. This may happen where you are a Blue Badge holder and apply for a congestion charging discount or are claiming a fare refund owing to ill health. When we collect this type of data we are required to go to greater lengths to look after it and keep its use to a minimum. We will always aim to get your agreement to our using your sensitive personal data for those limited purposes.

If you are under 18, please get your parent/guardian's permission before providing personal information to TfL.

These purposes are notified to the Information Commissioner who regulates the Data Protection Act and you can see the current notification for TfL and its subsidiaries at www.informationcommissioner.gov.uk 

The principle purposes for which we collect and store your information are:

  * Travel ticket administration (including fare enforcement and prosecutions) 
  * Congestion charging 
  * Bus lane enforcement 
  * Research

  * Taxi and private hire vehicle licensing
