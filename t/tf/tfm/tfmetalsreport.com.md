# Privacy Policy | TF Metals Report

**This is the web site of TFMETALSREPORT.COM. In visiting our site, the user can have the following expectations in terms of privacy.**

**E-mail Addresses**  
We collect and store in our database the e-mail addresses of those who choose to communicate with us via e-mail.

**Use of Collected Information**  
We collect aggregate information on what pages our users access, utilize and depart. We also collect information volunteered by users such as information provided in online surveys and feedback forms. Information we collect may be used to notify users about updates to our web site. TFMetalsReport.com does not sell to or trade e-mail lists with third parties.

**Other Web Sites and Links**  
TFMetalsReport.com contains links to other informative web sites. If you choose to use any of these links, you will be leaving the TFMetalsReport.com site. Protection of your privacy at these linked sites will be governed by the privacy policy of that site. TFMetalsReport.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of such sites or the use of any information that you provide while there.

**Cookies**  
TFMetalsReport.com utilizes website activity tracking that allows us to monitor user activity on our site. Tracking software does not capture personal information other than activity through your user profile such as comments posted, and it allows us to record which pages of our site are viewed most often. Having this information allows us to manage our site more effectively. When you visit our site, we may place a "cookie" on your computer to allow us to record your session summary and provide access to information that requires online registration.

**Private Messages**  
Moderators do not supervise or moderate the private messaging system, and therefore cannot assume any responsibility for its use or content. However, in the event of the private message system being used to spam, abuse, or harass other members of the site, the moderators may request to see copies of the offending messages. Members may also forward contents of your messages to others due to their own volition, regardless as to the "ethics" of such an action. Therefore, do not assume the contents of your private messages are fully "private," other than that they are not allowed to be posted publicly on the website or elsewhere. (Members who do post content of private messages in public forums without permission will be properly reprimanded by moderators and the private messages removed from public view.)  TF Metals Report offers the ability to allow you to block messages from offensive or undesired senders, and encourages you to do so as a first resort, and not involve moderators unless absolutely necessary. 

**Acceptance of this Privacy Policy**  
By using this site, you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of this TFMetalsReport.com Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, please do not use this site. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the site after these changes are posted constitutes your agreement to any changes with regard to information collected. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us.
