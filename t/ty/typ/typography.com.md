We reserve the right to modify and update the Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post notice of any such modifications on the Website. You can review our most recent Privacy Policy.

**Personal Information Collected.** If you register with us, we will collect your first and last name and your email address. If you choose to purchase H&Co Products or services, we will also collect your credit card number and billing address.

**Computer Information Collected.** Additionally, H&Co automatically collects certain non-personal computer or device-related information from visitors to the Website (and, if you are a subscriber to the Cloud.typography service, visitors to your website), including the operating system (e.g. Mac OS X, iOS, Windows 8, Android), the visitor’s IP address, and the web browser (e.g. Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer) (collectively “Computer Information”).

**Use of Information.** H&Co uses the personal information collected to respond to user requests for products, services and information, to customize the site in accordance with user preferences, to contact users pursuant to their requests and to send transactional messages pursuant to a given user’s purchases and subscriptions (including invoices). H&F uses the Computer Information it collects to analyze and improve the Website and the products and services offered therein, and to provide the Cloud.typography service.

H&Co will not feature third party advertisements of any kind on the Website, and will not send marketing communications on behalf of third parties.

**“Cookies.”** “Cookies” (which may be HTML files, Flash files, or other technology) are text files that help store user preferences and activity. H&Co may place cookies on your computer or other device when you visit the Website. These cookies contain information about your user preferences and your experience with this Website necessary for the propagation of content and the navigation of this Website and its storefront. H&Co uses cookies to help tailor and customize the website for its users, to allow users to leave and return without logging in every time, and to enable users to use shopping carts and other e-commerce features. The use of cookies is an industry standard; many websites use them. If you do not wish to receive cookies, or want to be notified when they are placed, you may set your web browser to do so if your browser so permits. Please note that many sections of the Website require cookies to function properly; disabling them may limit the functioning of the Website for you.

**Disclosure of Information.** H&Co may store and disclose personal information as allowed or required by applicable law, including making disclosures that are necessary or advisable to (a) protect the rights, safety, or property of H&Co or others and (b) comply with legal processes or regulatory requirements. We may also transfer your information to any affiliated business, and in the event of a merger or acquisition or asset sale, your information may be disclosed to the acquiring entity. Without your express approval, however, H&Co will not sell or rent or otherwise commercially exploit your personal information, although we may collect and/or provide aggregate statistics about our Website, products, services, and users to other parties.

**Disclosure of Information to Service Providers.** H&Co uses several third party providers, listed below, to provide the Website and the Cloud.typography service. H&Co may disclose information to these service providers in order to provide our Website and services to you.
