# Type & Grids — Privacy policy

#### Type & Grids privacy policy

_Type & Grids is owned and operated by [Jeremiah Shoaf Design LLC](http://www.jeremiahshoaf.com/)._

#### Our commitment to privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. By using the site, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy.

_Note: the privacy practices set forth in this privacy policy are for this website only. If you follow links to other websites, please review the privacy policies posted at those sites._

#### The information we collect

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Type & Grids website. On our “Sign up for email updates” page you can submit your email address to sign up for product updates. The types of personal information collected in this form are the following:

Email address

When you purchase a product through Type & Grids we collect your email address. Type & Grids uses a third party shopping cart system called [E-junkie](http://www.e-junkie.com/) to handle orders and deliver digital goods. You can view [E-junkie's privacy policy here](http://www.e-junkie.com/ej/privacy.htm). For payment, [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/) or [Google Checkout](https://checkout.google.com/) is used and implemented through E-junkie. You can view the [PayPal privacy policy here](https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/marketingweb?cmd=p/gen/ua/policy_privacy-outside) and the [Google Checkout privacy policy here](https://checkout.google.com/files/privacy.html). Type & Grids does not have access to any of your credit card or debit card info. If you provide your mailing address to PayPal or Google Checkout we do have access to that information.

#### The way we use information

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. We do not use your mailing address for any purpose or share it with any outside parties.

We may very occasionally use the email address you supply through E-junkie, PayPal or Google Checkout to notify you of product updates or new releases.

You can register your email address with our website email sign up form if you would like to receive news and updates on our products. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. Instructions for unsubscribing will be included with every email.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

#### Our commitment to data security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

#### Privacy policy changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Type & Grids may change its privacy policy from time to time, and in Type & Grids’ sole discretion. Type & Grids encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its privacy policy.
