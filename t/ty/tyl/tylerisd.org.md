# Web Privacy Statement

                               Web Privacy Statement
At Tyler Independent School District, we strive to respect the privacy of our Web site visitors
because your privacy is important to us. Using the Internet should be a pleasant experience,
and we want to help you make it enjoyable. This privacy statement describes what
information we collect and how that information is protected and used with those ideas in
mind.
Information Gathered
Web sites you visit may gather information about you. Sometimes you are asked to supply
information such as your name, address or e-mail address. Other times processes built into
the Web site gather information.
We may ask you for information to answer a request that you have submitted to Tyler ISD.
An example would be your name and address for mailing a public information request.
Information sent to Tyler ISD via Web data entry may be read, filed, stored, forwarded,
responded to or printed by Tyler ISD staff members for the purpose of answering and
tracking your request. In some cases, the district may outsource the collection of information
and your information may be read, filed, stored, forwarded, responded to or printed by
employees of a third-party vendor providing services under contract with the district.
You may be asked to enter your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or other
information on an Tyler ISD Web site. This information may be kept and used for future
communications.
The district may release your personal information to third parties under provisions of Tyler
ISD's Administrative Policies and Procedures. The Federal Educational Rights and
Privacy Act governs student data and information, and usage of Web site information must
comply with this law.
Collection of Other Information
Most information we gather does not identify you personally. We automatically collect
information such as the type and identity of the Internet service provider you are using, your
Internet protocol (IP) address, the time spent on the Web site, or the navigation path you took
on the Web site. We use the gathered information to improve the navigation, flow and
content of the Web site to provide you with the best possible information service.


Special Disclosure Cases
Requests for public information (formally known as open records requests) are handled in
accordance with the Texas Public Information Act, Texas Government Code ยง 552.01 (et
seq). All requests for public information should be submitted to the Records Management
Office. Governmental bodies shall promptly release requested information that is not
confidential by law or information for which an exception to disclosure has been sought.
Tyler ISD may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe
that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against
someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or
unintentionally) Tyler ISD's rights or property, other Tyler ISD users, or anyone else that
could be harmed by such activities. We reserve the right to use information to identify any
visitors who refuse to comply with the Tyler ISD Acceptable Use Agreement for
Technology Resources and to identify visitors who threaten our service, site, customers or
others. The district may disclose information when we believe in good faith that the law
requires it.
E-Commerce Transactions
Some of our Web site features may use applications to collect data to facilitate an e-
commerce transaction. We may use an outside service with an approved banking relationship
to process credit card transactions. All credit card information is encrypted and only the
information needed to complete a transaction history is stored on our secure server.
Public Forums, Directories, Chat Rooms and Mail Lists
This privacy statement does not protect you when you use any Tyler ISD public forums. As a
service to our users, Tyler ISD may offer directories, chat rooms, bulletin or message boards,
or mailing list groups for our Web site visitors. Any information shared in a directory, chat
room, bulletin board, or other posting or online discussion is public information and may be
seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties that do not adhere to this privacy statement.
Other Links
The Tyler ISD Web site may contain destination links to other independently run Web sites
for Tyler ISD student groups or organizations and to some third-party sites outside the
"tylerisd.org" domain. Tyler ISD is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of
such Web sites. These destination links are provided only for your convenience, and as such,
you access them at your own risk. Any information you reveal on any such site is not subject
to this privacy statement, therefore, you should consult the privacy policies of each site you
visit. However, we wish to ensure the integrity of our Web site and its destination links, so
any comments pertaining to any sites accessed through destination links on our Web site are
greatly appreciated.


Security
Tyler ISD treats your personal information as an asset that must be protected against loss and
unauthorized access. This Web site has information security measures in place to protect the
loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We restrict access to our
data center and server rooms to authorized personnel and limit access to personal information
to those employees who have a legitimate business need to access such information. Despite
these security measures, we do not represent or warrant that personal information will be
protected against loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties.
Privacy Policy Changes
We may change this privacy statement at any time by posting revisions to our Web site. Your
use of the Web site constitutes acceptance of the provisions of this privacy statement and
your continued usage after such changes are posted constitutes acceptance of each revised
privacy statement. If you do not agree to the terms of this privacy statement or any revised
statement, then please exit the Web site immediately.
Reporting Personal Privacy Issues
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, your personal information, the
practices of this Web site or your interaction with this Web site, please email the webmaster.
