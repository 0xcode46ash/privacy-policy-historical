**Advertisers**: 

TVU Networks allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the TVU Networks Platform. These third-party ad servers or ad networks may use technology to send, directly to your browser, TVUPlayer, or TVU Broadcasting Application, the advertisements that appear on the TVU Networks Platform and they may automatically receive your IP Address and other log file information when this happens.  Such third-party ad servers or ad networks may also use other technologies (such as cookies, javascript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize their advertising content. 

TVU Networks  does not provide your personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent.  However, please note that if an advertiser asks TVU Networks to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, males aged 24) or audience segment (for example, males aged 24 who have  viewed certain types of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience that they were trying to reach.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks.  This Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.  TVU Networks reserves the right to add or remove third-party ad networks or ad servers in its discretion and TVU Networks may not at all times list such updated ad network or ad server partners in this Privacy Notice.
