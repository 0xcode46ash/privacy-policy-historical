**COOKIES & WEBSITE TRAFFIC MEASURING   
** 9. TVNZ currently uses Nielsen//NetRatings and Omniture website measurement software and systems to help measure traffic visiting our websites. The service anonymously aggregates site visit statistics, such as number of pages viewed time spent on site, and Nielsen//NetRatings also randomly asks visitors to complete anonymous short site surveys. Nielsen//NetRatings has been adopted as an accepted audience measurement standard by major New Zealand publishers and corporate websites. Nielsen//NetRatings is responsible for aggregating all information; individuals cannot and will not be identified. The information is used by TVNZ to better understand usage of its websites. Limited data is also made available to advertising and media organisations. 

10. Each web page has a small piece of Nielsen//NetRatings and Omniture code that will not be visible as you look at any particular page. The software stores a cookie in your browser (if you have enabled cookies) which contains a unique identifier to allow us to track the number of unique visitors to our website. This information is collected and aggregated by Nielsen//NetRatings and Omniture and in no way can you be identified personally and no personal information is stored about you. 

11. Some advertisements on our site are provided by other organisations. Our advertising partners may serve ads that they believe are most likely to be of interest to you, based on information about your visit to this and other websites (this information is anonymous in that it does not include your name, street address, email address or telephone number). In order to do this, our advertising partners may need to place a cookie on your computer.

LINKS TO EXTERNAL SITES **   
12. Please note that the Site may contain links to and from websites not controlled by TVNZ.  If you follow a link to any other website, those websites will have their own privacy policies and we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies.
