# Official TV Licensing website - TV Licensing privacy and security policies

'TV Licensing' is a trade mark of the BBC and is used under licence by companies contracted by the BBC to administer the collection of the television licence fee and enforcement of the television licensing system. We (the BBC) are a public authority in respect of our television licensing functions and we retain overall responsibility. We are also the data controller of personal data processed by TV Licensing.

We are committed to safeguarding personal information that you provide to us. This commitment extends to our TV Licensing contractors and subcontractors. Whenever you or someone acting on your behalf provide us with your personal information, we are legally obliged to use it in line with all laws concerning the protection of such information, including the Data Protection Act 1998 (these laws are referred to collectively in this Privacy Policy as the "data protection laws"). The BBC is the data controller under the Data Protection Act 1998 in respect of our TV Licensing functions.

__Most websites you visit will use cookies in order to improve your user experience by enabling that website to ‘remember’ you, either for the duration of your visit (using a ‘session cookie’) or for repeat visits (using a ‘persistent cookie’).__

__Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, storing your preferences, and generally improving your experience of a website. Cookies make the interaction between you and the website faster and easier. Some are used to assess and improve the performance of a website based on how people are using it. Others are necessary to ensure you can transact or log in, for instance. If a website doesn’t use cookies, it will think you are a new visitor every time you move to a new page on the site – for example, when you enter your login details and move to another page it won’t recognise you and it won’t be able to keep you logged in.__

__Some websites will also use cookies to enable them to target their advertising or marketing messages based for example, on your location and/or browsing habits.__

__Cookies may be set by the website you are visiting (‘first party cookies’) or they may be set by other websites who run content on the page you are viewing (‘third party cookies’). You can learn more about the[different types of cookies in Section 4.5](https://web.archive.org/web/20151121132500id_/http%3A//www.tvlicensing.co.uk/privacy-security-policies#4.5).__

####  __4.1. What is in a cookie?__

__A cookie is a simple text file that is stored on your computer or mobile device by a website’s server and only that server will be able to retrieve or read the contents of that cookie. Each website can send its own cookie to your device. Each cookie is unique to your web browser and will contain some anonymous information such as a unique cookie id, the site you are browsing and a uniquely generated number that allows a website to remember your preferences or what’s in your shopping basket, for example.__

####  __4.2. Can I browse the TV Licensing website without receiving any cookies?__

__Depending on the web-browser that you use to access our website, you may have the ability to accept or decline cookies locally within your browser. Options include accepting all cookies automatically, notifying you when a cookie is downloaded, or not receiving cookies at any time. These options may be found in the ‘preferences’ section of your web browser. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. You may find the[www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/) website useful for information on how to change cookie settings in a range of commonly used browsers. If you set your computer to reject cookies, you can still browse www.tvlicensing.co.uk. However, certain functions will not be available to you including paying for your TV Licence and updating your details.__

####  __4.5. Types of cookies__

#####  __4.5.1. First Party Cookies__

__First party cookies are set by the website, or domain, you are visiting (e.g. www.tvlicensing.co.uk) and only that website can retrieve the information stored in those cookies. You can tell if a cookie is a first party cookie if the host domain for a cookie is the same as the one in the browser.[Find out how to view cookies in your browser](https://web.archive.org/web/20151121132500id_/http%3A//www.tvlicensing.co.uk/privacy-security-policies#4.8).__

#####  __4.5.2. Third Party Cookies__

__Third party cookies are set by an organisation other than TV Licensing. For example, TV Licensing uses a number of suppliers who set cookies on TV Licensing’s behalf in order to deliver the services that they are providing (e.g. reporting on visit volumes to a particular webpage). These will be third party cookies.__

#####  __4.5.2.1 How do third party organisations which display TV Licensing online communications use cookies?__

__We use a range of channels (including television, radio and online) in order to raise awareness, explain the law relating to TV Licensing, provide information about ways to pay and deter evaders.__

__Where online communications are used (for example, banners displayed on other websites by third parties acting on behalf of TV Licensing), a cookie will be sent to your browser from the other website and stored on your computer. These cookies are used for analytical purposes in order to monitor the interaction between, and effectiveness of, our online communications, letters and emails.   We will ensure that cookies set by third parties on behalf of TV Licensing comply with the TV Licensing Privacy Policy and we will not collect personal data during this process. [Find out more in section 4.6 How does TV Licensing use cookies?](https://web.archive.org/web/20151121132500id_/http%3A//www.tvlicensing.co.uk/privacy-security-policies#4.6)__

__It is the responsibility of third party websites themselves to provide information about non-TV Licensing cookies that may be served from their site. We therefore recommend that you check the cookies policy of any external sites if you would like to know more about their use of cookies. If the host domain for a cookie is different to the one in the browser bar when it was downloaded, then it is a third party cookie.__

#####  __4.5.3. Session Cookies__

__Session Cookies are stored only temporarily during a browsing session and are deleted from your device when the browser is closed.__

#####  __4.5.4. Persistent Cookies__

__This type of cookie is saved on your computer for a fixed period (usually a year or longer) and is not deleted when the browser is closed. Persistent cookies are used where we need to identify your computer or device for more than one browsing session. For example, we use this type of cookie to count the number and frequency of repeat visits to the TV Licensing website.__

__Persistent cookies can also be used if we need to know who you are so that we can store your preferences and remember them for the next visit. TV Licensing does not currently use persistent cookies in this way.__

#####  __4.5.5. Web beacons, clear GIFs, page tags and web bugs__

__These are all terms used to describe a particular form of technology implemented by many sites in order to help them to understand and analyse how their site is being used and, in turn, to improve your experience of the site.__

__A web beacon usually takes the form of a small, transparent image, which is embedded in a web page or an email. They are used in conjunction with cookies and send information such as your IP address, when the page or email was viewed, from what device and which geographic location.__

__TV Licensing uses web beacons in emails to tell us if the email has been opened.__

#####  __4.5.6. Opting out of web beacons__

__As a web beacon forms part of a web page, it is not possible to ‘opt-out’ as such but you can render some of them ineffective by not downloading images in your email.__

__[How can I view and control different types of cookies?](https://web.archive.org/web/20151121132500id_/http%3A//www.tvlicensing.co.uk/privacy-security-policies#4.8)__

####  __4.6. How does TV Licensing use cookies?__

#####  __4.6.1.__

__Cookies enable us to identify your device and track its unique interaction with the TV Licensing website; we don’t use cookies to communicate with you as an individual or to create a personal profile of you. We use cookies that are **strictly necessary** to enable you to move around the site or to provide certain features you have requested, for instance to pay for your TV Licence or update your details. We also use cookies to help us to measure and improve the **performance** of our website to provide you with a better user experience and measure the effectiveness of our online communications, letters and emails.__

__The[next section (4.7)](https://web.archive.org/web/20151121132500id_/http%3A//www.tvlicensing.co.uk/privacy-security-policies#4.7) explains these categories of cookie and provides a list of the cookies set by the TV Licensing website along with an explanation of what each of those cookies is used for.__

__The information collected by cookies will be used in the same way as other information that we collect about you – provided in[section 5](https://web.archive.org/web/20151121132500id_/http%3A//www.tvlicensing.co.uk/privacy-security-policies#5).__

#####  __4.6.2.__

We also use data collected by cookies for analytical purposes in order to monitor the interaction between, and effectiveness of, our online communications, letters and emails. These cookies allow us to analyse which pages customers have visited on our site and whether customers have reached the website via our promotional banners on third party sites.

  2. __**Receiving your TV Licence renewal reminders and other important information by email** __
    1. __If you purchased your licence via the TV Licensing website at www.tvlicensing.co.uk you are required to provide a valid email address.

__There are a number of ways in which you can stop (i.e. unsubscribe from) receiving emails and/or text messages from TV Licensing (refer to[5.5.1](https://web.archive.org/web/20151121132500id_/http%3A//www.tvlicensing.co.uk/privacy-security-policies#5.5.1)-[5.5.3](https://web.archive.org/web/20151121132500id_/http%3A//www.tvlicensing.co.uk/privacy-security-policies#5.5.3).).

__You can[unsubscribe from receiving emails from TV Licensing by updating your details via the website](https://web.archive.org/cs/update/your-licence/index.app) and following the instructions.__

#####  __5.5.3. Unsubscribe via the instructions contained in the emails / texts themselves.__

####  __9.1. Links to other websites__

__The TV Licensing website may contain links and references to other websites. Please be aware that this Privacy Policy does not apply to those websites and we encourage you to read the Privacy Policy of the other websites you visit.__

####  __9.2. Internet Protocol Addresses__

We log the IP address of any user visiting the website, but this data is not used to develop a personal profile of you.__
