# TV Licensing - TV Licensing privacy and security policies

'TV Licensing' is a trade mark of the BBC and is used under licence by companies contracted by the BBC to administer the collection of the television licence fee and enforcement of the television licensing system. We (the BBC) are a public authority in respect of our television licensing functions and we retain overall responsibility. We are also the data controller of personal data processed by TV Licensing.

We are committed to safeguarding your personal information. This commitment extends to our TV Licensing contractors and subcontractors. Whenever you provide us with your personal information, we are legally obliged to use it in line with all laws concerning the protection of such information, including the Data Protection Act 1998 (these laws are referred to collectively in this Privacy Policy as the "data protection laws"). The BBC is the data controller under the Data Protection Act 1998 in respect of our TV Licensing functions.

In order to identify you and communicate with you about TV Licensing matters you may be asked to provide:

  * Your name.
  * Your TV Licence number or membership number for cash payment schemes.
  * Your postal address(es).
  * Your bank account details or your credit/debit card details.
  * Your telephone number.
  * Information about whether or not you use a TV at an address.
  * Your National Insurance number (if applying for a free over 75 licence).
  * Other contact details such as an email address.

In addition to the information you provide us directly, we may also record the following information about you or obtain it from third parties:

  * Personal information and contact information about licensable properties, e.g. information about changes of address or telephone numbers, in order to administer the licensing system.

  * We may also collect information from third parties on whether a TV is being used at an address. An example of this is where we receive a notification from a TV Dealer that television receiving equipment has been purchased.
  * Information about any access restrictions to a particular property.
  * Where necessary, we may collect information (such as statements of evidence) relevant to any investigation or prosecution related to a TV licensing offence.

  * To understand and improve the effectiveness of the TV Licensing website.
  * For historical, statistical or research purposes.
  * To assist in developing better ways of administering the TV Licensing system.



The majority of personal data we hold is processed within the UK. However, some data is processed outside of the European Economic Area. We only allow the processing of personal data outside of the European Economic Area when we are satisfied that there is an appropriate level of protection for our customers’ personal data and where appropriate contractual obligations and safeguards have been put in place.

##### 4.2. Will we share your personal information with anyone else?

We will never sell your data to anyone. Any information you provide will only be used by us and our service providers for the purposes of administering TV Licensing. We will not disclose your data to any other third parties without obtaining your prior consent unless we are required or permitted to do so by law (for example, to law enforcement agencies).

##### 4.3. Will my personal information be kept secure?

We take Information Security extremely seriously. We will take all appropriate measures to ensure that all personal information that is under our control is held securely and in accordance with relevant data protection laws. We use strict procedures and security features to prevent any unauthorised access to, or misuse or loss of, your personal information.

Please note that unless encrypted, email messages are not secure and therefore could be intercepted and read by someone else. Please bear this in mind when deciding whether to include personal or sensitive information in any email messages you send to us.

##### 4.4. When will we send you emails and text messages?

###### 4.4.1. Email

There are a number of different ways you can receive emails from TV Licensing.

  1. **Receiving an electronic copy of your TV Licence**

When purchasing your licence you can choose to have it sent to you via email. Please see the TV Licensing website for answers to frequently asked questions on receiving your licence via email.

  2. **Receiving your TV Licence renewal reminders and other important information by email**
    1. If you purchased your licence via the TV Licensing website 

When purchasing a TV Licence at www.tvlicensing.co.uk you are required to provide a valid email address. We may then email you other messages regarding your TV Licence including reminders that your licence is about to expire. If you would prefer to receive these messages by post rather than email you can change your communication preferences via one of the methods set out in section 4.5.

    2. If you did not purchase your licence via the TV Licensing website 

You can change the way you receive messages from TV Licensing (including choosing to receive messages via email) by [updating your details](https://web.archive.org/yourlicence/) or by contacting us by phone, email or post.

  3. **Receiving information relating to your licence instalment payment plan by email**

When choosing to pay for your licence via an instalment payment plan, you may choose to have information relating to that payment plan sent to you via email.




Customer email addresses will not be sold to anyone. Nor will they be used by, distributed to, or shared with anyone other than the BBC and its service providers in connection with TV Licensing.

If you choose to provide us with an email address then it is your responsibility to ensure that it is valid and to notify TV Licensing of any changes. You can [change your email address online](https://web.archive.org/yourlicence/) or via phone or post.

###### 4.4.2. Text messages

If you provide us with your mobile phone number, we will only use it to contact you via text message if we have your consent to do so.

##### 4.5. How do I stop receiving emails and/or text messages?

There are a number of ways in which you can stop (i.e. unsubscribe from) receiving emails and/or text messages from TV Licensing (refer to 4.5.1 – 4.5.3.). When you unsubscribe from either text message and/or email communications, we will record your decision and will not use your email address or mobile phone number for such messages again unless you decide to subscribe to such communications again (refer to 4.6).

You can unsubscribe from email contact at any point (refer to 4.5.3). However, if you do so less than a month before your current TV Licence expires the changes may not come into effect in time to receive a renewal reminder by post so you may still receive your reminder by email. This is because it takes up to four weeks to change your preferences from email to postal communications.

###### 4.5.1. Unsubscribe via the TV Licensing website

You can [unsubscribe from receiving emails from TV Licensing by updating your details via the website](https://web.archive.org/yourlicence/) and following the instructions.

###### 4.5.2. Unsubscribe via phone or post

###### 4.5.3. Unsubscribe via the instructions contained in the emails / texts themselves.

You may unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions included within any email or text message that we send to you. Please note that a minority of texts and emails (e.g. receipts for electronic payment) will not contain unsubscribe instructions. If the text or email you receive does not contain an unsubscribe link, you are still able to unsubscribe by using the methods set out at 4.5.1 and 4.5.2..

##### 4.6. How do I start receiving emails and/or text messages if I’ve previously asked for those messages to be stopped?

If you want to start receiving text messages again simply contact us using the methods described in 4.5.2. To start receiving emails again, [update your details on the website](https://web.archive.org/yourlicence/) or contact us using the methods described in 4.5.2.

If you are not the licence holder but are authorised to update details on the licence holder’s behalf (for example, if you have Power of Attorney), we may ask you to provide proof that the licence holder permits changes to the personal information held before we will make the changes requested.

Please contact us for full details on who is authorised to update another person’s account details on their behalf.

Under the [Data Protection Act 1998](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents) you have the right to request copies of the personal information we hold about you and to have any inaccuracies corrected. This is known as a subject access request. We charge £10 for copies of personal information and you are required to prove your identity with two pieces of approved identification:

  * A copy of passport or photocard drivers’ licence; and
  * A copy of a bank statement or utility bill dated within the last 3 months.



We will use reasonable efforts to supply, correct or delete personal information about you on our files. Please address requests for copies of personal information to the TV Licensing Senior Policy Advisor, BBC TV Licensing Management Team, Room 4436, BBC White City, 201 Wood Lane, London W12 7TS.

The TV Licensing website includes: www.tvlicensing.co.uk and cashplans.tvlicensing.co.uk.

##### 8.1. Links to other websites

The TV Licensing website may contain links and references to other websites. Please be aware that this Privacy Policy does not apply to those websites and we encourage you to read the Privacy Policy of the other websites you visit.

##### 8.2. Internet Protocol Addresses

Technical information is gathered about you without you actively providing it through the use of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), so you can access the Internet. In most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing from time to time as you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user's computer). We log the IP address of any user visiting the website, but this data is not used to develop a personal profile of you.

##### 8.3. Web statistics

We use web analytics to analyse site usage and statistics but this application does not identify any personal information. Using web analytics helps us to understand usage patterns on our website and to make improvements to our service.

##### 8.4. Cookies

###### 8.4.1. What is a cookie?

A cookie is a computer file containing a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is stored on your computer, mobile phone or tablet by the website you are visiting. Each website can send its own cookie to your device. You can usually manage cookies from your web browser (e.g. Internet Explorer, Firefox or Chrome). Cookies are commonly used and enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether you have visited the website before, record your preferences on how you use a website, operate ‘shopping carts’ and so on.

Please note that as part of implementation of new regulations currently being introduced in the UK, we are actively reviewing how we use cookies, including whether any further advice should be given or consent gained from users of our website. This will likely result in the TV Licensing Privacy Policy being amended to reflect any changes required. We are also currently preparing a list of all TV Licensing cookies. This list will be incorporated into the TV Licensing Privacy Policy when finalised.

###### 8.4.2. How does TV Licensing use cookies?

On the TV Licensing website, cookies record information about your online preferences (e.g. the pages you visit the most) and assist with online purchases of TV Licences.

We also use a number of independent measurement and research companies to gather information regarding the visitors to TV Licensing sites on our behalf using cookies, log file data and code which is embedded on our website. We use this type of information to help improve the services we provide to users. We strictly require that third parties do not use any information for their own business or any other purposes.

###### 8.4.3. What sort of cookies are used on the TV Licensing website?

On the TV Licensing website we use two types of cookies: session cookies and stored cookies.

  * **Session cookies** \- these are temporary cookie files, which are erased when you close your web browser. When you restart your web browser and go back to the site that created the cookie, the website will not remember you.
  * **Stored cookies** – these are stored on your computer and are not automatically deleted when the web browser is closed.



###### 8.4.4. Can I browse the TV Licensing website without receiving any cookies?

Depending on the web-browser that you use to access our website, you may have the ability to accept or decline cookies locally within your browser. Options include accepting all cookies automatically, notifying you when a cookie is downloaded, or not receiving cookies at any time. These options may be found in the ‘preferences’ section of your web browser. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. You may find the www.aboutcookies.org website useful for information on how to change cookie settings in a range of commonly used browsers.

If you set your computer to reject cookies, you can still browse www.tvlicensing.co.uk and cashplans.tvlicensing.co.uk. However, certain functions will not be available to you including paying for your TV Licence and updating your details.

###### 8.4.5. How do third party organisations which carry TV Licensing advertising material use cookies?

We use a range of advertising channels (including television, radio and online) in order to raise awareness, explain the law relating to TV licensing, provide information about ways to pay and deter evaders. They include television, radio and online campaigns.

Where online campaigns are used (for example, banner advertisements on third party websites), a TV Licensing cookie will be sent to your browser from the third party website's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. However we will ensure that cookies set by TV Licensing from third party sites comply with the TV Licensing Privacy Policy and we will not collect personal data during this process.

It is the responsibility of third party websites themselves to provide information about non-TVL cookies that may be served from their site. We therefore recommend that you check the cookies policy of any external sites if you would like to know more about their use of cookies.

We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. New versions will be posted on the TV Licensing website. If material changes are made to the Privacy Policy we will notify you by placing a prominent notice on our website.
