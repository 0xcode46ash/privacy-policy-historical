## How we receive information about you

|   
|  |   
| We receive information from you in four ways: 

Directly from you. When you apply for a television licence we ask for information about yourself to allow us to correctly process your payment, to send your licence and to contact you by mail, telephone, email or other methods in the future on matters relating to your licence. See the detailed statements on individual web pages describing how your information will be used. 

From third parties. We may ask for information about you from third parties, for example when we get authorisation for a payment you make using a credit or debit card. 

From the site. The data that we collect does not identify you as an individual. We use 'first party session cookies'. Please click on the link for more information on how we use cookies 

From our advertising. We may use cookies to help measure and improve the effectiveness of our banners and emails in order to make sure that our publicity spend is allocated wisely.
