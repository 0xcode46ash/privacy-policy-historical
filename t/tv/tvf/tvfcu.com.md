We may disclose all of the information that we collect, as described above, to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements.

We will protect your personal information by maintaining strong security measures and controls to ensure your member information in our files and computers are protected. We will use security-coding techniques to protect against unauthorized access to your personal records, ensure accuracy and integrity of communications and transactions, and protect your confidentiality. 

We will partner only with those businesses that follow strict confidentiality requirements. These business partners will offer products designed to enhance your well-being and under no circumstances will we authorize these firms to charge your account without your express consent. In addition, be assured we will not sell your member information to third party telemarketing firms. 

Remember that you will always have access to your information and the opportunity to review your information to make any necessary changes to ensure our records are accurate and complete. You also have a responsibility to safeguard your financial information at all times. 

Protection of your privacy is very important to us and we will continue to review the measures we take in order to do so, which means this Privacy Policy may change from time to time.
