# Privacy Policy | TVGuide.com

TV Guide Online Holdings LLC and its parents and affiliated entities (collectively, "TV Guide") are committed to protecting TV Guide users' privacy. This privacy policy (this "Privacy Policy"), as set forth below, covers tvguide.com (the "Website") and applies solely to information collected on the Website. Please read this Privacy Policy to understand how TV Guide will treat personally and non-personally identifiable information TV Guide collects on the Website. TV Guide’s use of information collected on the Website will be subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If personally identifiable information is derived from a source other than through the Website, this Privacy Policy will not apply to such information. Your use of the Website constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy was last updated on May 5, 2009, and may change from time to time, so please check back periodically since your continued use of the Website subsequent to any changes in this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. The Terms of Use for the Website are hereby incorporated herein by this reference.

Types of Personally Identifiable Information Collected From You.

TV Guide recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information collected about visitors to the Website. As used in this Privacy Policy, “personally identifiable information” means your name, your postal address, your phone number and your email address. You can use much of the Website without divulging any personally identifiable information. Examples of situations in which you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information to use a portion of the Website may include portions of the Website used to complete voluntary sweepstakes or contest entry forms, to complete your registration on the Website or to use certain voluntary services offered on the Website, including community postings such as the Website community, chats and bulletin boards.

Other Types of Information Collected From You.

Information that is not personally identifiable information is referred to in this Privacy Policy as “Non-Identifying Information.” Non-Identifying Information may include information that you submit to TV Guide via the Website in response to a request that the Website makes of you, such as your television service provider, zip code, birth date, hometown, preferences and survey answers. Non-Identifying Information may also include information that is automatically collected as your computer interacts with TV Guide’s servers, such as clickstream information (internet protocol ("IP") address, internet service provider, platform type, date/time stamp) http protocol information (last URL requested and browser type), interaction information (browser interaction such as when the mouse moves over an image), computer information (computer and browser information) and search terms (search text). 

Communications Preferences.

When you register on the Website, you may opt to receive particular types of email newsletters. If you later change your mind about your preferences, you can change your elections by visiting the “My Settings” tab on the Website or contacting TV Guide at the email or physical address listed in "How to Contact TV Guide" below. Please note that if you ask not to receive email newsletters, you may still receive the newsletters for a short time thereafter (as it may take some time for your preferences to be updated throughout TV Guide’s computer systems), and you may still receive emails in certain other circumstances (e.g., welcome messages you receive when signing up for other services, billing statements, service status notifications, notifications about terms of use or privacy changes). Please read the rest of this Privacy Policy to learn how unaffiliated third parties may contact you. 

Use of Personally Identifiable Information.

Providing Services and Quality Assurance. TV Guide uses personally identifiable information to help TV Guide operate the Website, to deliver the services you have requested, to perform quality assurance, sales analyses and other business analyses and to contact you in connection with TV Guide’s services. In some cases TV Guide may use service providers to help TV Guide perform some of these tasks, including, but not limited to, performing customer service, business analyses or quality control, and TV Guide may share your personally identifiable information with these service providers. In such cases, TV Guide may require these service providers to enter into agreements with TV Guide regarding the confidential handling of your information. 

Contacting You. TV Guide may use personally identifiable information to contact you. Please read the “Communications Preferences” section above to learn how your personally identifiable information may be used to contact you. 

Providing Merchants with Personally Identifiable Information. TV Guide may sell goods or services, allow you to make reservations or allow you to participate in (or register for) contests, sweepstakes or other offers or programs (such as discount or rewards programs, magazine subscriptions, hotel bookings or cruises) on the Website. Typically, these goods, services, contests, sweepstakes or other offers or programs ("Special Offers") are provided by third parties ("Merchants"). By electing to engage in a Merchant's Special Offer, you are authorizing TV Guide to provide that Merchant with your personally identifiable information. Because Merchants are not part of TV Guide, Merchants are not subject to this Privacy Policy and may use your personally identifiable information to communicate with you by sending emails or through other means and may share that information with others. If you want to learn about a particular Merchant's privacy policies, or if you do not want to receive communications from a particular Merchant, or if you have other questions, instructions or concerns to which you would like a Merchant to respond, you must contact that Merchant directly. 

Divulging Personally Identifiable Information for Legal, Administrative and Corporate Reasons. TV Guide may disclose specific personally identifiable information when TV Guide determines that such disclosure will be helpful to comply with law or a judicial order or process, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of TV Guide or other visitors to the Website or users of services or products provided by TV Guide or to take part with others in joint anti-piracy activities. Also, your personally identifiable information may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets, or a bankruptcy, of all or any part of TV Guide. 

Responsibility. TV Guide will not be responsible or otherwise liable for any use or disclosure of your personally identifiable information by a third party to which TV Guide is allowed to disclose such information under this Privacy Policy.

How TV Guide Uses Non-Identifying Information.

TV Guide may use your Non-Identifying Information to perform business analyses or to tailor the Website and communications to your interests. TV Guide may share anonymous, aggregated (grouped) Non-Identifying Information with advertisers and other third parties so that they can tailor their advertisements and communications to the appropriate audience. Also, any time that TV Guide is allowed under this Privacy Policy to share your personally identifiable information, TV Guide may also share your Non-Identifying Information along with it on an anonymous or non-anonymous basis.

Information Third Party Websites May Collect From You.

On the Website, TV Guide places links to other websites operated by other parties. Some of these other websites contain TV Guide’s brand names and trademarks and other intellectual property that TV Guide owns; others do not. When you click on these links and visit these other websites, regardless of whether or not they contain TV Guide brand names, trademarks and other intellectual property, you need to be aware that TV Guide does not control these other websites or these other websites' business practices, and that this Privacy Policy does not apply to these other websites. Consequently, the operators of these other websites may collect the same or different kinds of information about you, and may use and disclose that information in different ways than TV Guide would if it were collected on the Website. TV Guide encourages you to review any third party websites’ privacy policies and remind you that TV Guide is not responsible for their actions. 

Your IP Address

Like many websites, each time you visit the Website, TV Guide may automatically collect your IP address and the web page from which you came. In order to administer and optimize the Website for you and to diagnose problems with the Website, TV Guide may use your IP address to help identify you and to gather broad Non-Identifying Information about you. 

Cookies

Like many websites, the Website uses cookies to help it keep track of your purchases and other activity on the Website and enhance your experience on the Website. TV Guide also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to facilitate the retrieval of information so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Website. On the Website, others may place or read cookies on your browser as well. If you wish to disable these cookies, the "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how. However, if you set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas or features of the Website.

The Website is a general audience website and TV Guide does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age on the Website.

Public Areas

The Website may provide you with the opportunity to post information for display in areas of the Website that are accessible to viewing by the general public ("public areas"), including, but not limited to, bulletin boards, chat rooms and user-submitted concert or other event reviews. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information that you submit for use in public areas. TV Guide asks that you do not submit any personally identifiable information for display in public areas, as other people who use the Website will see it. If you submit such information for display in public areas, TV Guide cannot prevent it from being used in a manner that violates the law, your personal privacy or your safety. By submitting such information for display in public areas, you assume the risks and sole liability arising as a result of such information being displayed. 

Changing and Deleting Information

You may change your personal information, certain Non-Identifying Information and email alert communications preferences on the Website by visiting the “My Settings” tab on the Website or contacting TV Guide at the email or physical address listed in "How to Contact TV Guide" below. If you would like to delete your registration from the Website, please contact TV Guide at the email or postal mail address below. Please note that deleting your registration will not delete all of your personally identifiable information or other information contained on TV Guide’s systems, as much or all of this information may be retained for an indefinite duration to preserve records of TV Guide’s relationship with you. Further, certain information may have already been provided to third parties as described above.
