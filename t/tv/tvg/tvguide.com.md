TV Guide Online, Inc. ("TV Guide") is committed to protecting its users' privacy. This Privacy Policy (this "Privacy Policy"), as set forth below, covers tvguide.com (”tvguide.com” or the "website") and applies solely to information collected on tvguide.com. Please read this Privacy Policy to understand how we will treat personally and non-personally identifiable information we collect on tvguide.com. “We” and “our” as used in this Privacy Policy, means TV Guide, the owner of the website, and TV Guide’s affiliated companies (which include, but are not limited to, TV Guide Magazine Group, Inc., TV Guide Networks, Inc. and Gemstar-TV Guide International, Inc.) and our affiliated companies’ use of information collected on TVGuide.com will be subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If personally identifiable information was derived from a source other than through tvguide.com, however, this Privacy Policy will not apply to such information. This Privacy Policy was last updated on July 31, 2007, and may change from time to time, so please check back periodically since your continued use of the website indicates your acceptance of any such changes. 

What personally identifiable information is collected from me?

We recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information collected about visitors to tvguide.com. As used in this Privacy Policy, “personally identifiable information” means your name, your postal address, your phone number and your email address. You can use much of the website without divulging any personally identifiable information. Examples of situations in which you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information to use a portion of the website may include portions of the website used to subscribe to TV Guide magazine, to complete sweepstakes entry forms, to complete your registration on tvguide.com or to use certain services offered on the website, including community postings such as the tvguide.com community, chats and bulletin boards. 

Other types of information

Information that is not personally identifiable information is referred to in this Privacy Policy as “Non-Identifying Information”. Non-Identifying Information may include information that you submit to us via the website in response to a request that the website makes of you, such as your TV service provider, zip code, birth date, hometown, preferences and survey answers. Non-Identifying Information may also include information that is automatically collected as your computer interacts with our servers, such as clickstream information (internet protocol ("IP") address, internet service provider, platform type, date/time stamp) http protocol information (last URL requested and browser type), interaction information (browser interaction such as when the mouse moves over an image), computer information (computer and browser information) and search terms (search text). 

Communications Preferences

When you register on the website, you may opt to receive particular types of email newsletters. If you later change your mind about your preferences, you can change your elections by visiting the Basic Information page on tvguide.com or contacting us at the email or physical address listed in "How to Contact Us" below. Please note that if you ask not to receive email newsletters, you may still receive the newsletters for a short time thereafter (as it may take some time for your preferences to be updated throughout our computer systems), and you may still receive emails in certain other circumstances (e.g., welcome messages you receive when signing up for other services, billing statements, service status notifications, notifications about terms of use or privacy changes). Please read the rest of this Privacy Policy to learn how unaffiliated third parties may contact you.

Communications Preferences

Providing Services and Quality Assurance. We use personally identifiable information to help us operate the website, to deliver the services you have requested, to perform quality assurance, sales analyses and other business analyses and to contact you in connection with our services. In some cases we may use service providers to help us perform some of these tasks, including, but not limited to, performing customer service, business analyses or quality control, and we may share your personally identifiable information with these service providers. In such cases, we may require these service providers to enter into agreements with us regarding the confidential handling of your information.

We may sell goods or services, allow you to make reservations or allow you to participate in (or register for) contests, sweepstakes or other offers or programs (such as discount or rewards programs, magazine subscriptions, hotel bookings or cruises) on the website. Typically, these goods, services, contests, sweepstakes or other offers or programs ("Special Offers") are provided by third parties ("Merchants"). By electing to engage in a Merchant's Special Offer, you are authorizing us to provide that Merchant with your personally identifiable information. Because Merchants are not part of TV Guide, Merchants are not subject to this Privacy Policy and may use your personally identifiable information to communicate with you by sending emails or through other means and may share that information with others. If you want to learn about a particular Merchant's privacy policies, if you do not want to receive communications from a particular Merchant, or if you have other questions, instructions or concerns to which you would like a Merchant to respond, you must contact that Merchant directly. 

Divulging Personally Identifiable Information for Legal, Administrative and Corporate Reasons. We may disclose specific personally identifiable information when we determine that such disclosure will be helpful to comply with law or a judicial order or process, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of TV Guide or other visitors to the website or users of services or products provided by TV Guide or to take part with others in joint anti-piracy activities. Also, your personally identifiable information may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets, or a bankruptcy, of TV Guide. 

Other Instances where Personally Identifiable Information may be Shared. We use personally identifiable information to help us operate the website, to deliver the services you have requested, to perform quality assurance, sales analyses and other business analyses and to contact you in connection with our services. In some cases we may use service providers to help us perform some of these tasks, including, but not limited to, performing customer service, business analyses or quality control, and we may share your personally identifiable information with these service providers. In such cases, we may require these service providers to enter into agreements with us regarding the confidential handling of your information.

Information Other Web Websites Collect From You

On tvguide.com, we place links to other web sites operated by other parties. Some of these other web sites contain our brand names and trademarks and other intellectual property that we own; others do not. When you click on these links and visit these other web sites, regardless of whether or not they contain our brand names, trademarks and other intellectual property, you need to be aware that we do not control these other websites or these other web sites' business practices, and that this Privacy Policy does not apply to these other web sites. Consequently, the operators of these other web sites may collect different kinds of information about you, and may use and disclose that information in different ways than we would if it were collected on tvguide.com. We encourage you to review the third party websites privacy policies and remind you that we are not responsible for their actions.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information that you submit for use in public areas. We ask that you do not submit any personally identifiable information for display in public areas, as other people who use the website will see it. If you submit such information for display in public areas, we cannot prevent it from being used in a manner that violates the law, your personal privacy or your safety. By submitting such information for display in public areas, you assume the risks and sole liability arising as a result of such information being displayed.

Further, certain information may have already been provided to third parties as described above.
