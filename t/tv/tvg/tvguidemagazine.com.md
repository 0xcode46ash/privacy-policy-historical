### Information We Collect

The information we gather on our site falls into two categories: (1) information you supply when you register or initiate transactions, and (2) tracking information collected as you navigate through our site. Third-party providers featured on or linked to from our site, such as vendors of products and services offered through our site, may gather information, as well.

**(1) Personally Identifying Information**  
To use certain features on our site, we ask you to register. When you register, we collect personally identifying information about you, including but not limited to: name, email address, user name and password, etc. In addition, at various other points on our site, we may ask you for personally identifying information including when you: place an order for products, complete a survey, or report a problem with our site. We use this information to process your orders, to tailor our site to your interests, make it more useful to you, and help improve our site generally. Through certain promotions, you can submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person’s name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift online or offline and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient’s name and address. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages include but are not limited to: recipient’s name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.

On occasion, we may offer contests or other promotions involving marketing or advertising partners. If you choose to participate in one of these contests or promotions, you'll have to provide some information about yourself (such as name, address, and email address). We may share this information with sponsors of the contest or other promotional partners, but we will always identify the other parties involved (for example, in the contest rules) and provide notice that your registration may be disclosed to these parties. We don't control these third parties' privacy practices, and our Privacy Policy does not apply to their collection and use of your information. We urge you to review their privacy policies and learn how they will use your information before participating. If you don't want us to collect the information requested in connection with a promotion, or to provide it to our co-sponsors or partners, please do not participate in the promotion.

**(2) Non-Identifying Information**  
Non-Identifying Information may include information that you submit to us via the website such as your TV service provider, zip code, birth date, hometown, preferences and survey answers. It may also include information that is automatically collected as your computer interacts with our servers, such as clickstream information (internet protocol (“IP”) address, internet service provider, platform type, date/time stamp), http protocol information (last URL requested and browser type), interaction information (browser interaction such as when the mouse moves over an image), computer information (computer and browser information) and search terms (search text). 

We also utilize "cookies," text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering on our site. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. We use them to understand Internet usage and to improve our content, offerings, and advertisements. 

We may also use small pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear gifs" to collect anonymous and aggregate advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses. These "web beacons" may be used to deliver cookies that conform to our cookie policy.

### How Your Information Will Be Used

Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide you with a customized experience when visiting our site and to make our site more valuable to you.

We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests or when we make changes to subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us. We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them your gifts or cards. From time to time, we also may use this information to offer our products, programs, or services to them.

If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g., a "letter to our editors"), we may publish your name, screen name, and other information you have provided to us. 

The information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, or services. 

We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our publications and websites and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We reserve the right to use, transfer, sell, and share aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group for any business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services. 

We also may provide links to other websites, and provide access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we don't control. When you access another website or purchase products or services or conduct other transactions through our website, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you're visiting or the provider of such products or services. When you provide information in the course of obtaining products or services through our site, use of any information you provide may be governed by the privacy policy of the provider of those products or services, even if it appears that you're on one of our sites throughout the transaction. The provider's privacy policy may differ from ours. We encourage you to review the third party websites privacy policies and remind you that we are not responsible for their actions.

We may transfer your personally identifiable information to other TV Guide Magazine, LLC offices for internal management and administrative purposes. In some cases we may use service providers to help us perform some of these tasks, including, but not limited to, performing customer service, business analyses or quality control, and we may share your personally identifiable information with these service providers. In such cases, we may require these service providers to enter into agreements with us regarding the confidential handling of your information. Transfers of personally identifiable information may also be made where necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. 

We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, (ie: in response to a court order or a subpoena) or in response to a law enforcement agency's request. We also may disclose such information to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our site, the public, or TV Guide Magazine, LLC.

As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the event all or a portion of the assets owned or controlled by TV Guide Magazine, its parent or any subsidiary or affiliated entity are sold, assigned, transferred or acquired by another company, the information from and/or about our Website users may be among the transferred assets.

### Security

Because no data transmission over the Internet is completely secure, and no system of physical or electronic security is impenetrable, TV Guide Magazine cannot guarantee the security of the information you send to us or the security of our servers or databases, and by using the website you agree to assume all risk in connection with the information sent to us or collected by us when you use the website. In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you. If notification is appropriate, we may notify you by e-mail (provided we have your e-mail address). 

The website may provide you with the opportunity to post information for display in areas of the website that are accessible to viewing by the general public (“public areas”), including, but not limited to, bulletin boards, chat rooms, and user-submitted comments. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information that you submit for use in public areas. We ask that you do not submit any personally identifiable information for display in public areas, as other people who use the website will see it. If you submit such information for display in public areas, we cannot prevent it from being used in a manner that violates the law, your personal privacy or your safety. By submitting such information for display in public areas, you assume the risks and sole liability arising as a result of such information being displayed.

The Subscription Privacy Policy summarizes the various ways that TV Guide Magazine LLC (“Service Provider,” “we” or “our”) treats the information you provide when subscribing to the magazine. 

In order to take your order and fulfill your subscription, we may ask you for personally identifiable information such as your name, address, email address, credit card information and phone number.

In many cases, such as subscription orders and for certain promotions, only those who provide us with requested information will be able to use our services.

The information you provide us allows us to service your account efficiently and fulfill your requests for our products and services. We use your personal information to respond to your questions about your subscription, to communicate with you about the status of your subscription and to notify you if you’ve won one of our contests. We might also share your information with reputable partners offering products and services we think may be useful to you. Please be assured that TV Guide Magazine will never share your credit card information with our partners, and we do not store credit card information on any subscriber record once the authorized charge has been processed. 

In the case of a gift subscription, we use the information you provide to us about others to allow us to send them gift subscriptions and/or gift cards. On occasion, we may also use this information to make them aware of special services or products that they might find interesting.

It is our goal to offer you the highest level of service possible and we have set up technical and operational barriers to protect your personal information. We take appropriate measures to ensure that the personal information you provide us with is used as described in this policy.
