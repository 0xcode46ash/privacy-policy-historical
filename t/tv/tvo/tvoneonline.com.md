TV One, LLC respects the privacy of visitors to our site. Please read this privacy policy carefully so that you understand our privacy practices for our radio-one.com site. Questions regarding privacy issues should be directed to TV One’s Legal Department at (301) 306-1111. 

  This site does not distinguish users based on age criteria and we do not specifically target any of our content to children under the age of 13. Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. We won't knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide any other personally identifying information. 

The information gathered by TV One on this site falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to our site when they request information about TV One, and (2) non personally-identifiable information about our visitors' connection to the Internet collected by our servers. When visitors submit information to TV One through this site, TV One will use this information only to provide the requested information and services. Individuals within TV One who have a need to view the information will have access to the information submitted by visitors to this site. 

  From the “Careers” section of the site, TV One posts certain employee positions for which you are invited to apply by sending a copy of your resume via facsimile or e-mail. TV One uses the information you provide solely for purposes of considering you for employment opportunities, and does not share such information with any third party, absent your express consent. 

As you browse our site, our web servers may collect information about your visit, not about you personally. For example, we may monitor statistics such as: 

  * how may people visit the site;
  * which pages people visit on the site;
  * from which domains our visitors come; and
  * which browsers people use to visit the site.



TV One may use these statistics to improve the site, to monitor its performance, and to make the site easier for you and other visitors to use. 

We may occasionally release information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our terms of use, or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our site, the public, or TV One. As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that TV One, the bulk of our assets or our site is acquired by another company, information relating to our visitors would be among the transferred assets. 

  Some portions of the site contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites’ privacy policies, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties. 

The Web is an evolving medium. If we need to change our privacy policy at some point in the future, we'll post the changes before they take effect. By visiting our site, you agree that your visit, and any dispute over our privacy practices, is governed by this privacy policy and our terms of use.
