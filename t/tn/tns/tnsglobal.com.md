##  TNS Online Data Protection Notice 

Your privacy is important to us and we shall take care to safeguard it. This privacy policy applies to individuals who wish to find out more about TNS’s corporate products and services, and/or employment opportunities at our firm. It applies to personal data submitted at <http://www.tnsglobal.com/> and pages hosted by OpenHire, a third party hiring management system. 

This privacy policy does NOT apply to respondents who have completed or are about to complete a market research survey. For the privacy policy relevant to such surveys you should contact the local TNS company that has asked you to complete the survey. The relevant privacy policy for surveys conducted by TNS companies in North America can be accessed at: [www.tns-us.com/privacy/](http://www.tns-us.com/privacy/). 

##  When and what information do we collect? 

Your personal data is collected when you complete and submit the enquiry form, the resume form in the Careers section of our site, or when you speak to us over the telephone. In particular, TNS will collect and hold details of your name, address, email address, telephone number, (including mobile number), fax number, any information that you provide about areas of interest to you, information that you provide in response to any TNS marketing campaigns, and any other personal information disclosed by you. We believe that details of your areas of interest or responses will assist us in tailoring more specific communications to you in the future. Any information you provide to us will be treated with care and respect. 

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you may send us an email at the address indicated in the Contacting us section below. 

##  What do we do with your personal information? 

By submitting the enquiry form you consent to us using the personal data contained in the form to provide you with emails or correspondence containing information about TNS products and services. Such information may include press releases, product offers, product launches, invitations to seminars or to exhibitions or to attend TNS workshops, newsletters, e-newsletters, market research articles, industry analysis, corporate or financial announcements as well as general responses to any other information which you may have requested. In addition, you consent to us occasionally contacting you (including by telephone) to notify you about changes to the website and new information or services which we think you may find interesting or valuable. 

By completing our resume submission form, you consent to us keeping your personal information on file for the purpose of considering your candidacy for a current employment opportunity with TNS and/or to contact you if a future position matches your profile. If we believe that you may be a suitable candidate for a current or future position, we may contact you by phone, email or postal mail to discuss your interest in working at TNS and/or to invite you to a job interview. 

##  With whom will we share your information? 

You consent to us sharing your personal information with other companies within the Taylor Nelson Sofres group. When completing an enquiry form on our site for a local contact, you will see the name of the TNS company in the country that you select. By submitting the form, your personal information will be shared with this TNS company. TNS and its affiliate companies will use the information that you submit to respond to your inquiry. 

We may also share your personal information with selected business partners/clients for the purpose of informing you about our and our business partners’ products and services. Other companies within the Taylor Nelson Sofres group and selected business partners/clients may from time to time contact you on matters, which may be of interest to you. You may opt-out of receiving such news and promotional communications, at any time, by notifying us by email (see Contacting us below). 

In the Careers section of our site, we have retained a third party company, OpenHire, to manage resumes submitted for North American employment opportunities. OpenHire hosts the resume submission form even though it appears that users are still on the TNS site. If you submit your resume using the form on the TNS North America Career Opportunity site, only a limited number of TNS staff will have access to it. OpenHire is contractually bound to keep your information confidential and is not allowed to use it for its own promotional purposes. 

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information In the rare but possible circumstance that the information is subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, orders or for similar legal or regulatory requirements.  
Contacting us  
Please notify us by email to [enquiries@tns-global.com](mailto:enquiries@tns-global.com) if you: 

(a) do not wish your personal data to be used in the manner described above (we should be grateful if you set out your specific objections to any use); 

(b) wish to see the personal data we hold about you. We will endeavour to respond to your access request within 30 days of receiving your request. Of course, if the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, incomplete or irrelevant, we shall correct or delete it after discussing the matter with you.
