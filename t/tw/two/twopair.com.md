This data is utilized in the aggregate to help us look for trends so that we can improve our Web site and your user experience.

You may receive periodic mailings, emails or telephone calls from us about new products and services, discounts, special promotions or upcoming events.

The only America's Best employees with access to your information are those employees who need the information to do their jobs. All employees are educated about America's Best policies and practices in regard to safeguarding customer information, preventing its unauthorized access, use or disclosure and ensuring its proper handling.

America's Best does not rent, sell or exchange personally identifiable information about its customers. The Company may provide information to regulatory authorities, law enforcement officials or other government agencies when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

##### What Are "Cookies" and Do We Use Them?

A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by us that is saved on the hard disk by your computer's browser. It holds information we may need to interact with you and personalize your experience. Most Web browsers allow you to exercise control over cookie files on your computer by erasing them, blocking them, or notifying you when such a file is stored. You should take a look at your particular browser for instructions on this function. If you elect to disable an America's Best cookie, you may not be able to take full advantage of our Web site.

##### How Is Data Secured?

America's Best is committed to doing its best to maintain the security of all information collected on our site. When credit card information is transmitted online, America's Best uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) server software to prevent unauthorized access to the information. SSL is a highly sophisticated method of scrambling data as it travels from your computer to our Web site's servers. You can identify the secure connection by looking for a locked padlock icon at the lower portion of your browser window.
