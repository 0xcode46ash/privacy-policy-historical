# Privacy Policy

Last updated: July 3, 2013

We know that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.

## What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?

This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personal information that we gather when you use any of our services (the "Services"). This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.

## What Personal Information Do We Collect?

Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a friendly, customized, and efficient experience. We collect the following types of information from our users:

### Information You Provide to Us

We receive and store any information you enter on the Site or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our Site's features. The personal information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain services, customizing the content and advertising you see, and communicating with you about specials, surveys and new products and services.

### Automatic Information

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Friendly App Studio automatically receives and records certain "traffic data" on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Friendly App Studio cookie information, and the page you requested. Friendly App Studio uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends and administer the Site. Our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. This data is only used in the aggregate. This type of collective data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Site, so we can make the Site appealing to as many users as possible. 

### Information From Other Sources

For purposes such as improving personalization of our service, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. Like the information you provide to us, we do not share this information with anyone except authorized third parties in connection with providing you with our Service.

## What about Cookies?

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our Site are visited and by how many people. Friendly App Studio cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your username or e-mail address is.  


## Will Friendly App Studio Share Any of the Information it Receives?

We neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone.

## Can Children Use Friendly App Studio's Services?

Friendly App Studio is not intended for children under 13 years old. You must be over 13 to access our services.

## Third Party Sites

The Site may permit you to link to other websites on the Internet, and other websites may contain links to the Site. These other websites are not under our control. The privacy and security practices of websites linked to or from the Site are not covered by this Privacy Policy, and Friendly App Studio is not responsible for the privacy or security practices or the content of such websites.
