 **Overall privacy statement**  
We take your privacy seriously. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we want to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses the types of information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it. These privacy practices apply to the Web site and its properties and services that you were viewing when you clicked through to this policy, which is operated directly by us, by our partner, or by our affiliate. Please note that by using the services or web site, you agree that any information you provide to us will be stored in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and United States law.

**1\. What information does TWIP collect?**  
Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with the best and most useful content and services. Several of the services and features that we offer on our sites require you to provide us with information as a condition of usage. These include access to subscription-only areas, the ability to post pictures, participation in sweepstakes or contests and subscriptions to email newsletters.

We collect personally identifiable information, such as your username, password, email address, country of residence, gender and date of birth when you provide it to us.

Once you register with TWIP you are less anonymous to us.

**2\. What is TWIP practice regarding cookies?**  
Your Internet browser has a feature called cookies, which stores small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of our sites. You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit most of our sites, although active participation in certain areas of our sites may require cookies. Cookies alone tell us nothing about who you are unless you specifically give us personally identifiable information, in which case we use the information to enhance your services in the ways described below. By adjusting your settings on your browser, you may elect not to allow cookies to be collected.

We allow other companies that are presenting advertisements on our sites and, sometimes, in our newsletters to use tracking technology on your computer. We do not give any personally identifiable information to them as part of this relationship. Unless you visit the Web site of these companies and provide them with personally identifiable information about yourself, these tracking technologies tell those advertisers nothing about who you are. Our advertisers' use of tracking technology is subject to their own privacy policies.

Note: about Google Advertising on this website: Google use cookies for its Adsense program and to publish ads on TWIP. The Dart cookies used by Google allow them to adapt the ad publishing based on internet users behavior. Internet users have the possibility to desactivate Dart cookies.
