# Twibble Privacy Policy — Twibble

**Effective: August 31, 2016**

This Privacy Policy describes the information about you that Twibble, Inc. (“Twibble” or “we”) collects through this website (the “Site”), as well as how that information is used, maintained, and, in some cases, shared. 

Please note that by using this Site, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site.

 **What information do we collect from users and how is it used?**

The following describes the types of personal and other information we may collect about you, and how we use and maintain that information:

 _Registration._   Before you can fully utilize our skills and opportunities matching service (the “Service”), you must register with Twibble by logging in with your Twitter credentials, and by providing us with your email address. ** ** For more information, please see below. We request all of the foregoing information for identification purposes, to communicate with you regarding your account, to collect payment for the Service, and to facilitate the Service. We may keep this information indefinitely.

 _Correspondence._ ** ** If you correspond with us through the Site (or via email), we may gather the communications that you submit in a file specific to you. We may keep this information indefinitely.

 _URL and IP addresses._ ** ** Like many other websites, Twibble collects information about users’ utilization and navigation of the Site. This information helps us to design the Site to better suit our users’ needs. For example, the Site will track the URL that you visited before you came to the Site, the URL to which you next go and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Site. Your IP address also is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information.

 _Information Collected With Cookies._ **  **Like many websites, Twibble also uses cookies on certain pages of the Site. Cookies make using the Internet easier by, among other things, saving your preferences for you. For example, a cookie lets the Site remember that you have registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities at the Site, and which allows you to enter your registration information less frequently while visiting the Site. We may also use cookies to deliver content tailored to your interests. Our cookies may enable us to relate your use of the Site to personally identifying information that you previously submitted, such as calling you by name when you return to the Site. If your browser is set to reject cookies, or if your browser notifies you that you are about to receive a cookie and you reject it, then your use of the Site may not be as efficient or as enjoyable as it would be if the cookie were enabled. The information that we collect with cookies allows us to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze the Site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize the Site’s content and layout.

 **To whom do we disclose information about you that we collect?**

Twibble will not share, rent, sell or otherwise disclose any of the personally identifiable information that we collect about you, except when we have your permission or in any of the following situations:

  * We may disclose to other users of the Service the personally identifiable information about you that we collect and your Profile information, as needed for the proper facilitation of the Service, such as your Twitter account name(s), but _not_  your email address(

  * We may disclose information that we collect about you to unaffiliated third-party contractors, to enable such third parties to perform functions on our behalf in making available the Site and/or the Service or to complete or confirm a transaction that you conduct with us.   

  * We may disclose the results of aggregated data about you for marketing or promotional purposes (for instance, that a certain percentage of out Site’s users are living in the United States). In these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to personally identify you.

  * Information about you in Twibble’s possession may also be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which your personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company. We do not guarantee that any entity receiving such information in connection with one of these transactions will comply with all the terms of this Privacy Policy.

  * Twibble will comply with any subpoena, court order or other legal process requesting any of the information about you in our possession, and Twibble may use such information to establish or exercise our legal rights, or to defend against legal claims.




If you use the Site outside of the United States, information that we collect about you will be transferred to servers inside the United States and maintained indefinitely, which may involve the transfer of information out of countries located in the European Economic Area. By allowing Twibble to collect information about you, you consent to such transfer and processing of your data.

 **What security measures does the Site employ?**

To help protect the privacy of data you transmit through the Site, where personally identifiable information is requested, Twibble uses technology designed to encrypt the information that you input before it is sent to us. In addition, Twibble takes steps intended to protect the user data we collect against unauthorized access. However, you should keep in mind that the Site is run on software, hardware and networks, any component of which may, from time to time, require maintenance or experience problems or breaches of security beyond our control. 

Please also be aware that despite our best intentions and the guidelines outlined in this Privacy Policy, no data transmission over the Internet or encryption method can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

 **How can you correct or update information that we collect about you?**

You may correct or update information collected about you through the Site by managing your account profile or by contacting Twibble at the email or mailing address noted below. We will update our records as promptly as possible. For our records, we may retain original and updated information for reasons such as technical constraints, dispute resolution, troubleshooting and agreement enforcement.

 **What are the policies of linked Sites and other third parties?**

This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you through the Site. You should be aware that when you are on the Site, you may be directed to other websites that are beyond our control, and Twibble is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties or the content of linked websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policy posted on any third-party website that you visit. 

 **How will I know about changes in the Privacy Policy?**

Twibble reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Please visit this page periodically so that you will be apprised of any changes. 

 **What is our policy on children users of the Site?**

We do not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under 13 years old, and no part of the Site is directed to persons under 13. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SITE AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER. If Twibble learns that personally identifiable information of any person under 13 years old has been collected without verifiable parental consent, then Twibble will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has obtained a Twibble account, then you may alert Twibble at the address below and request that we delete that child’s personal information from our systems.

 **Will my employer have access to information that we collect about you?**

If you access the Site as a representative of a third party, such as your employer, that party may review and modify your personal information, ask us to delete your personal information, or request that we cease collecting your personal information. If such a third party asks us to delete your personal information or cease collecting your personal information, we may terminate your right to access the Site.

 **What law governs my use of the Site?**

By choosing to visit the Site or otherwise provide information to Twibble, you agree that any dispute over privacy or the terms contained in this Privacy Policy will be governed by the laws of the State of California.
