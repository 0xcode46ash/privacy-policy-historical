[This Privacy Policy forms part of the Website Terms & Conditions and by submitting your personal information to the Website, you are confirming that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and are agreeing to the uses of your personal information described in it.]

Before you start

Parts of our Website may contain links to third party websites for your convenience and information.  When you access a third party website through such link please understand that we do not control the content and are not responsible for the privacy practices of that site even where they may contain Twinings or associated company logos.  We suggest that you carefully review the privacy policies of those websites linked from our site.  These sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information.

Information collected through our Website

When you visit our Website, we may collect information on two different levels about your visit: (1) Statistical Information, collected as you browse the site, and (2) personal information which you knowingly give to us.

(1) Statistical Information

In general this Website automatically gathers certain usage information such as the number and frequency of visitors to our Website, very much like the television ratings that tell the networks how many people tune into the programmes. We may also invite you to interact with our Website by answering questions and selecting preferences as you move around the Website. We only use this data in an aggregated and non-personally identifiable way. The collected data helps us to determine our visitor's preferences, and to improve our Website so it is as appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible.

Like many companies, we use "cookie" technology on our Website. These cookies are small text-only strings that store information in the memory of your browser. There are several reasons we may use cookies:

Persistent Cookies. These cookies contain only a unique number, so when you log in they can tell us whether you've visited us before or if you are a new visitor. These cookies do not obtain any personal information about you or provide us with any way to contact you, and they do not extract any information from your computer. We do use cookies to help us identify site features in which you have the greatest interest, so that we can provide more of what you may want.

Session Cookies. These cookies are used to store information about your current visit to our site, such as if you have logged in successfully or if you have entered information into an electronic form. We use these cookies to personalise information and to help with on-line services. They can also provide us with a quick and convenient means of keeping site content fresh and relevant to your interests. Our server uses cookies to help with back-end interaction as well, which improves the utility of our site by being able to securely store any personal data that you have shared with us. These cookies are deleted the moment you close your browser window.

Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually refuse cookies, or selectively accept certain cookies, by adjusting the preferences in your browser. If you turn off cookies, there may be some features of our site that will not be available to you and some Web pages may not display properly.

We do not combine information collected through cookies with any personal information you tell us about yourself.

The only personal information we collect from you is information you choose to provide us about yourself.  
Some services and facilities on our Website we will require you to provide us with a certain minimum amount of personal information such as your name, postal address and email address in order that we can provide those services to you or to fulfill our obligations to you ("Required Information").  Typical examples where this arises include entering one of our competitions, prize draws or promotions, requesting a sample of our product or registering as a user on our Website.   
We may also ask you to provide additional information about yourself to assist in us contacting you or providing our services ("Voluntary Information"). We will make it clear what information is Required Information and what is Voluntary Information.

(b) How we use your personal information

We will use your personal information for the purpose it has been collected or any other purpose specified at the point of collection.  For example, we will retain and use your personal information for the purpose of administrating and notifying you of the results of any competitions or prize draws you have entered.

(e) Sharing your personal information

We will sometimes need to share your personal information with third parties who we contract to help us deliver services to you and to run and administer the Website and activities run through the Website such as competitions.  The information shared with them will be limited to that necessary for them to perform the service.  They will not be authorised to make any other use of that information and will treat it confidentially.

Except as described in the previous paragraph, we do not share your personal information with any third party which is not a subsidiary or parent company of Twinings other than: (i) where it is required by law; (ii) if you specifically authorised us to do so; or (iii) in the event that substantially all of the assets of Twinings are acquired by a third party in which case personal data held by it about its customers in its databases will be one of the transferred assets.

Age restrictions

In some instances, it may not be possible to register for our services or products if you are under a certain age determined by the laws of the country where you are resident.   In such cases we may ask you your age for the purpose of establishing your eligibility.

We do not intend to collect Personal Information relating to children through our website. Any person under the age of 16 who registers on our Website will be asked to provide a parent or guardian's e mail address where confirmation will be requested before any communication is made.

Transferring your information to other countries

If you are resident within the European Economic Area ("EEA") your Personal Information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and administered at, a destination outside the EEA which may have different levels of data protection law to the country from where you have submitted your personal information.  By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your Personal Information is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

OR

Overseas data transfers

If we transfer personal information to countries, or administer our services through countries whose data protection laws are not as extensive as those in the EEA, we will keep control of the information or require anyone we pass it to to treat it to appropriate standards.

We will ensure that personal information transferred outside the EEA is adequately protected.

Security

We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to prevent accidental or unlawful destruction or unauthorised disclosure, access or alteration to your personal information under our control. 

We will only store your data for as long as reasonably necessary in the circumstance, after which your personal information will be deleted from our systems.

However, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures to try to prevent unauthorised access.

Accessing your personal information

Subject to some exceptions, you have a right upon written request and payment of a fee of £10, to have a copy of any of your personal information we hold.
