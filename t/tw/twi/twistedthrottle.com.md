 **Using Information We Collect**

**Information We Share with Others**    
We contract with other companies to provide certain services, including credit card processing, shipping, and promotions management. We provide these companies with only the information they need to perform their services and work closely with them to ensure that your privacy is respected and protected. These companies are prohibited by contract from using this information for their own marketing purposes or from sharing this information with anyone other than Twisted Throttle LLC. 

On rare occasions, we may disclose specific information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, or when required by law to do so. We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes. 

Other than in the specific circumstances listed above, we do not distribute customer information to other companies for any reason. 

 **Your Choices**    
We offer choices about the types of information you receive from us.

If you no longer wish to receive our Email Newsletter you also may unsubscribe using the link provided in each edition of the email. 

Please be sure to provide us your exact name and address, or the mailing label from your catalog, so that we can be sure to identify you correctly. Because we plan our mailings in advance, it may take several weeks for your request to become effective. If, due to human error, you continue to receive our communications, please contact us again and we will make every effort to correct the situation.

It is our intent to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you. We use a variety of current technologies and processes for protection of our customer data. We limit the information we provide to outside companies with whom we contract to only what they need to carry out their responsibilities.
