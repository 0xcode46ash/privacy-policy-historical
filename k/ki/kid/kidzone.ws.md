We do not collect any personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address. However, we do obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information such as the Internet Service Provider people use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example). This helps us to determine what our pages will look like on your browser (in an attempt to make sure the templates and other images are viewable and printable for everyone). Just to be clear... this information is not specific -- we know that 30% of the people who visit use such and such a browser and 25% of the people who visit use Windows 95, etc... not that Jane uses Windows Explorer and Jimmy uses a MacIntosh.

In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in response to a specific request or email conversation (example, your name as a signature on an email). This is completely your choice and is not a requirement in corresponding with us.Â  If you do choose to correspond with us, we do not collect, sell or give any information to anyone for any purpose.
