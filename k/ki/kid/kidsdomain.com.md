# Kids Domain Privacy Policy

| 

##  PRIVACY STATEMENT

Hey Kids!  
Hey Parents! We at Kids Domain want everyone's visit here to be safe. This statement tells you how we do that. Specifically, we'll tell you what information we collect from visitors ("Visitors") to the Kidsdomain.com Web site (the "Site"), and how we use such information. If we make any changes to this statement they will be posted on this page and will be effective when posted. Your continued use of this Site following the posting of any change shows your acceptance of the changes. 

We are compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (Coppa). 

**KIDS NOTICE**

When using our Site you may be asked to provide your e-mail address and age to receive one of our newsletters or to enter a contest. If you give us your e-mail address for a newsletter and you are under the age of 13, we will also ask you for your parent or guardian's e-mail address, so we can let them know that you asked us for a newsletter. 

You may also be asked to create a screen name and password in order to participate in certain areas of the Site. If you are asked to create a screen name, please do not use your real name, try to think of something special and different. We will not use this information to contact you, only to make your access on the Site easier. 

We will also ask for your parent or guardian's e-mail address if you win a contest or sweepstakes, so we can send you your prize. 

Remember, always check with your parent or guardian when surfing the net! 

**PARENTS NOTICE**

It is important for you to talk with your child about using the Internet safely. Here are a few items to start the discussion, you may have a few of your own to add: 

  * Never give out your full name, address, or phone number without your parent's permission. 
  * If someone sends you something inappropriate, let your parents or teacher know. 
  * Never agree to meet someone you've been talking to on the net without your parent's permission. 
  * Treat others as you would like to be treated! 

   
We have a page of [safety information for families](http://www.kidsdomain.com/brain/computer/surfing/index.html) with additional information. **OUR GENERAL PRIVACY POLICY**

**I. INFORMATION COLLECTED**

We only collect personally identifiable information that is voluntarily submitted to us. We may request such information to, among other things, allow a Visitor to receive one of our newsletters or to enter a contest. When such information is requested, the Visitor will be told the purpose for such information. The Site will not require a Visitor to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity on the Site as a condition of such participation. 

As with most sites, certain non-personally identifiable information is recorded by the standard operation of our server. Such information may include: the name of the ISP from which a Visitor accesses the Internet, the date and time a Visitor accessed the Site, the Internet address of the Web site from which a Visitor entered our Site and where a Visitor goes after leaving this Site. This information is used to measure and monitor the use of our Site and to improve its content. Data which would personally identify a Visitor is known only when voluntarily submitted. 

**II. USE OF INFORMATION**

E-mail addresses that are submitted for entry in a contest or sweepstakes will only be used for the purpose of determining a winner. If a child under the age of 13 is selected as the winner, we will notify that child that he/she has won and request that they provide us with a parent or guardian e-mail address, so that we may award the prize. Also, if permission is granted by a parent of guardian, we may post the winner's first name and home state. Once the prize is awarded, only information related to the person who won the prize will be maintained for internal administrative purposes. 

Similarly, if a child wants to receive our newsletter, we will require a parent's e-mail address so that we may notify the parent or guardian of the child's request and allow the parent or guardian the opportunity to rescind that specific request. 

We may also use e-mail addresses for internal Site administration purposes, to respond to specific inquiries initiated by Visitors, and to comply with a law or legal action as directed by a court, regulatory agency or other entity acting with governmental authority. 

**III. COOKIES**

Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your computer which may be used to access information relating to your past use of the Site. This Site does not currently use "cookie" technology. However, we use an outside advertising company to display advertisements on our Site, which does use cookies. The ad company may receive and use cookies placed by certain ad banners displayed on our Site. We do not have access to information that would confirm the use of cookies by this advertising company. Most Internet browsers include preference settings that allow Visitors to be notified and control whether cookies are transferred to their computers. Please review your browser's documentation or "help" feature for more information on that functionality. 

**IV. SECURITY**

Our Site uses industry standard security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. While there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet, we will try our best to make sure that your transmissions to and from the Site are kept secure. 

**V. OTHER WEB SITES; LINKS**

The content of the Kids Domain Site is designed for family use. In addition to our own content, we also provide links to software publishers and sites children may be interested in. We do screen the other sites initially, but in the end, we cannot be responsible for what appears on other sites. We are also not responsible for the privacy policies of those other sites. 

**VI. ACCESS; CORRECT; UPDATE**

Because this Site does not maintain any personally identifiable information that would require ongoing review or updating by Visitors of the Site, there is nothing for Visitors to access, correct or update! 

**VII. CHOICE; OPT OUT**

Newsletters can be stopped at any point by visiting our Site at the links provided below and making such a request. In addition, if a child chooses to receive one of our newsletters, an e-mail will be sent to that child's parent or guardian offering the opportunity for that parent or guardian to stop delivery of the newsletter.
