##  PRIVACY POLICY 

Your child's privacy is important to us at Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. We are committed to safeguarding children's personal information collected online, and to helping parents and their children learn how to exercise control over personal information while exploring the Internet. The additional measures we have taken to help children protect their privacy while online include encouraging children to use non-personally identifiable screen names rather than their real names and taking efforts to prevent children from posting contact information. In addition, we do not ask children to disclose more personal information than is necessary for them to participate in an activity. 

To help ensure a rewarding online experience for your child, we provide you with this summary of our information practices. This privacy notice governs the collection and use of information at Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. Web sites directed to children. 

###  WE COLLECT LIMITED PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN 

At our sites, we have a policy of collecting limited personally identifiable information. To enable children to participate in some of our online activities, we may ask them to provide us with their first name, hometown, and e-mail address. 

On some pages of our sites, such as where children can send electronic postcards to their friends, we also may ask your child to provide personal information about other people. This is usually limited to a first name and e-mail address. To participate in certain features, we also may ask for the name and e-mail address of the child's parent to provide notice and obtain consent. 

When children visit our sites, we automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information such as the type of computer operating system (e.g., Windows '98 or Mac OS) and browser (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer) being used, and the domain name of the Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink). 

###  WE USE CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR INTERNAL PURPOSES 

We use children's information only for our internal purposes such as to enable them to subscribe to our online newsletter, to enter one of our sweepstakes or contests, to express their opinions on various topics, play games and to send electronic postcards or other content to their friends. 

We use the information that we collect about others to either enable the child to communicate with them, for example, to send an electronic greeting card to a friend, or to obtain your consent for participation in these activities, such as to notify you when your child has entered one of our contests or to allow you to approve registration on one of our sites. 

We use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize the experience at our sites. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer products, programs, or features. 

Sometimes, we use agents or contractors to provide services to our visitors, such as helping us conduct a contest or sweepstakes or sending prizes to winners. In these cases, we require the agent or contractor to keep the information confidential and to use it only for the specific services they are performing. 

We may disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our sites and applicable laws, or as otherwise required or permitted by law or consistent with legal requirements. In addition, we may transfer personally identifiable information if we or one of our business units are acquired by, sold to, or merged with another company. 

###  LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES 

Our site contains links to other sites whose information practices may be different than those at this site. Visitors should consult the privacy notice at the particular site to which they link to ascertain the practices there. 

###  COOKIES 

At some pages of our sites, we may use a software technology called "cookies." Cookies are small text files that we place in visitors' computer browsers to store their preferences. We use cookies to determine how many visitors we have and how often they visit various sections of our sites. 

We also may use "web beacons." Web beacons are small pieces of code placed on a web page to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page. For example, web beacons can be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page. We may use web beacons on our sites from time to time for this and other purposes. 

###  OUR COMMITMENT TO SECURITY 

We have put in place safeguards to help protect the personal information we collect online. 

###  REVIEWING YOUR CHILD'S INFORMATION/CONTACT US 

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding our privacy policy and/or practices or if you would like to review any personally identifiable information that we have collected online from your child, have this information deleted, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of your child's information, please contact us at the following e-mail address, address and telephone number:

###  NOTIFICATION REGARDING UPDATES 

From time to time, we may update this privacy notice. We will notify you about material changes in the way we treat personally identifiable information by placing a notice on our site. We encourage you to periodically check back to review this policy so that you always will know what information we collect, how we use it, and to whom we disclose it. 

###  A FINAL NOTE TO PARENTS 

The Internet offers a world of opportunity for children. Your guidance and involvement are essential to help ensure that children have a safe and rewarding online experience. Your efforts to instill responsible information practices will help steer your children to age-appropriate sites, and will go a long way toward ensuring that your children have enriching experiences online.
