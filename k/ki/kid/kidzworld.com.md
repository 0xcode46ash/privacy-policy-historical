Kidzworld has developed this policy statement to reflect our commitment to our users' privacy. 

**Children's Online Privacy Protection Act**

COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) became effective on April 21, 2000 . The regulations apply to the online collection of personal information from children 12 years and younger. The Act spells out what we, as website operators, must include in our privacy policy, when and how to seek verifiable consent from a parent and what responsibilities we, as website operators, have to protect and secure children's privacy and safety online.

COPPA applies to individual identifiable information about a child (12 or younger) that is collected online, such as full name, home address, email address, telephone number or any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact a child. The Act also applies to other types of information, such as hobbies, interests and user information gathered through the use of cookies and other methods of tracking, when they are tied to individually identifiable information.

Kidzworld is a tireless advocate of Internet privacy and embraces the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) **.** We take extraordinary measures to ensure and secure the privacy and safety of our users. 

**Kidzworld User Registration and Membership** ****

Our registration form requires users to give us contact information like their name, email address and demographic information (age, gender, general location and personal likes and dislikes). This information is used to get in touch with our members when necessary. For users over 13 years old, we are required to send their parent/guardian an email notifying them that they have registered at Kidzworld and provided us with personally identifiable information. For users 12 and under we obtain permission from their parent/guardian before they can be fully registered. We do this by sending them a confirmation email to which they must respond.

We do not disclose users' personal information to anyone, at any time, for any reason. Parents or guardians can review their child's personal information, once verifiable parental consent has been received by Kidzworld . Verifiable consent can be given by one of the following methods – following the link provided in the confirmation email sent to you, providing a signed form from a parent via postal mail or facsimile or even giving us a call. Upon request, a parent may delete or prohibit the further collection of their child's personal information by contacting us at privacy@kidzworld.com and clearly stating the nature of their inquiry. Any contact made with members will be through the facilities of Kidzworld .

Another way that Kidzworld accesses information about our users is through IP addresses. An IP address is something that is unique to your computer, and is used to identify and collect broad demographic information (like age, gender, regional information and generic interests).

Our site also uses a form for users to request information, products and services. We collect users' unique identifiers (like their Kidzworld on-screen name) to fulfill these requests.

Kidzworld hosts regular contests in which we ask visitors for contact information (like their e-mail address). This information is used strictly to contact entrants when necessary (like to let them know they have won). Contact information collected for contests is deleted once winners have been confirmed. You do not need to be a registered member to enter contests.

**The KW Zone – Social Networking at Kidzworld** ****

The KW Zone is the latest, and most exciting, component of the Kidzworld experience. The KW Zone allows users to create their own online profile where they can design backgrounds, upload pictures and videos, make friends and interact with other members with similar interests. All content on profile pages is strictly monitored, but members are still cautioned that anything they upload (and is subsequently approved) will then be viewable across the world wide web. We recommended that you only upload things that you are willing to share with everyone. 

**Chat Rooms and Bulletin Boards**

Kidzworld has chat rooms, message boards, discussion groups and forums. These are accessible to our registered users. Users should be aware that any posts and conversations in these areas becomes public information. You should NOT disclose any personally identifiable information. Your username is the only identity you should have, and that is how people should know you on the Internet. Kidzworld's chatroom and message boards are monitored at all times by experienced Kidzworld staff. Our chatroom is open from noon to 7:00PM Pacific Time (PST). Our chat moderators take extraordinary steps to ensure our users do not divulge personal information. Anyone who tries to reveal, or ask for, personal information will be removed from both the chat and message boards for 24 hours. If problems continue with the same user, their IP address could be permanently blocked and future access denied to the website from that IP address. 

**E-cards**

Kidzworld offers numerous e-cards for users to send to family and friends. To send an e-card, users must provide their email, their name, the recipient's email and the recipient's name. Information entered in the e-card is used solely for the purpose of sending the e-card. It is not stored or retained by Kidzworld. 

**Outbound Links** ****

Our site contains links to other sites. Although Kidzworld is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other sites, we screen all sites accessible from Kidzworld to ensure that they comply with our standards. When a user clicks on an outbound link, they are first directed to a page informing them that they are about to leave Kidzworld. 

**Email communications**

Kidzworld allows users to opt-out of receiving communications from us in the initial registration form. If a user wishes to opt-out after completing the registration form, they can do so by contacting us at privacy@kidzworld.com with the subject, “Cancel”. They can also unsubscribe by clicking on the Unsubscribe link in their next newsletter. 

**Third Party Advertising**

The ads appearing on Kidzworld are delivered to members by Burst Media, our Web advertising partner. Information about your visit to Kidzworld, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information), is used to control the delivery of ads to you on this site. 

**Third Party Cookies**

In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.

**Security**

Kidzworld has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Passwords and personal information is collected and stored on our secure servers. Paper records of data and financial transactions are stored in a locked facility. Information will only be divulged to law enforcement agencies upon subpoena.
