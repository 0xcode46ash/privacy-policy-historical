## Children's Online Privacy Protection Act

Kidzworld is a leading [**_safe social network for kids_**](https://web.archive.org/web/20131015081920id_/http%3A//www.kidzworld.com/corporate/safety). It was established in 2001, by Allen W. Achilles as a direct result of his concern for the online safety and security of his own children. Since that time, Allen Achilles has been a tireless advocate for the **safety and security of kids online**. COPPA (Childrenís Online Privacy Protection Act) became effective on April 21, 2000. The regulations apply to the online collection of personal information from children in the US who are 12 years and younger. The Act spells out what website operators, need to include in their privacy policy, when and how to seek verifiable consent from a parent and what responsibilities website operators have to protect and secure childrenís privacy and safety online.

COPPA applies to individual identifiable information about a child (12 or younger) that is collected online, such as full name, home address, email address, telephone number or any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact a kid. The Act also applies to other types of information, such as hobbies, interests and user information gathered through the use of cookies and other methods of tracking, when they are tied to individually identifiable information. 

Kidzworld and founder Allen Achilles are tireless advocates of Internet safety and privacy. As the only **_[fully moderated kids social network](https://web.archive.org/kwzone)_** , we take extraordinary measures to ensure and secure the privacy and safety of our kids.

## Kidzworld User Registration and Membership

Registration requires users to create an anonymous identity that does not include their full name. They provide limited contact information: first name, last initial, email address, age, gender, and country, state/province. The email address is only used to contact users to confirm their registration and at other times when necessary. For users 12 and under we only collect their date of birth, location, gender and parent/guardians email address. **Parent/guardian** receives a confirmation email to which they must respond in order to activate the childís account. Parent email addresses are retained in our database for future contact. Accounts not activated within 21 days are deleted in their entirety from our database. Under no circumstances do we market products or offerings from third parties to our users by email. 

We do not disclose the users personal information to anyone, at any time except by subpoena from authorities. However, in the event of the sale or merger of the company; Kidzworld.com, Inc., the personal information collected by Kidzworld about itsí user in the normal course of its business will be shared with the partner company or successor company upon completion of the subject acquisition or merger. Parents or guardians can review their childís personal information once we receive verifiable identification. Verifiable consent can be given by one of the following methods: following the link provided in the confirmation email, provide a signed form via postal mail or facsimile or even giving us a call. Upon request, parents may delete or prohibit the further collection of their child's personal information by contacting us at **privacy@kidzworld.com**.

Another way that **Kidzworld** accesses information about users is through IP addresses. An IP address is unique to the userís computer, and is used to identify and collect broad demographic information (like age, gender, regional information and generic interests). As a safe social network for kids, tools such as these can be used positively and in the interest of protecting the privacy and safety of all kids online.

Kidzworld also employs a **HELP form** for kids to request information, products and services. We collect kidís unique identifiers (their Kidzworld on-screen name) to fulfill these requests, however, the information is not retained. 

Kidzworld hosts regular contests in which we ask kids for contact information (like their e-mail address). This information is solely used to contact winners. Contact information collected for contests is deleted once winners have been confirmed. Participation in contests is open to all kids, registered or not.

## E-cards

Thus, it can readily be assumed that they already know this person in real life. They must, by law also include their own email address and their name.
