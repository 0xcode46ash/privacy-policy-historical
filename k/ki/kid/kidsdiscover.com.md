# Privacy Policy - Kids Discover

_Before you read our full privacy policy below, we’d like to share a couple thoughts about how we view, protect, and make all efforts to ensure your privacy as it pertains to Kids Discover products and services._

_Our worlds, and our lives, are increasingly connected with the Internet. For better or for worse, this means that more and more of our information is available online. The importance of keeping your personal information secure, and private, has never been more important. That’s why Kids Discover makes an effort to keep the amount of data we collect on users to a minimum, and why we make enormous efforts to protect and secure the data we do collect. We encourage our users to read our full privacy policy below, but we do want to highlight a couple crucial points about our privacy policy:_

_• We do not rent or sell any personal information we collect from our users to any 3rd parties._  
_• We do not sell any advertising on any of our products, and so the personal information you share with Kids Discover is never used for 3rd party marketing services._  
_• The only information we collect from students is first name, last name, username, and password. We do not except any email addresses of individuals under the age of 18 years old._  
_• The personal information that we collect from adults is used for account registration, account-related access, and internal marketing efforts made directly from Kids Discover to our user base, such as email marketing._

_Additionally, we have signed the K-12 School Service Provider Pledge to Safeguard Student Privacy. You can learn more about the pledge[here](http://studentprivacypledge.org/)._

_If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please feel free to email us at[questions@kidsdiscover.com](mailto:questions@kidsdiscover.com). We’d be more than happy to answer your questions, concerns, or help clarify the privacy policy below._

Sincerely,

**Ted Levine**

## PRIVACY POLICY

### INTRODUCTION

The privacy of those who use this website, app, or any other extensions of Kids Discover’s products or services is very important to us. As a family-owned and operated company, you can be certain that we approach your personal privacy and the data of our user base with the utmost care and security. If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please feel free to email us at [questions@kidsdiscover.com](mailto:questions@kidsdiscover.com).

We are fully compliant with the FTC’s Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). To learn more about COPPA, click here. Additionally, we support the goals and guidelines set forth the Children’s Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus. You’ll notice that there is no advertising on, or in, any of our products, apps or websites. We do not believe in advertising to children. We also support districts and schools that are subject to compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).

**A note to minors:** If you are under the age of 13, please get permission from your parent/legal guardian before using this website or app or sending any e-mail to us. You must be 18 or older to order a subscription to Kids Discover Online. We will not sell or market directly to minors and always seek parental or legal guardian’s authorization whenever we identify that a minor attempts to purchase a Kids Discover product or service.

**A note to schools and districts:** Whenever we collect student identifiable information, we do so in support of the educational purposes for which Kids Discover Online is designed. Such information is only collected in conjunction with the use of Kids Discover Online (for account registration, account access, and Lexile ® Leveled Reading designations), an optional feature that only schools and districts can access.

### DEFINITIONS

The following definitions, which describe how we characterize user’s information apply to this policy:

“Personally Identifiable Information” or “PII” is information that can identify a user of this website, including e-mail, name and address. “Anonymous Information” is information that does not enable identification of an individual user. “De-Identified Information” is information from which all personally identifiable components have been removed. Unlike Anonymous Information, De-Identified information is initially collected as Personally Identifiable Information, after which we remove any identifying component to make the information anonymous.

### WHAT TYPE OF INFORMATION DO WE COLLEGE AND WHY:

**Information collected when subscribing:** In the registration process of any of our subscription types, we ask our subscriber to provide us with name, email address, affiliation with a school or district (if applicable), phone number and billing information. We use this contact information to send users service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary or advisable to do so. For instance, if we perform routine maintenance, we might send an informational email.

**Username and password:** Subscribers create a username and password in the registration process, or, if they prefer, we may assign these for them. We use usernames and passwords of subscribers’ accounts to authenticate logins, allow access to the paid content and monitor subscription compliance. The username is also used to authenticate users when requesting technical support. The passwords are all encrypted when stored.

**Information collected automatically:** We automatically receive and record information on our server logs from a user’s browser, including the user’s IP address. In addition, we use IP addresses to maintain a user’s session and we do not store them after the user’s session is over. We also do not otherwise combine this information with other PII.

We also use a standard feature found in browser software, called a “cookie”, in order to establish and authenticate user session, enable access to paid content and monitor potential misuse of the accounts. We do not use cookies to collect Personally Identifiable Information nor do we combine such general information with other PII to identify a user. Disabling our cookies will prevent access to paid content and limit some of the features and functionalities of the website or app. To learn more about browser cookies, including how to manage or delete them, look in the Tools, Help or similar section of your Web browser, or visit allaboutcookies.org.

**Third Parties:** We may use a variety of third-party service providers, such as analytics companies, to understand usage of our services. We may allow those providers to place and read their own cookies, electronic images known as web beacons or single-pixel gifs and similar technologies, to help us measure how users interact with our services. This technical information is collected directly and automatically by these third parties. If you want to opt out or third party cookies, you may do so through your browser.

**Information collected when using Kids Discover Online:** As part of certain subscriptions, schools and districts will use the individual accounts system which allows students and their teachers to share a virtual classroom. Student and teacher accounts are organized by classrooms, which are created by the teachers. For these accounts, we ask the students to enter their first and last name, their username, and the class they are associated with. We also require the teachers’ email for password recovery. The only Personally Identifiable Information collected about students is their name, class and username. We do NOT collect students’ emails or addresses. We store the Lexile ® Reading Level data that may be set by a teacher, so that our content may be served up dynamically to a reader. This data is not shared, tracked, or analyzed by Kids Discover, nor is it rented, sold, or used by any third party service providers. It is saved in our system to deliver a more optimal reading experience for the students and teachers using the service. It is not used in any other way.

**Contact information for newsletter and surveys:** On KidsDiscover.com and Kids Discover Online, you may choose to register to receive newsletters, promotional offerings or surveys, which requires your contact information. Such messages may include pixel tags and link tracking. The contact information you submit will not be shared, sold or used for any other purpose and you may opt out at any time. Registration to newsletters, promotional offering and surveys are not intended for minors under the age of 13.

**Emails received from users:** We may retain certain information from users when they send us messages through our system or by email. We only use such information for providing the services or support requested.

**Feedback:** Certain features we offer include an option to provide us with feedback on your experience. The feedback feature does not identify the user submitting it. The feedback option is voluntary and the information a user submits to us will only be used for improving these features. If we receive personally identifiable information through a feedback form we take steps to immediately delete that information.

### FERPA COMPLIANCE

We understand the obligation educational agencies, districts and school systems have to comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and we support schools in their compliance efforts and facilitate their alignment with FERPA.

Under the terms of our contracts with schools, we agree to act as a “School Official” as defined by FERPA, meaning that we:  
• Perform an institutional service or function for which the school or district would otherwise use its own employees;  
• Have been determined to meet the criteria set forth in the school’s or district’s annual notification of FERPA rights for being a School Official with a legitimate educational interest in the education records;  
• Are under the direct control of the school or district with regard to the use and maintenance of education records.

### HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION

We may provide Personally Identifiable Information to our partners, business affiliates and third party service providers who work for Kids Discover and operate some of its functionalities, such as hosting services, streaming services and credit card processing. These third parties are well-known, established service providers, who are bound contractually to practice adequate security measures and only use your information for the sole purpose of providing the services. These third parties do not have independent right to share your Personally Identifiable Information. We share Anonymous Information or De-Identified Information about our users for tracking analytical information when using third party web analytical tools. We may use or share Anonymous Information or De-Identified Information for educational research purposes, to evaluate the educational benefit of using our services or to improve our services.

We will NOT share any information for marketing or advertising purposes.

We reserve the right to disclose Personally Identifiable Information if we are required to do so by law or if we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process.

We also reserve the right to transfer your Personally Identifiable Information in case of a corporate restructuring (such as a merger or acquisition), as long as the receiving entity adopts this privacy policy that applies to your information. Any future successors must pledge their commitment to the K-12 School Service Provider Pledge that we have signed and agreed to cooperate with.

### HOW WE STORE AND PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION

We strive to maintain security policies and procedures that are designed to protect your information.

Our servers are located in a secured, locked and monitored environment to prevent unauthorized entry or theft, and are protected by a firewall. The servers are located in a data center in the United States and backed up daily to a secure, US based, offsite data center.

We take extra measures to ensure the safety of PII and Student Records and apply a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL or HTTPS) encrypting technology to establish and ensure that all data passed between the server and the browser remains encrypted.

Governance policies and access controls are in place to ensure that the information of each district or school or other subscriber is separated and they are only able to access their own data.

Only limited Kids Discover personnel have access to the database, and they only access the database when necessary to provide services.

We follow standardized and documented procedures for coding, configuration management, patch installation and change management for all applicable servers and we audit our practices at least once a year.

While we strive to maintain best industry-standard privacy and security practices, it should be noted that no industry system is fail proof. In the event we learn of an actual data breach, loss or disaster, we have established a Disaster Recovery Plan, which includes notifying the affected subscriber, and as appropriate, coordinating with the subscriber to support its notification of affected individuals, students and families when there is a substantial risk of harm from the breach or a legal duty to provide notification.
