# Kiddicare - Security and Privacy | Online baby shop | Nursery Equipment

When you register details with us, make an order or access account details, we use a secure server. Any data you give us is encrypted using a 'Secure Socket Layer' (SSL) session. SSL is an industry standard and is one of the best ways to ensure Internet messages are not intercepted. 

When using a secure connection a small padlock will be displayed in the bottom right hand corner of your browser when you reach our checkout page.

**Verified by Visa and MasterCard Secure - Fraud Protection**

In addition to our secure website we were also the first to implement the Visa and MasterCard anti fraud protections schemes in our industry. If your credit card issuer participates in the scheme you will be asked for your online password to verify your transaction.

If you have yet to register for this scheme don't worry your card issuer will either ask you to register during our checkout process or in another future transaction.
