KIDDICARE.COM LIMITED PRIVACY POLICY

You should know what information about you we collect and how we use it. 

This issue is very important to us, so we have set out full details in this policy. 

Please take the time to read this policy in full and understand it. By using our websites and mobile apps, contacting us by telephone or otherwise providing information to us (for example through our stores or social media), you agree to its terms.

To be helpful, we’ve included some links to other websites in this policy. Please note that these websites are controlled by other people, not us, and we are not responsible for them.

**WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND WHEN?**

We only collect information that we will genuinely use for the purposes set out in this policy. 

Specifically, we collect:

  * All information you choose to submit to us. You can choose to submit information to us through a lot of different ways:
  * Through forms, for example in signing up to an offers, news or a competition;
  * By sending us emails and text messages (SMS or MMS);
  * By adding posts, reviews and other comments to any of our websites, apps or other community forums;
  * By interacting with us on social media platforms (such as Facebook or Twitter);
  * By speaking to us in our stores or over the telephone, for example in making an enquiry about a purchase you have made or a complaint; or
  * By registering accounts on any of our websites or mobile apps including setting up passwords and preferred user names, contact details, account details, details of friends and relatives, your preferences and interests. (Please note: If you submit details to us of any other person (e.g. a friend) please make sure you have their permission before doing so.)
  * ‘Sensitive’ information on you, but far less frequently than the above information. ‘Sensitive’ information includes your racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs or other beliefs of a similar nature and your physical condition (e.g. if you are pregnant). Most of this information will be submitted by you to us via forms so you have the choice as to whether to provide this information, however we may also obtain it though social media or through our analysis of your preferences and behaviours (see below).
  * Full details of the purchases you make on our websites, through our mobile apps or in our stores, including the time and date of purchase, the goods you purchase from us, any relevant delivery address and details of any relevant payment card (such as a credit or debit card) you use.
  * Information on what you view, click on and access in and through our marketing emails and text messages (SMS or MMS), websites and mobile apps. We also collect this information when you use our in-store WIFI networks to access the internet. We may collect the time and geographic location of your device when you do so. For websites, this information may also include where you came to our site from, and where you went when you left it. We also track how often you visit and use our websites and mobile apps. We do this through the use of email and website cookies and similar tracking technology built into our mobile apps. We make cookie policies available on each of our websites to give you more detailed information on how we use them. The cookie policy for this website is set out [here](https://web.archive.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/securityandprivacy0_10751__-1_10001)
  * Technical information about the devices you use to access our websites and on which you use our mobile apps. We also collect this information when you use our in-store WIFI networks to access the internet. We collect each device’s unique identifying codes (e.g. its “MAC” address), relevant IP address, operating system and version, web browser and version, and geographic location. 
  * Your social media content where this is in the public domain, and any messages you send direct to us via social media. This information can include posts and comments, pictures and video footage. You should review the terms and conditions and privacy policies of the social media that you use to ensure you understand what information relating to you may be placed in the public domain and how you can stop or limit it from happening. 
  * Basic background information on you available from government sources. For example, we check our customer information against the electoral roll to make sure it remains reasonably accurate and to fill in any basic gaps. 
  * Information from banking, credit card and credit reference agencies about your financial status and the status of any payment card presented to us (e.g. if it has been reported stolen) to check we are likely to be paid for any transaction, and to reduce the risk of fraud (see below);
  * Profile information and insight from companies who already have information on you, such as credit reference agencies (“customer insight companies”). They give us their views on what your household may look like, your status, likely preferences and behaviours. 



This information includes the likely makeup of your household (e.g how many children you may have and their likely average age) and what your household affairs may be like, the type of car you may have, your interests (including what magazines and newspapers you may read, your holidays and whether you are environmentally conscious or not) and where you may currently shop. It includes observations about your likely education and employment status, the type of job you may have and your likely financial status (including your mobile phone expenditure, what credit, debit and other cards you may hold, your current account status and the extent of any loans, investments and savings you may have). 

It also places you into one or more defined behavioural and socio-economic groups.

  * Information collected independently by online advertising networks (for example Google) through whom we place advertisements. The information we obtain varies from network to network. It often summaries the actions of lots of people, and so does not enable us to identify you individually. It relates to what you view, click on, and access through websites in their network, including the subject matter of the site you started at and where you subsequently go. It may also include their analysis of your behaviour across the wider internet and a profile of you. If you are unhappy about this happening you should look out for “settings” and Do Not Track options in online advertisements and in the privacy and cookies functionality on your devices and consider changing your settings to block third party cookies in particular. We do not control the information on you that such networks obtain, or the technology they use to do so. 



**HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?**

We use the information we collect for many different things: 

  * To provide you with our websites, mobile apps and in-store WIFI networks, which require a certain amount of technical information to be collected in order to work properly. For example, our local store finder works most effectively when we can tell where you are. 
  * To power security measures and related services relating to your access to our website and mobile apps for example to enable us to recognise your username and password, but also reset those if you forget them; 
  * To enable you to buy things from us both in store and over the internet, which again requires a certain amount of information to be collected, for example your payment card details so we can take payment and the things in your basket so we can provide you with a receipt;
  * To enable us to run competitions and offers for which you have signed up, about which we need to be able to communicate with you;
  * To gather feedback from you about our products, websites, mobile apps, other services and activities from time to time. We may invite you to provide this feedback on occassion, for example by emailing you to ask you if you would like to review a product you have bought or a service you have used. We may use independent research and feedback providers to do so on our behalf. 
  * To contact you from time to time about things you have told us you want to hear about, for example our products, news, offers, new competitions and sponsored events; 
  * To respond to any questions, suggestions, issues or complaints you have raised with us;
  * To respond to any social media posts or other public comments you make where these are made directly to or about us, our products, websites, mobile apps, services or other activities;
  * To communicate with you about operational changes to our products, services, websites and mobile apps, for example if we were to withdraw one of our apps, or change this privacy policy;
  * To perform any contract we have entered into with you but also to enforce a contract against you if you do not honour it, including in seeking to collect any debts that we may be owed;
  * To gather statistics about how you and other people use our website and mobile apps, in-store WIFI networks and what you think of our adverts, offers, news, product information, competitions, sponsored events, social media and other digital content. We then analyse these statistics to understand if these things appear interesting and meet most people’s needs, or if they should be improved, and if so, what design or other changes (e.g. around the nature and timing of communications) would be most beneficial both for our customers, and for our business. 
  * To check that you have or are likely to have the means to pay us for any products you have ordered from us over the internet or one of our mobile apps;
  * To monitor use of our websites and mobile apps to see if they are being abused or threatened for example by people posting inappropriate comments in review areas or by potential hackers looking to undermine their security;
  * To protect you and our business against any other potential criminal behaviour, including potential identity theft and fraud;
  * To understand you better and in particular, your habits, where you are from time to time, your personal circumstances and those of your family or household, and the things you may like, dislike, and be interested in. 



Our aim is to excite you as much as possible and provide great service and value to you in everything we do. 

By having really good information about you, we can focus on the things we think are most likely to be of real interest to you in everything we do, and especially when we send you offers, news, information on our products and details of new competitions and sponsored events, or present you with adverts and content online. 

We can then, for example, provide you with money-off vouchers and rewards for the things you actually buy from us, and for the things we think you might be most interested in buying from us in the future. We can also tailor these to your precise location, for example if there is a promotion at a store local to you we think you may be interested in.

  * To maintain administrative and statutory records about our business to enable us to understand what we have sold, how, when, where and at what price and account to the tax authorities for the related taxes that we have to pay;
  * To enable us and our third party service providers to plan and manage our day-to-day business and related services as effectively as possible, for example in predicting likely sales volumes of any one product, so we can try and make sure we have enough stock to meet likely demand;
  * To enable us to understand what our customer and user base looks like across all our businesses both online and in the “real world” and from our smallest store to our largest supermarket. We do this by combining your information with information about our other customers and users of our websites, mobile apps and in-store WIFI networks, so we can spot trends and common factors amongst everyone. We can then further tailor our business approach and in particular our marketing communications, use of digital media, products and services to the things we think you and other people like you would be most interested in. This process involves analysis of many human traits and is sometime called “market segmentation” or “customer segmentation”. We look at common trends or “segments” based on people’s geographic location, behaviours, shopping experience, financial standing, things they do on special occasions and the benefits they look for from products, amongst other things.
  * To enable us to conduct focussed market research based on those trends and factors, which we can then use to further improve our products and services for all of our customers; 
  * In the process of anonymising your information so that you are no longer identifiable to us;
  * To test new systems and processes as we roll them out (but generally only in anonymous form) to make sure they work and will meet the high expectations we set for ourselves; 
  * To assist us in the development of new products and services over time, for example to gauge whether a new product is likely to be appealing to a large proportion of our customer base or not; and
  * To analyse whether the money we spend on marketing advertising, on TV, billboards, online and in search engines represents good value for us or not. 



We do so in part by matching information common to the various different sources of information we have about you, to build a bigger, richer picture. So for example, if you sign up to a competition and provide your email address, and then register for an online account with us using the same email address, we link those two pieces of information together. We can achieve the same effect through matching transaction details and technical information about the electronic devices you use as well. By doing so, we can understand you better and provide a better experience to you, as we set out above. 

**WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH?**

We cannot run our business or provide many of the services and benefits you expect to receive without involving other people and businesses, and sometimes we pass your information to these other people and businesses as set out below. 

We only share your information where we can do so in accordance with our legal data protection and privacy obligations.

We share the information we collect with:

  * all of the Morrisons’ group companies, brands and business units that have relationships with our customers and users, for example, between Kiddicare and Morrisons, between our online business at Kiddicare.com, MorrisonsCellar and Morrisons.com, and between our store-based businesses. We do so because we hope to have a relationship with you across all of these different brands and businesses, if not now, then in the future, and we want to be able to provide you with the same value and high quality of experience wherever you choose to interact with us;
  * other people and businesses who help us provide our websites, mobile apps, in-store WIFI networks, stores and related services to you, for example, information technology companies who design and host our websites, and payment services companies who enable you to use credit or payment cards with us;
  * our insurers and insurance brokers where required in order for us to be able to obtain insurance against risks we face in running our business;
  * banks and finance companies where we have allowed them to offer you the possibility of purchasing products on credit or through a loan arranged through our stores or on online.
  * credit reference agencies who provide anti-fraud and credit-insight information to us, central and local government departments, for example the Driver Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and local authorities who run the UK electoral rolls, banks and finance companies who also provide anti-fraud services, and customer insight companies (as set out above) in each case as necessary in order to benefit from their services;
  * Rewards companies which you have signed up to, in order for you to receive the rewards and benefits they offer when you shop with us;
  * any new business partners we may have over time, for example a joint venture, reorganisation, business merger or sale affecting us.
  * our professional advisors for example our lawyers and technology consultants when they need it to provide advice to us
  * the Police, local authorities, Her Majesties Revenue and Customs (HMRC) the Courts and any other central or local government bodies where they request it and we may lawfully disclose it, for example for the prevention and detection of crime.
  * other people who make a subject access request to us, where we are allowed to do so by law (see “Managing Your Information” below for what we mean by a “subject access request”).



We also may share the information we collect where we are legally obliged to do so, for example e.g. to comply with a court order.

Social media, blogs, reviews, and similar services

Any social media posts or comments you make to us will be shared under the terms of the relevant social media platform (e.g. Facebook or Twitter) on which they are made and could be made public by that platform. These platforms are controlled by other people, not us, so we are not responsible for this sharing. You should review the terms and conditions and privacy policies of the social media platforms you use to ensure you understand how they will use your information, what information relating to you they will place in the public domain and how you can stop them from doing so if you are unhappy about it.

Any blog, review or other posts or comments you make about us, our products and services on any of our blog, review or user community services will be shared with all other members of that service and the public at large. 

You should ensure any comments you make on these services, and on social media in general are fit to be read by the public, and in particular are not offensive, insulting or defamatory. You are responsible for ensuring that any comments you make comply with any relevant policy on acceptable use of those services. 

**SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION**

Much of the information we receive is provided electronically, originating with your relevant device and then transmitted to us by your relevant telecoms network provider. 

Where it is within our control, we put measures in place to ensure this “in flight” data is reasonably secure.

Once your information is received by us, we take its security very seriously. 

We use appropriate procedures and technical security measures (including strict encryption, anonymisation and archiving techniques) to safeguard your information across all our computer systems, networks, websites, mobile apps, offices and stores as much as possible. 

In particular, we follow an internationally recognised security standard known as “ISO 27001”, and the Payment Card Industry’s Data Security standards (otherwise known as “PCI-DSS”). 

We also use secure means to communicate with you where appropriate, such as ‘‘https’’ and other security and encryption protocols.

If you have any concerns about the security of your own personal computers and mobile devices, we suggest you read the advice of Get Safe Online, which can be accessed [here.](http://www.getsafeonline.org/)

**INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER OF YOUR INFORMATION**

Although we are a business based in the UK, we need to use suppliers who are of an international standing on occasion to help ensure you receive the very best in products and services from us. 

To allow us to run our business on this basis, the information we collect may be transferred to, stored and used at premises in countries around the world, including the United States of America. 

We ensure all our suppliers take security as seriously as we do though, including by encouraging adoption of the US Department of Commerce’s ‘Safe Harbor’ standards by our American suppliers. 

Please note that information protection laws do vary from country to country. In particular, the law of the country in which you are resident or domiciled may offer a higher standard of protection than the laws in the United Kingdom and/or those other countries in which we store and use the information we collect. Our transfer of information to other countries could result in that information being available to government and other authorities in those countries under their laws. 

By using our services you agree to this international transfer, storing and processing.

**HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION FOR**

In accordance with the our legal data protection and privacy obligations, we will only retain your information for as long as we actually need it to achieve the purpose(s) for which we obtained it in the first place. 

We will then either securely delete it or anonymise it so that it cannot be linked back to you. 

See ‘How do we use your information?’ above for full details of those purposes. 

**MANAGING YOUR INFORMATION**

You can contact us to discuss your information at any point in time using the details provided below. 

It is very important to us that all the information we hold about you remains accurate and up-to-date at all times to reduce the chances of us having a misunderstanding. We try hard to make sure this is the case at all times regardless of what information we hold about you. 

We need your help in doing so though. If you have any online account with us, please ensure that the information you provide to us through that account (e.g. any contact information you provide) remains accurate and up-to-date. Please review and update it regularly.

You have a number of rights which we respect and aim to uphold in all that we do. These rights include:

  1. Correcting inaccurate information. If you have reason to believe any of the information we collect on you may be inaccurate, and you cannot correct such inaccuracy yourself through your registered accounts with us, please contact us (see below for how to do this). 
  2. Stopping our marketing. We provide the means for you to stop all email and test (SMS or MMS) communications you receive from us – please see the ‘unsubscribe’ link and ‘STOP’ details we include in each email and text respectively. We also check all our post and telephone marketing activity against the UK mail and telephone preference services, so you can register with these services as one way of stopping any such communications from us. You can also contact us at any time using the details below and let us know what you would like us to change.
  3. Asking us about your information. You have the right to ask us whether we hold information about you and if so, for us to give you certain details about that information and/or the information itself. This right is commonly known as a ‘subject access request’. Certain exemptions and conditions apply to this right, including that it should be in writing and that you give us reasonable details about the information you seek.
  4. Reviewing our use of automatic computer processing. You can ask us to have one of our staff review a decision about you which has been taken automatically by computer. One common example is if we decline an order you place with us online or through one of our mobile apps for anti-fraud or credit check reasons. Please note that these decisions can come about due to policy decisions taken by banks, card and payment processing companies, and credit reference agencies who separately hold information about you and to resolve them you may have to speak to them directly.



Depending on your country of residence or domicile, you may have other legal rights over the information we collect from you and your devices (e.g. to request a copy of the information we hold that relates to you). We will honour all such legal rights. 

We reserve the right to charge you a small administration fee to meet our costs in honouring your legal rights, where permitted by the relevant law. 

We reserve the right not to comply with any requests we receive where we may lawfully do so, for example if we reasonably believe a request to be malicious, technically very onerous, to involve disproportionate effort or harmful to the rights of others.

If you have any complaints about our use of your information, please contact us. We will do our very best to resolve any complaint to your satisfaction. If, for whatever reason, you feel we do not meet the high standards we expect of ourselves, you have a right to complain to the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (or “ICO”). Please see the section “Where to go if you want more information about your privacy rights” for further details. 

Please don’t forget that with modern technology you increasingly have personal control over what information we and other organisations collect. For example, you can delete cookies and tracking technologies stored on your own device through your web browser, and change related settings to restrict them going forward, for example by using private browsing modes (although this can affect your browsing experience on some websites). You can also use the settings options in your mobile devices to restrict what information websites and mobile apps can access and use about you. Online advertising networks, social media platforms and search engines (for example Google) also increasingly provide you with tools to manage the data they collect about you, how it is used and shared. We encourage you to proactively look for such functions and tools and use them to manage your privacy in a manner with which you are happy. 

**UPDATES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

We review our use of your information regularly. In doing so, we may change what we collect, how we keep it and what we will do with it. 

As a result, we will need to change this policy from time to time to keep it accurate and up to date. 

If we change this policy, we will endeavour to tell you about it. That way you can check to see if you are happy with our policy, before proceeding any further. Please look out for notices from us. 

If, following any changes, you continue to use our websites and mobile apps, contact us by telephone or otherwise provide information to us (for example through our stores or social media) we will take it that you agree to those changes. 

**CCTV INFORMATION.**

We have CCTV in operation at all of our stores.

All CCTV footage is captured purely for your security and for the prevention and detection of crime. It is kept separate from all of the other information we collect about you (as set out above). For further details, please see our in-store signage, or contact us using the details provided below.

Updates to this cookie policy

**An introduction to all things cookie!**

(Sadly we are talking about information technology not biscuits!)

Modern websites are powered by lots of bits of computer technology, many of which involve other computers effectively 'talking' on a regular basis to your computer or mobile phone as you use the internet. Cookies are just one of these technologies. 

A ' **cookie** ' is technically a very short piece of computer code that can be loaded (or 'set') onto your computer or mobile phone when you access or do something on a web page. Once set, it can be accessed by that website, and potentially some other computers from time to time. It's not harmful to your computer or mobile phone like a virus or other malicious code.

Cookies are used for lots of different purposes. For example, they can power shopping baskets, help keep you secure, allow pre-population of forms, and enable a website provider like us to understand how their website is used. They are also used to drive online advertising that is relevant to you by building up a picture of what you are interested in from your use of the internet.

Cookies have a lifetime. Many only last until you close your browser or for a short time. These are called ' **session cookies** '. 

Some last far longer though, for example, to enable a website to recognise you when you return to them. These are called ' **persistent cookies** '. Where possible, we’ll let you know how long these cookies last for.

Cookies set directly by a website owner (like us) are generally known as ' **first party cookies** '. Many (if not most) modern websites also use bits of hidden technology provided by other people though. Online advertising is a particularly common example. These other people may also set cookies when you use a website. If they do so, their cookies are generally known as ' **third party cookies** '.

There are some other computer technologies which are technically different to cookies but are used to perform very similar jobs and function in a very similar way. For example, ' **locally stored objects** ' (or 'flash cookies') are used to power some online video content, and ' **web bugs** ' (or 'web beacons') are used for many of the same purposes as cookies. If you want to know more, we suggest you read [this site](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). **(Please note that we are not responsible for other people's sites though)**.

Now that we've explained what cookies are, please read 'How do we use cookies' to understand how we use them and similar technologies.

 **How do we use cookies?**

We have set out brief details of the cookies and similar technologies we use below, together with an overview of why we use them. 

All the cookies we use are session cookies unless we say they are persistent cookies in the table below.

We set different cookies at different times during your experience; depending on the cookies it may be when you visit our home page, another page, on our community pages or at secure check out.

Occasionally we will reward other websites for referring you to us. Each individual advertiser uses its own tracking cookies. Examples of these advertisers including Google, Digital Window and Shopzilla.

*See 'An introduction to all things cookie' for what these terms mean.

**You Tube**. Where we use YouTube videos on our YouTube, use cookies to capture and analyse visitor information related to video usage such as videos viewed and shared.

**Social media**. We love it when you share information from our website through a social media network such as Facebook or Twitter, but when you do so, please be aware that your social network may set additional cookies and similar technologies on your computer or mobile phone. We're not responsible for these other cookies and technologies. Please check the privacy and cookie policies of the social media networks you use for full details of what they do.

We regularly review the cookies we and our suppliers use to keep them to the minimum we think we need. In doing so, we aim to respect your right to privacy in your online life, which is very important to us, but also ensure you have a good browsing experience and ensure we have enough of, and the right kind of information to improve our website and business.

It is not easy to strike the right balance though, and we recognise that you might disagree with us (although we hope you don't). 

For this reason, we have provided details of how you can manage cookies yourself (See 'How can you manage cookies?'). By following the instructions set out, you can tailor how your web browser behaves to ensure only cookies and similar technologies with which you are happy are loaded onto your computer, mobile phone or tablet device.

**How can you manage cookies?**

Some providers of third party cookies give you the means to opt-out of the services they provide (for example, targeted advertising). Where we are aware of our suppliers doing so, we have provided details in our 'How do we use cookies' tab. These providers may use cookies to power their opt-out service, so if you choose to block cookies using the means set out below, their opt-out service may cease to work, and the adverts you sought to block may reappear. 

The main way to manage all cookies and similar technologies that are set on your computer or mobile phone is through adjusting your web browser settings. In practice, this process will result in some or all of them being blocked.

You'll need to consult your browser's user guide to see how you can use it to restrict or block cookies and similar technologies. Some browsers are more sophisticated than others in managing these technologies, so if you want greater controls, it would be worth comparing a few of them.

 **What will happen if you choose to restrict or block cookies?**

If you choose to restrict or block cookies and similar technologies on your computer and/or mobile phone on average your browsing experience will change.

The extent of the changes will differ from website to website, depending on how they use cookies and similar technologies. Some websites may be completely unaffected, but you may see great changes to others. Your browsing experience may become less interactive, less personal to you, contain more error messages, and certain websites may not work at all, or at least not as you have come to expect. For example, you may see fewer adverts, but you may not be able to buy as many things online because website shopping baskets are normally powered by cookies.

Our website is designed to use cookies, so it may be affected by some or all of the issues set out above, as well as others not listed here. In particular, your shopping experience on our website will be limited to browsing and research, and you won't be able to add products to your basket or buy them.

**Updates to this cookie policy**

We review our use of cookies and similar technologies regularly (see our 'How do we use cookies' tab for full details). 

In doing so, we may change the cookies and other technologies we use, and how we use them.

As a result, we will need to change this policy from time to time to keep it accurate and up to date.

If we change this policy, we will tell you when you next visit our website, and give you a link to our revised policy. That way you can check to see if you are happy with our new arrangements and adjust your browser settings if you want to, before proceeding any further. Entering the website will constitute your acceptance, whether or not you choose to review these changes.

Please look out for these notices in future when you are using our website.
