# MusicSpace.com - Privacy Policy

  
Once you have registered at or made a purchase from MusicSpace.com, occasionally we will send you special offers or announcements via email. You can tell us to discontinue sending you these emails at any time by logging in and modifying your profile. 

From time to time, MusicSpace.com shares customer information with trustworthy third parties that offer products or services you may be interested in. You can tell us not to share this information at any time by logging in and modifying your profile. 

In addition, MusicSpace.com may from time to time provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors; this data will never include personally identifying information. MusicSpace.com may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (1) comply with law; (2) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements; or (3) protect the rights, property, or safety of MusicSpace.com, our users, or others. 

In the future, MusicSpace.com or its subsidiaries might merge with or be acquired by another business entity. Should such a combination occur, please be aware that customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets.

MusicSpace.com may display links to other sites whose customer information policies and practices differ from ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

MusicSpace.com sometimes may offer contests, sweepstakes, or promotions that are sponsored by or co-sponsored with identified third parties. By virtue of their sponsorship or co-sponsorship, these third parties may obtain personally identifiable information voluntarily submitted by contest, sweepstakes, or promotion entrants. Though in these instances MusicSpace.com will make its privacy policy clear to those parties involved, MusicSpace.com ultimately has no control over the third-party sponsors' use of this information.
