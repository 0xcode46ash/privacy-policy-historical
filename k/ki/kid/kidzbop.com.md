### 

KIDZBOP.com is a FREE and SAFE social network and video sharing site just for kids. At KIDZBOP.com we offer our Members the ability to express themselves safely by uploading user generated content (videos and photos). This content is pre-screened via our trained moderation staff, to ensure your child NEVER shares or displays any personally identifiable information. At KIDZBOP.com Members can safely express themselves (via our "SafeText Messaging System") by creating "Status" updates on their My Channel pages. They can also send and receive Friend Requests with other Members on our site. If your child and another Member become friends, we allow them to post text comments, via our "SafeText Messaging System," on each others' videos, photos and My Channel pages. To ensure the safety of this communication we have implemented state-of-the-art Crisp ([www.crisp.com](http://crispthinking.com/solution-U13.htm)) moderation software, which contains automatic filters that prevent members from easily sharing any personal information, and a back end moderation system which alerts our moderators to possible infractions that we can then investigate. In addition, we give your child the ability to easily delete any text comments they receive and to report any abuse by another member.

Our website, KIDZBOP.com, is hosted by KIDZBOP, LLC a USA company with offices at 214 Sullivan Street 4th Floor NY, NY 10012.

### 

At KIDZBOP.com it's our policy to collect a minimum amount of information from our visitors. When users, including children under 13, register on KIDZBOP.com we ask them for the following information: Membername, Password, Birthday, Gender and Zip Code. For users under the age of 13 we also ask them to provide their parent or guardian's email address so the parent/guardian can approve their child's participation on our site. Users 13 and older can provide their own email address. At KIDZBOP.com no further personally identifiable information is required to participate in any activity.

Optionally, children under 13 may provide their own email address if they wish to receive KIDZ BOP Email Alerts. Email Alerts are notifications that we send to your child's profile page and, if your child requests, to their provided email address. Your child's email address will never be revealed by us on the site and will never be shared with a 3rd Party for any reason. If a child gives us their email to receive Email Alerts we send the parent an email alerting them of this and provide the parent the ability to deactivate email alerts for their child's account. If the parent decides to deactivate Email Alerts we will delete the child's email address from our database.

KIDZBOP, LLC is the sole owner of all information collected on KIDZBOP.com.

KIDZBOP.com uses the parent or guardian's email address provided at registration to notify parents that their child wishes to become a Member of KIDZBOP.com. In that initial notice, parents are provided a link to this privacy policy, and details about how their kids can use KIDZBOP.com. Parents are required to provide their consent before their child's accounts can be activated. Parent email addresses are used to communicate with parents about their kids in relation to their activity at KIDZBOP.com - such as a forgotten password or content their child has uploaded to our site. Upon activation of an account, the information submitted will be used by KIDZBOP, LLC to create a personalized "My Channel" page for the user and will allow the registered user to participate on the KIDZBOP.com website, which contains a variety of interactive features. Within those features, users are identified in the community by their Membername, age, and gender. This limited (and non-personal) identifying information will be displayed to the child's friends and others who have obtained the child's Membername.

At KIDZBOP.com we allow Members to submit user generated content (videos and photos). We pre-screen all content via our trained staff to ensure it does not contain any personally identifiable information and that it follows our other [Kidz Bop Rules of Play](http://www.kidzbop.com/parents#safety). If any user generated content we receive does not comply with our Kidz Bop Rules of Play, it will be flagged, will NOT appear on our site, and will automatically be deleted after 30 days.

To make sure you are kept up to date on your child's activity on our site we send the parent an email when:

  * **Your child's content has been moderated:** After reviewing your child's content we will email you to let you know whether or not your child's content followed [Kidz Bop Rules of Play](http://www.kidzbop.com/parents#safety). If the content IS approved, we will email you a link to view the content on our site. If you do not approve of the content your child has uploaded, your child has the ability to delete any user-generated content at anytime from their Channel page. If the content is NOT approved, we will email you and let you know the reason the content was flagged. Flagged content will NOT appear on our site and will be automatically deleted from our database.

They can change or cancel their Alerts at any time from their My Channel Settings page. Your child's phone number will never be revealed by us on the site and will never be shared with a 3rd Party for any reason.

KIDZBOP, LLC makes every reasonable effort to disallow and discourage users and kids from sharing personally identifying information with each other via the interactive features via a filter system and our trained moderators. The only information that can be openly shared in the KIDZBOP.com features are Membernames (and we caution users not to select their real names), age, gender and moderated messages.

### 

Parents and legal guardians of kids under 13 who are members of KIDZBOP.com have certain rights under COPPA, and KIDZBOP, LLC recognizes those rights. Parents/guardians can consent to collection and use of a child's personally identifiable information (PII) without consenting to the disclosure of information to third parties. Currently the only identifiable information we collect from children is the parent email address and, if they provide it, their own email address. We will not knowingly register children under 13 years of age on KIDZBOP.com without parental consent. Without consent, a child under 13 cannot use any of the community features. If a parent does not provide consent, we will delete the information provided during the registration process within a reasonable time period. A child's participation or access to an activity on our site is not conditioned on their providing more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary for the activity.

Parents/guardians can review information their children have contributed to KIDZBOP.com, request that KIDZBOP, LLC delete that information, and refuse to allow KIDZBOP, LLC to collect further information from their kids by contacting our Customer Services department by email at [parenthelp@kidzbop.com](mailto:parenthelp@kidzbop.com). Parents should include their child's KIDZBOP.com Membername and the registered (parent/guardian) email address in the email so we can better assist them with their inquiry or request. KIDZBOP may ask additional questions or take other steps to verify the identity of parents/guardians before responding to a request to review or delete their child's information, or a request to refuse further collection from their child.
