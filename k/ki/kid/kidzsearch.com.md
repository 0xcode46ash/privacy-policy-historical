1\. What personal information does KidzSearch collect?

**

KidzSearch does not collect visitors' personally identifiable information without consent, nor does KidzSearch require visitors to give personally identifiable information in order to access or use our site. KidzSearch will not require a visitor to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity as a condition of that participation. The KidzSearch site contains links to other Web sites that may ask for personal information. Although we try to review such sites carefully, KidzSearch expressly disclaim any responsibility or liability for the privacy policies, data collection practices or regulatory compliance of those independent sites. KidzSearch may have offers for a subscription newsletter. Visitors must voluntarily enter their email in order to receive our newsletter. We do not sell email names or provide access to third-parties.  Personal information, such as names, phone numbers, or address details are never collected. 

**2\. Does KidzSearch use cookies?**

No.

**3\. Does KidzSearch collect aggregated information?**

KidzSearch collects statistics on which keywords a visitor searches and which responses they select. This information is gathered together (aggregated) so that individual visitors cannot be identified or distinguished from the whole. For example, we might know that 100 visitors searched for giraffes, but we do not know who those visitors were. This information helps us make editorial and design decisions to make KidzSearch more helpful and even easier to use. In addition, we may use this information to help us target advertising or content for the site in general. We also may collect IP Addresses (which domain a visitor is logged on from), Referral Data (the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to KidzSearch), Browser type (which browser is being used), Platform Type (whether a visitor uses Macintosh or Windows), and Traffic Flow (where a visitor spends their time while on the site) on our site, however these collected pieces of information do not allow for personal identification of the visitor.

**4\. Does KidzSearch have a chat room?**

No.

**5\. Does KidzSearch run contests for children?**

We may have periodic contests.  Collected information is never given out to third-parties.
