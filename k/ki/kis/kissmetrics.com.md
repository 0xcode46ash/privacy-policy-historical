#### Visitors to KISSmetrics’ Clients’ Websites

Our Clients may use customized and proprietary KISSmetrics’ code, software and/or services (“Service”) to obtain information regarding the activities that users engage in while visiting their web pages (“Client’s User Data”). When a user visits a website that uses KISSmetrics’ Service, KISSmetrics code contained on the website contacts KISSmetrics’ servers and enables KISSmetrics to collect Client’s User Data. Some Clients may also use their own code to obtain Client’s User Data and then send such information to KISSmetrics’ servers.

Client’s User Data is stored on KISSmetrics’ web servers and databases for use in performing analysis and producing reports for the KISSmetrics Client only. Please note that KISSmetrics itself uses the KISSmetrics Service in order to obtain insights into visitors’ activities on http://www.kissmetrics.com and http://blog.KISSmetrics.com/.

KISSmetrics’ collection and analysis of Client’s User Data helps our Clients to evaluate and understand how their users are interacting with their websites, and potentially, to modify their websites in order to make them more valuable or useful for their users. KISSmetrics’ Clients determine the types of Client’s User Data that are sent to KISSmetrics’ servers for analysis. This data may include or be linked to Personally Identifiable Information depending on how the Client uses KISSmetrics’ Services on its website(s).

In addition, KISSmetrics may collect certain information about a Client’s Visitor’s computer that may be provided by the Visitor’s browser. This includes browser information, operating system information, mobile device information, IP address, time of visit, and the referring site, application, or service. Such information is collected even though not determined not determined by the Client.

Because Clients have the sole discretion to determine what Information KISSmetrics collects about or from the Clients’ users, this Privacy Policy _does not_ apply to any Client’s User Data, including Personally Identifiable Information, that KISSmetrics may collect, obtain, or access in connection with operating the KISSmetrics Service.

### KISSmetrics’ Use of Cookies and Web Beacons

#### Cookies

KISSmetrics uses cookies (small text files that KISSmetrics stores locally on your computer) on our Client’s websites for one or more of the following purposes: to help identify unique visitors and/or devices; assess usage patterns and perform traffic analysis; identify visitor preferences; conduct A/B testing; diagnose problems with our servers, and otherwise administer the KISSmetrics Service. KISSmetrics does not use methods such as browser cache, Flash cookies, or eTags, for acquiring or storing information about end users web browsing activity on Client websites or otherwise.

Depending on how our Clients use KISSmetrics’ Services, information contained in KISSmetrics cookies placed on the computers of end users may be linked to Personally Identifiable Information in KISSmetrics’ database. This allows our Clients to use the KISSmetrics Service to better analyze and measure their users’ interactions with their website and to organize activities by the same user on their website across time.

In addition, please be aware that even if you configure your browser settings to reject all cookies, your activity on KISSmetrics client websites will still be recorded by our Service, unless you opt out of our Service as set forth below. However, your rejection of all cookies will prevent KISSmetrics from determining whether or not someone using your computer has previously visited the website, i.e., whether or not the visitor is a “unique” visitor.

Please note that if you set your browser to reject cookies, some features of the websites you visit may be unavailable. For more information on how to reject cookies, see your browser's instructions on changing your cookie settings. Additionally, please note that rejecting cookies may also prevent you from [opting out of our Service](https://web.archive.org/user-privacy) because that involves placing an opt-out cookie in your browser.
