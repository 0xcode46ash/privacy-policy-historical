# Kiewit Privacy Policy

June 13, 2001

Peter Kiewit Sons', Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates ("Kiewit") own and operate a number of Internet domains, including but not limited to this Website (the "Website").

This statement describes Kiewit's Website privacy practices.

**Privacy Philosophy**

The Internet is rapidly changing the way we communicate and interact. While the Internet may provide access to more information and services than ever before, these new online activities raise new challenges, such as the privacy issues addressed in this policy. We welcome your feedback regarding this Website and our Privacy Policy. Please address all comments to webmaster@kiewit.com.

**What Information is Collected**

You may be asked at various times to provide data such as your name, e-mail address and phone number (the "Personally Identifiable Information"), as well as information about what you like or do not like about the Website. Kiewit collects Personally Identifiable Information online primarily to make it easier for you to use the Website and for us to communicate with you. 

Our data collection policies are intended to allow you to choose how much Personally Identifiable Information to provide to us, and to control how we use that information. Our goal is to provide you with a satisfying online experience. 

Information collected online is often defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable:

Anonymous Information refers to information that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For instance, we may know that 10,000 people visit this Privacy Policy page today, but we do not necessarily know their names, where they live, or their date of birth. What we collect from transactions such as this constitutes anonymous information. 

Personally Identifiable Information tells us who you are. We may need this information to provide personalized or enhanced service that you request. While we hope that you will find it beneficial to judiciously provide Personally Identifiable Information so that we can provide the best practical service to you, the amount of Personally Identifiable Information that you choose to disclose is completely up to you. The only way we know something about you personally is if you choose to share this type of information with us.

When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser automatically transmits some information to Kiewit every time you access our Website. Examples of such information include the URL of the Web page you were just on (known as the "Refer"), the IP (or Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, and the browser version you are using to access our site. Some of this information may be collected by Kiewit to help us improve our offerings to you. For instance, we may use this information to ensure the content you request is presented in the best format.

To activate some of the features available within the Website, we may assign "cookies" to your Internet browser. On our system, a cookie is a small text file that contains a unique identification number stored on your computer. Our cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. This unique identification number automatically identifies your browser - but not you - to our server computers when you interact with our Website. When you visit our Website, our server computers read your cookie. The contents of your cookie are reported in our server logs. But it is only when you agree to provide Personally Identifiable Information directly to a service, such as through registration, that we will be able to know anything about you other than the random number that our server computers originally assign to your browser.

There is a lot of confusion about cookies, how they are used, and what they can do. On our system, cookies only contain information that our server computer "knew" in the first place, and can only be read by the serving domain that placed them. Cookies are an essential part of how the Internet works today, and allow our server computers to recognize your computer's browser when you return. Since our cookies are only text files, they cannot "run" on your computer and have no ability to search your computer for other information, or transmit it to anyone

Following are our responses to some likely questions regarding our Privacy Policy:

**What organization is collecting the information?**

The data you provide is collected by Kiewit.

**How will the information be used?**

Below is a description of some of the uses of the information that we collect and how our users benefit from these actions:

We try to pay attention to what our users use and do not use on our Website and modify our content appropriately. The creation of an anonymous profile allows Kiewit to identify the information that you find most useful, without ever knowing your name or any other Personally Identifiable Information. We may use these anonymous profiles to improve our Website's content and format. This is essential to our ability to provide high quality content to you. 

We do not match "Who you are" with "Where you've been" on the Internet, because we do not use personal data characteristics such as your name, address or phone number to create these anonymous profiles but rather use general information such as browser version and IP address. Finally, our anonymous profiles present no privacy risk to our customers because they are worthless to third parties. Since any potential third party would be unable to read the cookies that we set on our domains, only Kiewit can create value from these anonymous profiles.

We develop summary - but not individual - reports. An example of a summary report might be "12,000 people visited Page 'X' today, and of those people, 75% had browser version "X". 

**What information will you distribute?**

If you provide Personally Identifiable Information to us, it is our plan to limit its use to the Kiewit Website. 

However, our server computers may retain whatever Personally Identifiable Information you have provided to us, and such data could potentially be made available for distribution to third parties as required by law, such as to law-enforcement agencies or pursuant to subpoenas or other court orders. In such case, Kiewit shall have no obligation to notify you of, or decline, any appropriately documented request for Personally Identifiable Information. 

This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the Kiewit Websites. Kiewit does not control the information collection and distribution policies on Internet domains other than on Kiewit Internet domains. As a service to our users, the Kiewit Website may provide links to other sites. Kiewit is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage all users to read the privacy statements of each and every Website.

**What choices are available regarding collection, use, and distribution of the information?**

We encourage you to share information only with those websites that provide true value to you in exchange for your information and that commit to privacy practices that are acceptable to you. We believe that Kiewit's websites provide such value, but it is ultimately your choice to share Personally Identifiable Information with Kiewit.

While Kiewit does not intend to sell any information you submit to our Website to any other parties, Kiewit reserves the right to use such information for any lawful purpose, including but not limited to recruiting, marketing, performance monitoring and statistical analysis. 

Kiewit also reserves the right to send registration confirmations, Service Alerts and similar messages to our users to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use our Website, regardless of such users' e-mail contact opt-in status. Kiewit retains these rights because we may need the right to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters that may be important to you.

Questions regarding this Privacy Policy should be submitted via e-mail to [webmaster@kiewit.com](mailto:webmaster@kiewit.com) If we have not responded to your inquiry in a timely manner or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, please contact us at 402-342-2052, extension 2685.
