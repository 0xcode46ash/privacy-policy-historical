# eBay Classifieds: Privacy

On February 7, 2012 the eBay Classifieds Privacy Policy was updated. Please take a few minutes and review the revised policy. If you have any questions, please [contact us](http://www.ebayclassifieds.com/m/Help?mode=CONTACT_US). If you do not accept this revised policy, eBay Classifieds may not be able to provide you with our services. Accordingly, you may close your account [here](mailto:privacy@ebayclassifieds.com).

This privacy policy describes how the eBay Classifieds website, tools, applications, and services ("eBay Classifieds") handle your personal information. eBay Classifieds collects, uses, and shares personal information to help eBay Classifieds work and to keep eBay Classifieds safe (details below). This policy is effective February 7, 2012. To see the previous policy, click here.

**Binding Corporate Rules**. In addition to the privacy practices set out in this Privacy Policy, eBay Inc., the parent company of eBay Classifieds, has established a set of Corporate Rules (also referred to as Binding Corporate Rules), approved by a number of European Union privacy regulators. These Corporate Rules are a commitment by eBay Inc. to adequately protect your personal information regardless of where the data resides, and depending upon your location, may provide additional privacy rights through your privacy regulator or a court. If you would like additional information regarding the Corporate Rules contact us via the contact details below.

**Collection**. Information posted on eBay Classifieds is obviously publicly available. Our servers are located in the United States, European Union, and elsewhere in the world where eBay Classifieds has facilities. Therefore, if you choose to provide us with personal information, you are consenting to eBay Classifieds' collection, use, disclosure of your personal information and to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere in the world where eBay Classifieds has facilities. eBay Classifieds collects and stores the following personal information:

  * email address, phone numbers, physical contact information, and (depending on the service used) sometimes financial information;
  * computer sign-on data, statistics on page views, traffic to and from eBay Classifieds and ad data (all through cookies - you can take steps to disable the cookies on your browser although this is likely to affect your ability to use the site);
  * other information, including users IP address and standard web log information.



**Use**. eBay Classifieds uses users' personal information to:

  * provide our services
  * resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;
  * encourage safe trading and enforce our policies;
  * customize, measure, and improve user experience and our services, content, and advertising
  * deliver targeted marketing, service updates and promotional offers to you according to your preferences;
  * do other things for users as described when eBay Classifieds collects the information.



**Disclosure**. eBay Classifieds doesn't sell or rent users' personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without users explicit consent. eBay Classifieds may disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements, enforce our policies, respond to claims that a posting or other content violates other's rights, or protect anyone's rights, property, or safety. eBay Classifieds may also share personal information with:

  * corporate affiliates who help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and provide joint services. (Our corporate affiliates will market only to users who ask them to).
  * service providers who help with our business operations.
  * third-party websites and publishers so ads (or the content of the ads) published on eBay Classifieds can also be published on a broader array of venues or information vehicles.



**Registration and sharing through third-party services**. eBay Classifieds may offer single sign-on services that allow you to use third party login credentials to sign into eBay Classifieds, with your permission, eBay Classifieds may also transfer profile information contained in your third-party profile. eBay Classifieds may also, for your use, enable you to import information about who you are connected to, as well as enable you to share information with those third-party sites (other than listings), at your discretion. If you wish to discontinue you such sharing, you will be able to do so through your preference page.

**Communications and email tools**. You agree to receive marketing communications from us unless you tell us that you prefer not to receive such communications. If you don't wish to receive marketing communications from us, simply indicate your preference by following directions provided with the communication. You may not use our site or communication tools to harvest addresses, send spam or otherwise breach our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20160201140225id_/http%3A//www.ebayclassifieds.com/m/TermsAndConditions) or Privacy Policy. eBay Classifieds may automatically scan and manually filter email messages sent via our communication tools for malicious activity or prohibited content, but eBay Classifieds does not permanently store such messages. If you use our tools to send content to a friend, eBay Classifieds doesn't permanently store your friends' addresses or use or disclose them for marketing purposes. To report spam from other users, please contact [customer support](http://www.ebayclassifieds.com/m/Help?mode=CONTACT_US)

**Access, Modification, and Deletion**. You can see, modify or erase most of your personal information by reviewing and modifying your posting or account status page, by signing on to 'My eBay Classifieds' or by contacting [customer support](http://www.ebayclassifieds.com/m/Help?mode=CONTACT_US) to review any personal information eBay Classifieds stores that is not available on eBay Classifieds. There may be a charge associated with such requests but these will not exceed the amounts permitted by law. eBay Classifieds deletes personal information when eBay Classifieds no longer need it for the purposes we described earlier. eBay Classifieds retains personal information as permitted by law to resolve disputes, enforce our policies; and prevent bad guys from coming back. If you have further questions, you can write to the Data Controller:

We may share your information with members of the eBay Inc. corporate family like eBay or PayPal to provide joint content and services (like registration, transactions and customer support), to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to guide decisions about their products, services and communications. Members of our corporate family will use this information to send you marketing communications only if you've requested their services.

**Security**. eBay Classifieds uses lots of tools (encryption, passwords, physical security) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure, but as you probably know, nothing's perfect, so eBay Classifieds makes no guarantees.

**Cookies**. eBay Classifieds or our service providers may use "cookies" (small files placed on your hard drive) on certain of our pages to help analyze our web page flow; customize our services, content and advertising; measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety.
