We will not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first letting you know and offering you a choice.

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, the Firm uses commercially appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. However, we have put in place various security procedures as set out in this policy. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.
