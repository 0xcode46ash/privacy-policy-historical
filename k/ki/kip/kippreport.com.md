###### Mediaquest is committed to protecting your personal information and keeping its services safe and enjoyable for all. * To learn more about Mediaquest’s online information practises and the choices that you can make about the way your information is collected and used, click here.

## Why is my personal information collected?

This notice applies to all information, collected or submitted, on  _Kipp Report_ and applications for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and other devices and platforms, hereafter referred to as simply  _Kipp Report_.

_Kipp Report_ occasionally needs to collect information for convenience, practicality, or technical requirements. This includes:

  * Your current subscription status and basic information,  **not including**  credit-card numbers or other payment details.
  * Anonymous usage statistics.
  * Information supplied to  _Kipp Report_ by Apple, which may include your name, email address, and ZIP code if you opted into the collection of this information upon subscribing.



Like most websites,  _Kipp Report_ also collects and stores information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider, your IP address, and information provided by and about your Internet browser. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather similar information through other means. We may also use “cookie” technology for your convenience as we see fit, such as to keep you logged in between visits if we add a login feature.

We use Emarsys to manage our mailing list. Emarsys says this about its usage of information about our subscribers:

_Your subscriber lists are stored on a secure_ Emarsys _server. We don’t, under any circumstances, sell your lists, contact people on your lists, market to people on your lists, steal your lists, or share your lists with any other party, unless it’s required by law. If someone on your list complains or contacts us, we may then contact that person. Only authorized employees have access to view Distribution Lists._

## How is my personal information used?

We use the information you provide to operate  _Kipp Report_  and its various features.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design  _Kipp Report_. For instance, we may make feature decisions based on the percentage of our readership using a certain device or operating system.

We may also share non-identifying and aggregate statistics with potential future advertisers and partners. For instance, we may tell an advertiser or partner how many people visited a certain area on our website, used a certain feature of the application, or viewed a certain issue or article. When information is used in this or a similar manner, we do not disclose anything that could be used to identify the individuals on whom the information is based.

We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or to defend against legal claims.

We may disclose your information when we believe it necessary or desirable in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our policies, and/or to protect our rights and property.

In the future, we may sell, buy, merge, or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

## External Services

External services beyond  _Kipp Report_  ’s control are integrated with  _Kipp Report_  where necessary, such as [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) for traffic measurement and tracking.  _Kipp Report_  makes reasonable efforts to ensure that all integrated external services are trustworthy and reputable, but we cannot be held responsible for data collection and usage by such services. ****

**Will Mediaquest sell or give my personal information to third parties?**

We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish  _Kipp Report_ ’s functionality.

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

**How does Mediaquest protect my personal information?**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

**How do I unsubscribe from Mediaquest communications I no longer wish to receive?**

**Marketing provided by Mediaquest.**  From time to time we may send you promotional materials on behalf of Mediaquest and/or third parties. You shall receive emails according the preference selected in your account. You can opt for daily, weekly or catagorised news at point of registration. __ If you want us to stop sending you promotional materials to your email, you may follow the unsubscribe instructions in the email or manage your preferences at [Emarsys](http://hearst.ed4.net/profile/login.cfm).

**Exceptions.** ** ** If you have opted-out as described above, and thereafter you elect to use a service or promotion that requires us to contact you or share your information with a third party (e.g., you enter into a contest or sweepstakes or use an ecommerce service after opting-out), then your previous opt-out preferences will not apply to such service. Despite your indicated preferences, we may send you service-related communications, including notices about your subscription, and we may continue disclosing your information to third parties under the Service Provider Exception, Legal Exceptions, and Acquisition Exception described above.

**Device Settings.**  Our digital applications may provide you alerts and you can change your preferences regarding these alerts through your device settings.
