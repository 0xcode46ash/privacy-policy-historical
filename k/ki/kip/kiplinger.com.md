Our server automatically recognizes the domain name of visitors. We collect domain names in an effort to keep statistics on what pages are being accessed and how often.

When information is provided via feedback forms, we capture all of the information the user provides, the user's email address and the type of browser being used. However, this information is not compiled or used for any purposes other than to communicate with the user.

On occasion, we will put a survey on the site. This information is used primarily to help improve the site. We share information about our users with advertisers and business partners. However, we keep and share only aggregate numbers. For example, we will say x percent of our users are females and y percent males.

Users have the option of signing up for a weekly email update. Kiplinger promotions, as well as outside advertising, may appear on email updates. The email addresses are not shared with other companies or organizations. Users can remove their names from the email subscription list at any time by going to <http://www.kiplinger.com/unsubscribe/>.

On occasion, the site will place a "cookie" in a file on your computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information. The company that Kiplinger uses to serve ads on the site uses cookies for various tracking purposes. Users always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences. 

This web site contains links to third party sites. These include links to advertiser sites, and partners that may use Kiplinger's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These sites are not under the control of Kiplinger Washington Editors, Inc., and are not covered under this Privacy Policy Statement. 

Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on the forums or during a chat, that information can be collected and used by others not connected with Kiplinger Washington Editors, Inc., and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties. 

If you supply us with your postal address when signing up for any of Kiplinger's print publications, you should be aware that from time to time Kiplinger makes its subscriber list available to carefully screened companies. However, Kiplinger never sells email addresses. If you are a print subscriber and would rather not receive such solicitations, send your mailing label to P.O. Box 3292, Harlan, IA 51593-0472 and instruct Kiplinger to exclude your name.
