# Privacy Policy — Kickstarter

_This policy officially goes into effect and replaces the[previous version](https://web.archive.org/privacy/aug2014) on April 28, 2015. _

### What We Collect

In order for you to create an account on Kickstarter and use our services, we need to collect and process some information. Depending on your use of the Services, that may include:

  * information (such as your name, email and postal addresses, telephone number, and country of residence) that you provide by completing forms on Kickstarter, including if you register as a user of the Services, subscribe to our newsletters, upload or submit any material through Kickstarter, or request any information;
  * your login and password details, in connection with the account sign-in process;
  * details of any requests or transactions you make through the Services;
  * information about your activity on and interaction with Kickstarter, such as your IP address and the type of device or browser you use;
  * communications you send to us (for example, when you ask for support, send us questions or comments, or report a problem); and
  * information that you submit to Kickstarter in the form of comments, contributions to discussions, or messages to other users.



### What’s Private

This data will not be publicly displayed or revealed to other users:

  * any payment information you provide
  * your password details
  * your IP address
  * your phone number
  * communications you send to us (for example, when you ask for support, send us questions or comments, or report a problem)



We don’t give your personal information to any third-party services, except when it’s necessary to provide Kickstarter’s Services (like when we partner with payment processors). When we share data with third-party services that support our delivery of the Kickstarter Services, we require that they protect your personal information to the same standards we do.

We do reserve the right to disclose personal information when we believe that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with the law or law enforcement, to prevent fraud or abuse, or to protect Kickstarter’s legal rights.

### What’s Only Shared with Creators

When you back a project, the project’s creator will know your account name, the amount you have pledged, and the reward you have selected. Creators never receive backers’ credit card details or other payment information.

If a project you have backed is successfully funded, the creator will receive the email address associated with your Kickstarter account. They may also send you a survey requesting information needed to provide your reward. (For instance, they may need your mailing address, or T-shirt size.) Any information you provide in such surveys will be received by the creator.

Creators may also receive anonymized information about the ways people visit and interact with their project pages, in the form of routine traffic analytics. You can choose not to be included in Google Analytics [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

### What’s Public

When you create an account, we create a basic profile page for you on Kickstarter, containing your account name, the date the account was created, and a list of projects you have backed or launched. Whenever your account name appears on Kickstarter (for instance, when you post comments, send messages, or back projects), people can click your account name to see your profile. The profile is not searchable on Kickstarter or via search engines like Google. Here are some of the things that will be publicly viewable on your profile, or elsewhere on Kickstarter:

  * the account name, and the date it was created
  * any information you choose to add to your profile (like a picture, bio, or your location)
  * projects you've backed (but not pledge amounts or rewards chosen)
  * projects you've launched
  * any comments you’ve posted on Kickstarter
  * if you have "Liked" a project update



Please note that each project page lists the community of users who have backed the project. If you don’t want others to see your name in a project’s Backers tab, choose an account name that is not identifiable (e.g., CatLuvr02).

Creators are also asked to verify their identities before launching a project. Once this has been done, the creator’s Verified Name will be publicly displayed on their account profile and on any projects they launch.

### Uses of Your Personal Information

We will use the personal information you provide to:

  * identify you when you sign in to your account;
  * enable us to provide you with the Services;
  * send you marketing communications we think you may find useful, but only in accordance with your email preferences;
  * present projects to you when you use the Services which we believe will be of interest based on your geographic location and previous use of the Services;
  * administer your account with us;
  * enable us to contact you regarding any question you make through the Services;
  * analyze the use of the Services and the people visiting to improve our content and Services; and
  * use for other purposes that we may disclose to you when we request your information.



We take securing your data and preserving your privacy very seriously. We never post anything to your Facebook, Twitter, or other third-party accounts without your permission. Kickstarter Project Creators never receive backers’ credit card details or other payment information. We do not and will not sell your data.

### Email

We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. We try to keep emails to a minimum and give you the ability to opt out of any marketing communications we send.

We will send you email relating to your personal transactions. You will also receive certain marketing email communications, in accordance with your preferences, and from which you may opt out at any time.

We may send you service-related announcements on the rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.

### Wrap-up

To modify or delete the personal information you have provided to us, please log in and update your profile. We may retain certain information as required by law or for necessary business purposes.

On request, we will give you a copy of all the personal information about you that we hold. This information is subject to a fee not exceeding the prescribed fee permitted by law.

People under 18 (or the legal age in your jurisdiction) are not permitted to use Kickstarter on their own, and so this privacy policy makes no provision for their use of Kickstarter.

Information that you submit through the Services may be transferred to countries other than where you reside (for example, to our servers in the United States). We will protect all information we receive in accordance with this privacy policy.
