When you request pages from Kickboard websites, our servers log your computer’s IP address. Kickboard collects these IP addresses for the sole purpose of identifying our users’ service providers (whether AOL, MSN, etc.) so we can better develop our offerings at the Kickboard websites. We do not automatically link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, however we can and will use IP addresses to identify users when we feel it is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or comply with legal process served on Kickboard; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Kickboard; (3) protect the personal safety of other Kickboard websites users or the public; or (4) to ensure compliance with our Terms of Use, including the Terms of Use for the Kickboard Corporate Websites and the Terms of Use for the Kickboard Customer Websites.
