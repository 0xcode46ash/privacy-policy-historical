## Privacy Policy

### Data protection

Kingston University endeavours to comply fully with the Data Protection Act 1998 in its handling of personal data. We aim to keep your data safely and securely and to use them only for stated purposes. Details of the University’s Notification to the Information Commissioner setting out brief details of how we use your data can be found by clicking on the following link and entering “Kingston University” in the “Name” field: [www.ico.gov.uk/ESDWebPages/search.asp1](http://www.ico.gov.uk/ESDWebPages/search.asp)

Where you give us personal data through the website in order for us to provide you with a service, your data will be used in connection with that service. In some cases we may hold data for use in connection with future contacts you may make with the University. For example, data obtained during the recruitment process may be linked with data subsequently collected if you enrol as a student. 

We do not sell or give your data to other organisations for marketing purposes. We may use your data to make you aware of similar services to those you may have used or enquired about. We will offer you the opportunity to decline such future contact. 

We may pass some of your data to other organisations if this is required by law, is necessary for the prevention or detection of crime or is necessary in order to provide particular services to you. In particular it may be necessary to share data with organisations (such as other colleges and universities) that we work in partnership with or which are involved in student funding services (such as local authorities and the Student Loans Company) or other collaborative arrangements. Note that the Faculty of Health and Social Care Sciences is a joint faculty with St George’s, University of London, and that institution may also have access to Faculty-held data. Under the government funding regulations and/or by law, the University is required to share some personal data with government departments or agencies acting on their behalf. 

Some data collected may be used for our own research purposes in anonymous and non-attributable form.  

Please note that in most cases the University is unable to disclose information about students in response to third party requests (including those made by parents) without the prior written consent of the individual concerned, unless it is necessary to do so in order to comply with legal requirements or to prevent or detect crime.

You have the right under the Act to request copies of personal data relating to yourself that are held by the University, subject to a charge of £10.  Such requests should be made in writing to the address below, accompanied by a cheque for £10 made payable to “Kingston University.”  It is helpful if you can provide information that may assist us in our search for the data that you are seeking, such as your University ID number, or details of departments with which you may have had contact.  On receipt of these, the University will send you copies of data as soon as possible, and in any event within 40 days, provided exemptions specified by the Act do not apply.
