#### **Privacy Policy**

Kingston University endeavours to fully comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 in its handling of personal data. We aim to keep your data safely and securely and to use it only for stated purposes. Details of the University’s Notification to the Information Commissioner setting out brief details of how we use your data can be found through <http://www.esd.informationcommissioner.gov.uk/esd/search.asp> by typing Kingston University in the “Name” field. 

Where you give us personal data through the website in order for us to provide you with a service, your data will be used in connection with that service. In some cases we may hold data for use in connection with future contacts you may make with the University. For example, data obtained during the recruitment process may be linked with data subsequently collected if you enrol as a student. 

We do not sell or give your data to other organisations for marketing purposes. We may use your data to make you aware of similar services to those you may have used or enquired about. We will offer you the opportunity to decline such future contact. 

We may pass some of your data to other organisations if this is required by law, is necessary for the prevention or detection of crime or is necessary in order to provide particular services to you. In particular it may be necessary to share data with organisations (such as other colleges and universities) that we work in partnership with or which are involved in student funding services (such as local authorities and the Student Loans Company) or other collaborative arrangements. Note that the Faculty of Health and Social Care Sciences is a joint Faculty with St. George’s London who may also have access to Faculty held data. Under the government funding regulations and/or by law, the University is required to share some personal data with government departments or agencies acting on their behalf. 

Some data collected may be used for our own research purposes in anonymous and non-attributable form.  

If you have any queries relating to data protection or the use of data by the University, or wish to have access to your personal data held by the University,  please contact the

The University may levy a charge for access to personal data in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.
