# Blackbaud Privacy Policy

Blackbaud Privacy Policy

At Blackbaud, we are committed to protecting your privacy. You can travel through most of our site without giving us any information about yourself. But sometimes we do need information to provide services that you request, and this statement of privacy explains data collection and use in those situations. Please read this complete privacy statement. 

**Collecting your Personal Information**   
We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you are asked to register before entering a contest, subscribing to e-mail newsletters, completing an online survey, joining a limited-access premium site, viewing premium-level resource information, or when requesting information about or purchasing Blackbaud products and services. When you provide your personal information, a profile is created. If you ever want to review or update your profile, simply visit www.blackbaud.com and edit your personal information. We’ll ask you to disclose your User ID and Password so that only you can access your profile. The Blackbaud Web site assigns a personal identification number and sends it to your computer in the form of a small text file, called a "cookie." The use of this cookie allows you to visit other password-restricted portions of Blackbaud’s Web site — for which you have security access — without having to sign in again. 

**Use of your Personal Information**   
We use your personal information for four primary purposes: 

  * To make the site easier for you to use by not making you enter your personal information more than once. 
  * To help you quickly find information on Blackbaud software, services and customer support. 
  * To help us create and deliver content most relevant to you. 
  * To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new services from Blackbaud. 

We occasionally contract with other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. Blackbaud will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Blackbaud; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Blackbaud, and, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Blackbaud customers, visitors to Blackbaud’s Web site, or the public. 

**Control of your Personal Information**   
When you register, or otherwise give us personal information, Blackbaud will not share that information with third parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions already listed. It will only be used for the purposes stated above. Blackbaud may send out periodic e-mails informing you of technical service issues related to a product or service you requested. You will not be able to choose to unsubscribe to these mailings, as they are considered an essential part of the service you have chosen. 

**Access to your Personal Information  
** We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current. You may review and update this information at any time on [www.blackbaud.com](http://www.blackbaud.com/). You can: 

  * View and edit personal information you have already given us 
  * Subscribe or unsubscribe to Blackbaud email newsletters 

**Security of your Personal Information**   
Blackbaud strictly protects the security of your personal information and honors your choices for its intended use. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Your personal information is never shared outside the company without your permission, except under conditions explained above. Inside the company, data is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access. You also have a significant role in protecting your information. No one can see or edit your personal information without knowing your User ID and Password, so do not share these with others. 

**Use of Cookies**   
To ensure we are publishing content customers need and want, Blackbaud collects aggregated site-visitation statistics using cookies. When someone visits the site, a cookie is placed on the customer’s machine (if the customer accepts cookies) or is read if the customer has visited the site previously. If you choose to not have your browser accept cookies from Blackbaud’s Web site, you will need to re-enter your personal information each time that you attempt to access premium information.
