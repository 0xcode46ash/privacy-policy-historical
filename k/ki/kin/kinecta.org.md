**We care about you**  
And we value our relationship with you as a Credit Union member. Trust is primary in that relationship. We recognize our responsibility to keep the information you provide to us secure and confidential. Along with protecting your financial assets, protecting your privacy is our top priority. Our Privacy Policy is designed to do just that. This Policy is provided to you as required by law. Please read it carefully and keep it for your records. Service. Value. Trust. It’s what we’re about.

**Protecting your privacy**  
Our Privacy Policy explains how we protect the privacy of your personal information. It also describes certain situations where we release information about you to third parties, such as to maintain your account or other circumstances as required or permitted by law.

Our Privacy Policy also provides guidance on how you can direct us not to share certain information within our affiliated family of companies and with certain nonaffiliated third parties. It is your right to Opt Out. We are required to send you a copy of our Privacy Policy annually, yet if you choose to limit the sharing of information, you will only need to make your Opt Out request once.

As long as you maintain a relationship with us, you will receive notice of our Privacy Policy annually. If our information collection or sharing practices change, we will provide you with a revised Privacy Policy. If you have a joint account with someone else or have a co-borrower, please give this Privacy Policy to them to ensure that each of you is aware of our policy and your options. Our Privacy Policy is always available on request.

This revised Privacy Policy replaces our previous Privacy Policy.
