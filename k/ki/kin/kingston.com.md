If you disclose your personal information, we will only store and use such information that we need to meet your requests and our legitimate business objectives, including, where you have consented, providing you with information about products and services that we consider may be of interest to you. We primarily use your personal information to provide you an improved and customized online experience and service. We may use this information for marketing purposes.

Our servers are protected by firewalls and are physically located in secure data facilities to further increase security. 

We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology for mutual authentication, data encryption and data integrity.

Our goal is to ensure that our information about you is as accurate as possible and encourage you to promptly update your information if it changes. You may, at any time, access your information to update, modify or delete any inaccuracies by accessing your account through the Website. 

You may also request that we remove your account information from our databases. We will endeavor to remove as much information as legally allowable. However, as we generally keep information related to past transactions for our records, we may not be able to completely remove all of your information. 

YOUR RIGHTS

You have the right to ask us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your information) if we intend to use your information for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes.
