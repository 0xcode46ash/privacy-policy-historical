**Children's Privacy**  
This statement discloses the privacy practices for portions of KinderArt directed at children under 13. 

**KinderArt will NOT:**

When we do not obtain prior verifiable parental consent, online contact information will be used only to directly respond to the child's request and will not be used to contact the child for other purposes. 
  * Collect personally identifiable offline contact information from users under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. 
  * Distribute to any personally identifiable information collected from a child under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. 



KinderArt places prominent notices wherever personally identifiable information is collected requesting the child to ask a parent for permission to proceed.
