# FAQ & Privacy Policy at Killer Dana Surf Shop - Home of the Boardshort Superstore

## How can I check on my order?

We offer a feature to check the status of your order on our site [Click here to access your order history](http://www.killerdana.info/emordersummary.aspx). You may also call one of our amazing customer service representatives at 1.800.228.7873. They are waiting for your call from 9-5 p.m. PST.

## I have received my confirmation email but what is my order status?

Our system sends any person ordering from Killer Dana an initial confirmation email. This email will contain the complete order details only. The tracking and shipment details will come in a later email once the package has been processed.

## How do I return an item/order to Killer Dana?

All returns must be accompanied by our [Return Form](http://www.killerdana.com/killerdana/assets/images/ra_form.pdf). Fill it out completely and legibly using blue or black ink. Items must be returned within 30 days – no returns are accepted after 30 days from purchase date. Product must be in new, unused condition (no pet hair, odors, signs of wear, etc.) with tags in place. Once we receive your return, it can take up to 3 weeks to process your return and credit your account. Your credit card company may require up to an additional 5–7 days to post the credit to your account. Repackage your return item(s) in the original packaging and return the parcel along with this mandatory [Return Form](http://www.killerdana.com/killerdana/assets/images/ra_form.pdf).

## What about return shipping & handling?

Killer Dana uses SmartLabel, a simple and convenient return solution offered to our customers. If applicable, attach the pre-paid, pre-addressed return label on the other side of the packing slip to your return package. You pay nothing up front. We will deduct a $7.95 shipping cost from your refund. There is no charge for product mistakes on our behalf. Just leave the package with your mail carrier or drop it off at any U.S. Mail location. To track, go to [**http://tracking.smartlabel.com/**](http://tracking.smartlabel.com/) and use the SmartLabel tracking number found on the front of the packing slip. Please retain the top portion of your packing slip for your records.

**Please follow these steps:**

  1. Select the items you are returning, including a reason code in the shaded section.

  2. Indicate if you would like a refund or to order an alternate item (use the appropriate reason code).

  3. Enclose the return form in the original package (perforate at center section) retain the upper portion for your records.

  4. Remove or cover any other labels and barcodes from the package.




_Unfortunately we are unable to offer SmartLabel® returns for packages shipped to Alaska, Hawaii, U.S. Territories, APO/FPO addresses or other countries._

If you ship a return package on your own, please make sure to use a traceable **and** insured shipping method and send to the address below:

> **Killer Dana Returns**

## What is considered returnable merchandise?

We will accept the return of new, unworn, and tag still attached product. This means no human or pet hair allowed on the merchandise. Items that come to us smelling of smoke, cologne, or detergent will not be accepted. Pretty much anything that doesn’t smell new. Footwear must not be worn and have the original packaging (if any) and have all tags still attached. Surfboards cannot be returned without prior approval. Skateboards and skate accessories that are not ridden and are in the original packaging are accepted.

## What if I received a defective/incorrect product?

_Defective Merchandise_ : Killer Dana cannot guarantee the return for a defective item. This is because the item might no longer be in stock or that the item might look defective. What we mean is that some vendors make worn out looking items for that style or look. If the item is believed to be defective please return the item explaining the reason in the return portion of the receipt. 

_Incorrect items_ : Unfortunately, these mistakes do happen from time to time. We try our best to avoid them in shipping but once in a while they slip past us. If for any reason that you receive the incorrect merchandise, please return your incorrect item with the filled out return receipt, please see returns section for further detail. We will ship out the correct item with free ground shipping. No express shipping reimbursement will be permitted.

## My surfboard is damaged!

Please trust us that we would NEVER send a damaged surfboard (or any other goods for that matter). If this does occur please **SAVE ALL** packaging and contact us immediately at (800) 228-7873 and email us at info@killerdana.com. There is a process that the shipping carrier is going to need to perform to help process all claims.

  * If the damage is less than $100 we will gladly pay for the ding repair.

  * If the damage is greater than $100 we will have the board shipped back to us.




## What happens if something I order is out of stock?

Thanks to amazing technology and trial and error we have implemented a system to remove out-of-stock items from the online store. However, nobody is perfect. Contact our customer service department and we’ll do our best to help out when this situation occurs.

## How long does it take to process my return and/or credit?

Once returns are received we process them as soon as possible. However, certain times of the year take longer than expected. Usually, we have returns fully processed within approximately 3 weeks, this includes credits. Your issuing bank may take an additional billing cycle to display the credit to your card.

## Is my return guaranteed?

Killer Dana cannot guarantee any returns that are not received when shipped using a service other than the SmartLabel. To prevent this type of situation please make sure to use a traceable and insured shipping method. When returns are received, assuming the item(s) are in new/unused condition (see above requirements) your returns will be processed promptly.

## When will I know that my order has shipped?

The second email that is sent by our site will be the shipment confirmation email. This email will give you all that you need to track your package. This email will also include the date of shipment and the expected delivery date.

## What companies do you use for shipping?

We use Federal Express (FedEx) and USPS. Within FedEx there is also our “economy” shipping method, called SmartPost. This works by FedEx processing all of the package sorting and then delivers the package to your nearest USPS center. Once the package arrives at the USPS center your postman becomes the deliverer. Yes, SmartPost does take longer than other methods, but it offers our customers an economically friendly shipping price and great service. 

## What if I’m a foreign customer?

We are stoked that so many people outside of the United States want to be a part of Killer Dana’s surf culture. We do our best to handle these orders, but you should be aware of the following:

  * **Foreign customers are responsible for any and all fees and taxes that are incurred**. You can obtain more information at your local customs office. All goods are shipped FOB our warehouse. This means: 

_FOB- An International Term of Sale that means the seller fulfills his or her obligation to deliver when the goods have passed over the border at the named border of the country. This means that the buyer has to bear all costs and risks to loss of or damage to the goods from that point. ** _This includes the duties and taxes_**. The FOB term requires the seller to clear the goods for export._



  * The “Ship To” and “Bill To” addresses must be the same on all foreign addresses. ****

  * Large items, such as surfboards, board bags, beach chairs, etc. are not available for shipment outside of the U.S. and Canada. ****

  * Process time on these orders can take up to 4 business days. ****

  * **Surfboards** cannot be shipped outside of the U.S. ****




## What countries does Killer Dana ship to?

To look at the countries that we have cleared for shipping please follow this link. **[Country List](http://www.killerdana.com/Killer%20Dana/Country%20List.mht)**. 

## When will I know that my order has shipped?

The second email that is sent by our site will be the shipment confirmation email. This email will give you all that you need to track your package. This email will also include the date of shipment and the expected delivery date.

## How long does it take Killerdana to ship my order?

At Killerdana, we strive to ship your order within 24-72 hours (business days Mon-Fri) of receiving it, **excluding weekends and holidays**. We don't ship on weekends and are unable to ship on holidays. You will receive an email notifying you when your order ships including a tracking/confirmation number. During peak periods - such as Christmas - we may need an extra day or three to ship your package. We ship with Federal Express, Federal Express SmartPost, and USPS. Which carrier we choose depends on what type of shipping you choose (economy, priority ground, express, international, or APO/FPO,). While we try to give orders with Express Shipping special attention, orders placed after 11:00 a.m. EST/08:00 a.m. PST usually do not go out until the next shipping day (so if you order Friday afternoon, your package won't ship until Monday). At Christmas, Priority Mail may take in excess of 7 days to reach you. Certain products - namely board bags, boards, beach chairs, and other heavy or large items may take longer (usually 7-10 days). These items are **NOT** available for Express delivery. If you need something extra fast, please give us a call at 1.800.228.7873 and we will try our best to accommodate you. Orders for Alaska and Hawaii are shipped via USPS and Federal Express, so please make sure that you provide a deliverable shipping address. See shipping table below for more information.  


## How long does it take to receive my surfboard?

Thanks to FedEx and various other shipping couriers we have seen delivery only take up to 7 business days from the point of shipment. Surfboards need extra care for proper shipment and we would like to have 2 business days to process the order.  


## What is incremental charging?

Because we are often not capable of gaining the credit card address verification information on foreign addresses, we may require additional information before we can process your order.

We have begun using a process called “Incremental Charging.”  The way that this works is we will gain your consent to place two small charges on your account. These charges will range from$0.01 to $1.00 USD. Then we will require that you please email us with the proper amounts that were charged to your account. Once this is verified we will continually ship to you as a customer **under the card that the incremental charges were placed** , if a new card is to be used we will need to verify that card as well. This method is securing all of the hard working people and Killer Dana from potential fraud orders because we can not always verify the credit card information. This is not to push away customers but a security for all since there are always people trying to steal and harm the hard workers.

## Do you ship surfboards?

Killer Dana not only has taken over the boardshort market and now has its eye set on surfboards. Our goal is to try to maintain at the very minimum 1,000 surfboards constantly. From vintage to the latest fad, Killer Dana will carry it for you and keep you shredding.

## Where do you ship surfboards?

Killer Dana can only ship to the continental United States. No PO Box shipments allowed. **_The person ordering the surfboard must be available to sign for the board at the time of delivery._**

## I'm having trouble with my shopping cart.

Due to the way we upload and process our inventory data, we may experience a shopping cart "clearing" once a day. This usually happens in the middle of the night and only takes a minute. However, if you lose the items in your cart during checkout please either: call us so we can complete your order or just recreate the cart. If you get a timeout error or any other error when trying to complete an order, please call us at 1.800.228.7873 and we will take your order over the phone. You browser does need to allow cookies in order for items to be placed into your cart.

## How do I navigate in Killerdana.com?

The latest version of our website has a really cool feature called "guided navigation." This lets you drill down into the products by category, brand, gender, size, color, and price. This way, you can see exactly the stuff that you are interested in. Overwhelmed by 800 styles of boardshorts, start by just getting those together that are available in your size. With this new feature, you may start with more choices than you are used to, but you can quickly get into a group that is exactly what you like. You can even select a vendor from the menu and then type in a search term - our site will actually look at both these entries at the same time and bring back an exact group. Need to go back? We now have a cookie crumble on the page that shows the path you took to get where you are. Click any of the items in the crumble to go back there.

## I can't find the items I want.

If you are overwhelmed by the myriad of choices in our site, or if you can't find the item you desire, give us a call at 1.800.228.7873 so that we can try to find it for you. You can also email us at [info@killerdana.com.](mailto:info@killerdana.com)

## Why are there so many boardshorts? Why?

The reason behind this theory of ours is to offer you almost every style from many different brands. Normally you do not get to come even close to seeing the entire universe of boardshorts at your local shops or online. We at Killer Dana want to make that a possibility for you. For some brands, we have almost every style and typically in many different color ways. This can lead us to having hundreds of styles, but who cares. We simply love boardshorts. We have created the [Boardshort Superstore](http://www.killerdana.com/killerdana/search2.asp?search_submitted=yes&move=none&prod_sort=0&q_count=1&q0typ=cat&q0val1=93&q0val2=boardshorts&seach_freetext=&) as an entry point for you surf trunk adventure. There is even a [Boardshort Buyer's Guide](http://www.killerdana.com/killerdana/dept.asp?s_id=0&dept_id=11005) to help you understand your many choices.
