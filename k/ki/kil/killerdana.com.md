Which carrier we choose depends on what type of shipping you choose (ground, priority, express) and what carrier will get your package to you the fastest. While we try to give orders with Express Shipping special attention, orders placed after 11:00 a.m. EST usually do not go out until the next shipping day (so if you order Friday afternoon, your package won't ship until Monday). At Christmas, Priority Mail may take in excess of 7 days to reach you. Certain products - namely boardbags, boards, beachchairs, and other heavy or large items may take longer (usually 7-10 days). These items are not usually available for Express delivery. If you need something extra fast, please give us a call at 1-800-228-7873 and we will try to help you. Orders for Alaska and Hawaii are shipped via USPS, so please make sure that you provide a deliverable shipping address.

**6\. What happens if something I order is out of stock?** Our website contains a feature that removes out-of-stock items from the online store, but occasionally an item sells out within the day you may order, or for various reasons, the site isn’t quite up-to-date with exact inventory quantities. If an item on your order is sold out, we will still ship the available merchandise, and include an explanation in your package about any excluded items. If you’re entire order is sold out, we will notify you. Our friendly customer service department will do everything we can to accommodate your needs, but popular items are commonly known to sell out quickly. Feel free to include any special instructions in the comment box of your order.
