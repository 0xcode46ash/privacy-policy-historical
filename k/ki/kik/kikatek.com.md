# Kikatek.com | Privacy Policy and Statements

**Privacy Policy**

We understand that privacy is a very important issue to our customers, and it is our priority for it to be an equally important issue to us. We at Kikatek are commited to the protection of your privacy. It is our aim to be as clear and thorough as possible about what, how, and why we collect certain information about you. Should there be any issues or questions not fully explained, please [let us know](http://www.kikatek.com/contact_us.php).

**Compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998**

In order to continually improve our website and products range for you, we collect information about you to help us. These information includes analytical data such as your purchase history. These information are never, under any circumstances, disclosed to third parties unless under explicit authorisation by you or under the following situations. Third parties are employed to fulfill certain functions on behalf of Kikatek. 

Examples of these third parties might be a delivery courier who would require the delivery address to complete the shipment, and our payment processing provider, etc. However, rest assured that these companies are not permitted to retain or use such data in such a way that contradicts with the Data Protection Act 1998. We take all reasonable precautions to safeguard your private information through security policies and secure server technologies (details provided later in this document).

**Why we collect information about you**

In order to privide an efficient service to you our customers, we retain certain frequently required data about you that are needed to fulfill your orders. These include delivery addresses, contact details (in the case that we need to contact you regarding an order placed), and your account authentication details. To keep your information secure and to minimise the risk of unauthorised access to your account/information, we stress that you do not disclose your account login details to any third persons besides yourself.

To further secure your account, we employ a non-recoverable encryption technology to encode your authentication data on our server. Also, it is our obligation to keep other information about you if it is necessary for us to do so to comply with the law.

**How we collect information about you**

* When you create an account with us.
* Information collected during your activities on our web site (ie. When making purchases, making support queries, etc).
* Through online surveys, questionaires, and information collected from competition or promotion entries.

**How long do we keep your information?**

Your information is stored indefinitely as long as your account with Kikatek is active. In the case that you wish to close your account, you may request your information to be removed from our database. Please contact us via our e-Ticket Support System if this applies to you. Certain sensitive data such as credit card details are **never** stored in our database. They are treated as transient data, and their transmissions are always protected through the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology.

**Maintaining the information we hold for you**

You have full control over the information we hold about you. These information can be accessed and amended through the [My Account](https://secure.kikatek.com/account.php) section at anytime. From there, you can also amend certain opt-in features such as subscription to the Kikatek newsletter.

You can request details of all the information Kikatek currently holds about you in its database(excluding anonymously collected data) again, via our e-Ticket Support System. Please be advise that the charge for this service is GBP10.00 for each request. Once your request is received, our representative will advise you on the required procedures.

**Secured Shopping Guarantee**

We at Kikatek take the security of your information seriously, that is why we have implemented technology and security policies, procedures and measures to protect the personal information we store on behalf of our customers, from unauthorised access, misuse, alteration, and loss.

**Secured server communications**

All sensitive data transmission to and from our secure server is protected by whats known as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 128 bit encryption which is the strongest commercial encryption available. In the unlikely case the information is intercepted, it will remain unusable as the data remains encrypted and scrambled. With this security, you can transmit your credit card details to us without risk of interception. In fact, SSL security makes shopping over the Internet much safer than shopping by telephone. As an additional security measure, no record of sensitive data, such as credit card number, is ever stored in our database. Hence, no unauthorised person can ever retrieve your card details from our secured website.

**What you can do to reinforce security of your information**

* Use a strong password - _Do not use password that can be easily deduced by others, such as names, telephone numbers, birthdays etc._
* Never disclose your password - _It is important that you do not disclose your password to any third party. If you are concerned that somebody else knows your password, you may alter your password anytime in the[My Account](https://secure.kikatek.com/account.php) section of the website. Changing your password from time to time is also a good practice._
* Download and install a secure internet browser - _Encryption is the process through which sensitive information is scrambled before it is transmitted so that it remains private even if it is intercepted. 128-bit encryption is the strongest encryption currently available, but not all browser versions support it. Recommended browsers that support 128-bit encryption are:[Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox), [Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.5 or later versions](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx), and [Netscape Navigator version 6 or later versions](http://www.netscape.com/)._
