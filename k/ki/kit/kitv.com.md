# KITV4 - Privacy Policy

This site complies with the following Privacy Policy. We can be reached by e-mail at [General Manager](mailto:mike@kitv.com).

This site collects no personally identifying information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. In addition, we may place a "cookie" in the browser files of a user's computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information although it will enable us to relate a user's use of our sites to information that the user has specifically and knowingly provided to us.

A user's personally identifying information may be used for editorial purposes and we may also use such information for marketing and promotional purposes and may share the information with others if the user has not advised us of his or her preference not to be included in such an exchange. Individuals always have the ability to stop their information being used for such purposes by sending an e-mail request to us at the address given above.

While we will seek to require third parties with whom we have agreements to follow appropriate privacy policies, we do not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of third parties.

Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on the bulletin boards or in the chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties.

Children should ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to us or anyone else over the Internet.

NOTE: You must be thirteen (13) years of age or older to sign up for our ENEWSNOTIFIER Service. Parents or guardians may register on behalf of their children in order to allow them to receive e-mail updates from KITV4NEWS.

Users can send e-mail to us at [Mike Rosenberg](mailto:mike@kitv.com) with any further questions.
