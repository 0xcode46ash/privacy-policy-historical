* * *

Kit CRM Inc. and its affiliates (“Kit”) are committed to protecting the privacy of all individuals who: 

  * visit Kit’s website located at kitcrm.com, which includes all subdomains, present and future (the “Website”); 
  

  * use the Kit services including Test Drive Kit, Starter Kit, Small Kit, Large Kit and other Kit products and services (the "Platforms"). 



To make this policy easier to read, we call the Website, the Applications and the Platforms together the "Services". 

It is Kit’s policy to respect your privacy and the privacy of all users of the Services. This Privacy Policy has been established to help you understand our commitment to protecting your privacy and personal data, and the steps we take to ensure it. By visiting and/or using any of the Services, you agree to be bound by the terms of the present Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”). Where the present Privacy Policy refers to “Kit”, it may refer to the Services or to Kit CRM Inc., depending on the context. 

Kit reserves the right, at any time, to modify or replace the Privacy Policy. Please check the Privacy Policy periodically for changes, though we will also notify you via email or other direct electronic communication method of any changes that, in our sole discretion, materially impact your use of the Services or the treatment of your Personal Information. Your use of the Services following the posting of any changes to the Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance of those changes. 

Kit’s Privacy Policy forms part of its wider terms of service. Both the Terms and the Privacy Policy apply to your use of the Services. Unless otherwise indicated, all defined terms in this Privacy Policy shall have the same meaning as in the Terms. 

##  About this Privacy Policy 

This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) and other non-identifiable information gathered by Kit when you are using or accessing the Services. 

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of any third-party services such as Facebook or Twitter that you elect to access through the Platforms (the “Supported Platforms”) or to any applications developed by third parties that Kit does not own or control (“Third-Party Apps”) or to any third parties who use the Kit Application Programming Interface (API) to perform any function related to the Platforms. As an example, the Privacy Policy does not cover any information or other content you can view via the Services on Supported Platforms (but which was not posted there using the Services) or information you provide to Third-Party Apps accessed via the Services. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Supported Platforms and Third-Party Apps that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of any Supported Platforms or Third-Party Apps. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Supported Platforms or Third-Party Apps you access via the Services. 

##  Personal information we may collect and use 

i)Registration and Logged-in Users 

When you first register for a Kit account we collect some personal information about you such as:   


  * your full name, username, and email address 
  * your password, in connection with your account and your log-in facility 
  * the geographic area where you use your computer and mobile devices 
  * other optional information as part of your account profile 



When creating a Starter Kit, Small Kit and Large Kit account, we collect your credit card information, billing address, and such other information as is required to complete a commercial transaction on our site. 

As a registered user of Kit, we may also collect the following: 

  * information you post in the form of messages, conversations, or contributions to discussions exchanged over the Supported Platforms 
  * images or other files that you may publish 



Kit uses the collected information for the following general purposes: 

  * to identify you when you log in to your account 
  * to enable us to provide the Services to you 
  * to verify transactions you make and for billing, security, and authentication 
  * to analyze the Website , Services and our visitors, including research into our user demographics and user behaviour in order to improve our content and Services 
  * to contact you about your account and provide support 
  * to share aggregate (non-identifiable) statistics about users of our Services to prospective advertisers and partners 
  * to keep you informed of information about our Services we think you may find useful or which you have requested from us, provided you have indicated you would like to be contacted for these purposes 



By submitting information to Kit when registering, you consent to the use of your information for these purposes. 

ii) Collection of Personal Information Submitted Voluntarily (Enterprise and Pro users) 

Kit may gather Personal Information about organizational representatives via various methods (phone, email, online forms, in-person meetings) but only if such Personal Information is submitted voluntarily. Kit may use such Personal Information for sales, marketing, and support of the Services. This Personal Information is never shared with third parties. 

##  System and device information 

Kit automatically collects and receives certain information from your computer or mobile device, including the activities you perform on our Website, the Platforms, and the Applications, the type of hardware and software you are using (for example, your operating system or browser), and information obtained from cookies (see “Cookies and Related Technologies” below). For example, each time you visit the Website or otherwise use the Services, we automatically collect your IP address, browser and device type, access times, the web page from which you came, the regions from which you navigate the web page, and the web page(s) you access (as applicable) (collectively referred to as “traffic data”). We may link this traffic data to your unique Kit user ID to better understand your needs and the needs of users in the aggregate, diagnose problems, analyze trends, provide services, improve the features and usability of our Services, and better understand and market to our customers and website users. 

Kit also makes use of non-identifiable information gathered for statistical purposes to keep track of the number of visits to the Services and Website pages with a view to introducing improvements and improve usability of our Services. This also includes where Kit tracks certain metrics such as clicks on URLs that have been shortened via use of the Ow.ly service. We may share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use our Services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal experience. Your IP address and other relevant non-identifiable information may be used in order to trace any fraudulent or criminal activity or any activity in violation of the Terms. 

##  When we may share Personal Information 

Except as provided in the next paragraphs and elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, Kit does not divulge any Personal Information gathered via the Services to third parties. 

Notwithstanding anything in the Privacy Policy to the contrary, we may share any information we have collected about you or that you have submitted: 

(1) when you explicitly consent to the disclosure of such information to a third party when connecting to a third-party service that asks you if you consent to such sharing; 

(2) where we are legally required to do so, such as in response to court orders or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or to defend against legal claims or demands; 

(3) if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the rights, property, or personal safety of any person; 

(4) if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding situations that involve abuse of the Services infrastructure or the Internet in general (such as voluminous spamming, denial of service attacks, or attempts to compromise the security of the Website infrastructure or the Services generally); 

(5) to a parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with Kit; 

(6) if we are acquired by or merged with another entity (in which case we will require such entity to assume our obligations under this Privacy Policy or inform you that you are covered by a new privacy policy); and 

(7) if this information is not private, is aggregated or is otherwise non-personal information, such as your public user profile information and related public data (such as Tweets, likes, etc.) or the number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did so). 

Subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy, we may also disclose information to our affiliates, agents, contractors, and service providers in order to facilitate the functioning of the Services or to perform tasks that are integral to the Services, such as processing transactions, fulfilling requests for information, or providing support services or other tasks, from time to time. Information may also be transferred from Kit to the third parties in control of the Supported Platforms, but only to the extent required in order for the Services to function properly. 

##  Information storage and international transfers 

Kit aligns itself with the Safe Harbor privacy principles as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, storage, use, transfer and other processing of Personal Data transferred from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland to the United States. While Kit itself is not certified by the US Department of Commerce, the information that you submit via the Services is hosted on secure servers by Amazon Web Services located in the United States that are certified under the Safe Harbor Scheme for transfers of Personal Information outside the European Economic Area. Safe Harbor is an EU-recognized program that provides a way for US businesses to demonstrate that they provide adequate protection for personal information transferred to it according to EU data protection standards. Further information on Safe Harbor is available from the US Department of Commerce's website. 

##  Email preferences 

Kit uses email as the primary mode of communications with our users. We want to respect your privacy by only sending emails of interest to you. You can manage your email preferences, such as opting-out or unsubscribing from emails sent by Kit, by adjusting your preferences in your account settings. You may also opt out or unsubscribe from any future email communications from within a link provided in each email correspondence that we send you.

### Twilio Short Code Privacy Policy

The Kit application and the associated Kit website available at https://www.kitcrm.com (“Kit”) are owned and operated by Kit ("us" "we" or "our"). This Kit privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any information you submit to us through Kit. This includes "Personal Information," which is information about you that is personally identifiable such as your name, e-mail address, user ID number, and other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing, as well as "Anonymous Information," which is information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information and does not permit the identification of individual persons. 

#### User Consent

By accessing or otherwise using Kit, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and the associated Terms of Service (set forth on [terms of service](https://web.archive.org/tos)) you expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Information and Anonymous Information according to this Privacy Policy. Your Personal Information may be processed by us in the country where it was collected as well as other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country. Regarding Children Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use Kit and we do not intentionally collect or maintain Personal Information from those who are under 13 years old. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. Thus, if we obtain actual knowledge that a user is under 13, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information from our databases. We recommend that children between the ages of 13 and 18 obtain their parent's permission before submitting information over the internet. By using Kit, you are representing that you are at least 18 years old, or that you are at least 13 years old and have your parents' permission to use Kit. Collection and Use of Information 

#### Personal Information

In general, we collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily through Kit. We also collect information that you submit in the process of creating or editing your account and user profile on Kit. For example, our registration and login process requires you to provide us with your name, valid email address and password of your choice. When you personalize your profile and use the features of Kit, we will collect any information you voluntarily provide, and we may also request optional information to support your use of Kit, such as your year of birth, gender and other demographic information. We collect information in the form of the content that you submit during your use of Kit, such as photos, comments, ratings and other information you choose to submit. We may also collect information about you and your friends, from any social network you may have connected from, in order to provide you with a more personalized experience. For instance, we may collect your user ID or profile information that you have permitted to be displayed through Kit in order to display you as a friend or in association with your profile and collections. When you order our products or services, you will need to submit your credit card or other payment information so that our service providers can process your payment for those products and services. If you choose to sign up to receive information about products or services that may be of interest to you, we will collect your email address and all related information.

We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources with which you have registered, companies who we have partnered with (collectively, "Partners") or other third parties. We may associate this information with the other Personal Information we have collected about you. 

#### E-mail and E-mail Addresses

We may use and display your full name and email address when you send an email notification to a friend through Kit or the social network from which you have connected to Kit (such as in an invitation, or when sharing your content).

#### Information Collected Via Technology

As you use Kit, certain information may also be passively collected and stored on our or our service providers' server logs, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system. We also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed, or on which of the advertisements displayed on Kit you clicked. This type of information is collected to make Kit and solutions more useful to you and to tailor the experience with Kit to meet your special interests and needs. An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. For example, we, or our service providers, may track your IP Address when you access Kit to assist with ad targeting. 

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with Kit. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. In order to use our services offered through Kit, your web browser must accept Cookies. If you choose to disable Cookies, some aspects of Kit may not work properly, and you will not be able to receive our services. We may also enable advertisers and ad servers to promote third-party products and/or services by placing advertisements on Kit. These advertisers and ad servers may use Cookies and/or "Web Beacons" (which are usually small, transparent graphic images) in order to monitor information related to served advertisements. Clicking on such advertisements will direct you to the website of a third-party and the advertiser. This Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of any advertisers or ad servers.
