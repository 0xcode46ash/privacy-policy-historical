Kit CRM Inc. and its affiliates (“Kit”) are committed to protecting the privacy of all individuals who: 

  * visit Kit’s website located at kitcrm.com, which includes all subdomains, present and future (the “Website”); 
  

  * use the Kit services including Test Drive Kit, Starter Kit, Small Kit, Large Kit and other Kit products and services (the "Platforms"). 



To make this policy easier to read, we call the Website, the Applications and the Platforms together the "Services". 

It is Kit’s policy to respect your privacy and the privacy of all users of the Services. This Privacy Policy has been established to help you understand our commitment to protecting your privacy and personal data, and the steps we take to ensure it. By visiting and/or using any of the Services, you agree to be bound by the terms of the present Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”). Where the present Privacy Policy refers to “Kit”, it may refer to the Services or to Kit CRM Inc., depending on the context. 

Kit reserves the right, at any time, to modify or replace the Privacy Policy. Please check the Privacy Policy periodically for changes, though we will also notify you via email or other direct electronic communication method of any changes that, in our sole discretion, materially impact your use of the Services or the treatment of your Personal Information. Your use of the Services following the posting of any changes to the Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance of those changes. 

Kit’s Privacy Policy forms part of its wider terms of service. Both the Terms and the Privacy Policy apply to your use of the Services. Unless otherwise indicated, all defined terms in this Privacy Policy shall have the same meaning as in the Terms. 

##  About this Privacy Policy 

This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) and other non-identifiable information gathered by Kit when you are using or accessing the Services. 

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of any third-party services such as Facebook or Twitter that you elect to access through the Platforms (the “Supported Platforms”) or to any applications developed by third parties that Kit does not own or control (“Third-Party Apps”) or to any third parties who use the Kit Application Programming Interface (API) to perform any function related to the Platforms. As an example, the Privacy Policy does not cover any information or other content you can view via the Services on Supported Platforms (but which was not posted there using the Services) or information you provide to Third-Party Apps accessed via the Services. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Supported Platforms and Third-Party Apps that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of any Supported Platforms or Third-Party Apps. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Supported Platforms or Third-Party Apps you access via the Services. 

##  Personal information we may collect and use 

i)Registration and Logged-in Users 

When you first register for a Kit account we collect some personal information about you such as:

By submitting information to Kit when registering, you consent to the use of your information for these purposes. 

ii) Collection of Personal Information Submitted Voluntarily (Enterprise and Pro users) 

Kit may gather Personal Information about organizational representatives via various methods (phone, email, online forms, in-person meetings) but only if such Personal Information is submitted voluntarily. Kit may use such Personal Information for sales, marketing, and support of the Services. This Personal Information is never shared with third parties. 

##  System and device information 

Kit automatically collects and receives certain information from your computer or mobile device, including the activities you perform on our Website, the Platforms, and the Applications, the type of hardware and software you are using (for example, your operating system or browser), and information obtained from cookies (see “Cookies and Related Technologies” below). For example, each time you visit the Website or otherwise use the Services, we automatically collect your IP address, browser and device type, access times, the web page from which you came, the regions from which you navigate the web page, and the web page(s) you access (as applicable) (collectively referred to as “traffic data”). We may link this traffic data to your unique Kit user ID to better understand your needs and the needs of users in the aggregate, diagnose problems, analyze trends, provide services, improve the features and usability of our Services, and better understand and market to our customers and website users. 

Kit also makes use of non-identifiable information gathered for statistical purposes to keep track of the number of visits to the Services and Website pages with a view to introducing improvements and improve usability of our Services. This also includes where Kit tracks certain metrics such as clicks on URLs that have been shortened via use of the Ow.ly service. We may share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use our Services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal experience. Your IP address and other relevant non-identifiable information may be used in order to trace any fraudulent or criminal activity or any activity in violation of the Terms. 

##  When we may share Personal Information 

Except as provided in the next paragraphs and elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, Kit does not divulge any Personal Information gathered via the Services to third parties. 

Notwithstanding anything in the Privacy Policy to the contrary, we may share any information we have collected about you or that you have submitted: 

(1) when you explicitly consent to the disclosure of such information to a third party when connecting to a third-party service that asks you if you consent to such sharing; 

(2) where we are legally required to do so, such as in response to court orders or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or to defend against legal claims or demands; 

(3) if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the rights, property, or personal safety of any person; 

(4) if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding situations that involve abuse of the Services infrastructure or the Internet in general (such as voluminous spamming, denial of service attacks, or attempts to compromise the security of the Website infrastructure or the Services generally); 

(5) to a parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with Kit; 

(6) if we are acquired by or merged with another entity (in which case we will require such entity to assume our obligations under this Privacy Policy or inform you that you are covered by a new privacy policy); and 

(7) if this information is not private, is aggregated or is otherwise non-personal information, such as your public user profile information and related public data (such as Tweets, likes, etc.) or the number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did so). 

Subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy, we may also disclose information to our affiliates, agents, contractors, and service providers in order to facilitate the functioning of the Services or to perform tasks that are integral to the Services, such as processing transactions, fulfilling requests for information, or providing support services or other tasks, from time to time. Information may also be transferred from Kit to the third parties in control of the Supported Platforms, but only to the extent required in order for the Services to function properly. 

##  Information storage and international transfers 

Kit aligns itself with the Safe Harbor privacy principles as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, storage, use, transfer and other processing of Personal Data transferred from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland to the United States. While Kit itself is not certified by the US Department of Commerce, the information that you submit via the Services is hosted on secure servers by Amazon Web Services located in the United States that are certified under the Safe Harbor Scheme for transfers of Personal Information outside the European Economic Area. Safe Harbor is an EU-recognized program that provides a way for US businesses to demonstrate that they provide adequate protection for personal information transferred to it according to EU data protection standards. Further information on Safe Harbor is available from the US Department of Commerce's website. 

##  Email preferences 

Kit uses email as the primary mode of communications with our users. We want to respect your privacy by only sending emails of interest to you.
