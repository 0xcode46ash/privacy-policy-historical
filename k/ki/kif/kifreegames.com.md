# Privacy Policy | Play Free Games from KingsIsle Entertainment, Inc.

KingsIsle Entertainment, Inc. is committed to protecting and safeguarding consumer privacy on the Internet, especially for children. This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes how we handle the personal information provided to us on this website and collected through the in-game play of the Wizard101 environment (collectively “Site”), accessible from [www.Wizard101.com](https://www.wizard101.com/). 

Please be sure to read this Privacy Policy before using this Site or submitting information to us. Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time and your continued use of this Site constitutes acceptance of such changes, so please check this area periodically for updates to this Privacy Policy. 

KingsIsle is very sensitive to privacy issues with respect to children, especially those under the age of 13. Please see below for more information on how KingsIsle addresses children’s privacy issues generally and under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). We encourage parents to regularly monitor and supervise their children’s on-line activities. 

INFORMATION KINGSISLE COLLECTS FROM YOU 

KingsIsle may collect information through your active submission of information or passively through use of automated technologies. Please note: see the Section below titled “Special Notes About Information From Children” for the process we use to limit information collected from children under the age of the 13. 

Active Information Collection   
Much of the personally identifiable information we collect from our visitors is submitted by visitors in response to our requests, such as during the registration process, or in response to polls, forums, promotional offers or other interactivity incorporated into the site. From time-to-time, visitors may also submit personally identifiable information directly to us via e-mail. The information we actively collect includes some or all of the following: 

\-- Name   
\-- Date of Birth   
\-- Address (including City, State, Country and/or Zip Code)   
\-- E-Mail Address   
\-- Username   
\-- Password   
\-- Gender   
\-- Information Regarding Your Computer Hardware and Network Connectivity 

During the registration process, we will also collect your parent’s or guardian’s e-mail address from you if you are under the age of 13 or if you elect to set up a parental account. Establishment of a parental account may also require submission of the information described in this Section with respect to the parent(s) or guardian(s). 

Finally, we may require you to submit billing information to pay any fees applicable to participation in the Site. Depending on the type of payment method, this billing information may include credit card or comparable payment account number, billing address, name on card/account, expiration date and security code. 

For some of our online activities - such as polls or surveys - we may ask users to provide information that is not personally identifiable, such as country of residence, favorite color or feedback or suggestions for the Site. 

Passive Information Collection   
As you navigate through the Site and participate in the Wizard101 environment, other information may be collected through use of technologies which are common among websites and online environments. For example, we currently track IP addresses, use session cookies, and evaluate access time and navigational data in connection with the Site. “Cookies” are small pieces of information or files that a website puts on your computer which allow KingsIsle to accumulate data on your navigation of the website and ease such navigation (e.g., by allowing your computer to save your Username and Password). Within the Wizard101 environment, we may also collect information on your in-game activities, character development and character interaction. 

In addition to our active information collection efforts, we may also use technology to passively gather operational information about the technology you use, such as your browser, type of computer, operating systems and Internet service providers. 

HOW KINGSISLE USES YOUR INFORMATION 

KingsIsle uses your personal information to enable you to register for the Site. We also use this information to manage your use of the Site and support operation of the Site generally. We use any billing information you provide to collect any fees due in connection with your use of the Site. We may also use your personal information to send you updates and information about the Site and KingsIsle’s products and services. 

Although we do not generally give your personal information to third parties, we may disclose your information to KingsIsle’s vendors that provide technical support or other services to KingsIsle related to the Site. For example, we may provide your information to companies that host the Site or process credit card information. However, these vendors may not use your information for any reason other than assisting KingsIsle and are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information. 

We reserve the right to disclose information if required to do so by law or by a regulatory authority. We may also disclose your information as part of an investigation or enforcement action relating to improper or illegal conduct in connection with our Site. 

If a third party acquires the assets of KingsIsle related to the Site and its products and services (whether by sale, merger, change of control, bankruptcy or otherwise), your information may be transferred to the new owner(s). In such case, your information would remain subject to the provisions of the privacy policy that was applicable to your information immediately prior to the transfer. 

KingsIsle may maintain aggregate data or other non-personally identifiable information about our users, such as usage statistics, online traffic patterns and user feedback. In addition to using this information to support operation of the Site, KingsIsle may disclose this information to third parties without restriction. 

SPECIAL NOTES ABOUT INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN 

Children Generally 

On our Site, we offer many features, such as the ability to view or download game content or images, news, or participate in forums, which do not require a child to provide any personal information. KingsIsle will not condition a child’s participation in any online activity on the child’s disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity. We also may enable users to chat online through our Site, but we take measures to limit users’ ability to communicate personal information through this chat function. 

Children Under the Age of 13 

During the registration process, we collect only limited personal information from children identified as under 13 years of age (such as username and password) as well as an e-mail address or other contact information for a parent or guardian. We obtain this information so that we can notify the parent or guardian and obtain his or her electronic consent prior to completing the registration process and collecting more personal information. We will not knowingly collect more detailed information from a child younger than 13, such as a postal address or a telephone number, without the consent of a parent or guardian. 

Parental Review of Personally Identifiable Information 

In certain circumstances, parents will have the ability to set up parental accounts to administer their children’s accounts and review the personally identifiable information maintained by KingsIsle from such accounts. If a child is under the age of 13, the child will be required to submit an e-mail address for a parent or guardian and such individual will have the opportunity to set up a parental account. Alternatively, parents or guardians may establish a parental account during the initial registration process for the child’s account or, subsequently, through the account management features applicable to the child’s account. Although a child over the age of 13 may register without the electronic consent of a parent or guardian, a parent or guardian may also submit a request to KingsIsle at the contact information below to review any personally identifiable information from such child. However, such requests will be subject to the parent or guardian demonstrating proper identification to KingsIsle’s satisfaction after reasonable investigation. 

CHOICES YOU HAVE ABOUT HOW KINGSISLE USES YOUR INFORMATION 

You have the following choices regarding the personally identifiable information you provide for KingsIsle to use: 

You may send us an e-mail message at [Privacy@Wizard101.com](mailto:Privacy@Wizard101.com) to request access to review, correct or delete any personally identifiable information maintained on our systems that you or your child has provided to us through the Site registration process or other request. To protect your privacy, we will respond only to e-mail messages sent from the e-mail account that you specified (or was given by your child) during the account registration process. 

You may also opt out of receiving newsletters and other promotional materials from KingsIsle by notifying us at [Privacy@Wizard101.com](mailto:Privacy@Wizard101.com). 

If you do not wish us to collect cookies, you may set your browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you do so, please note that some parts of this Site may then be inaccessible or not function properly. 

HOW KINGSISLE PROTECTS YOUR INFORMATION   
We work hard to protect your personal information. We use both technical and procedural methods to maintain the integrity and security of our databases, including giving users a unique user name and password for access to the Site, SSL encryption for data transfer, firewalls, and restricted access to data. 

However, the safety and security of your information also depends on you. You should never share your password with anyone else and you should always logoff before leaving your computer. If you believe someone has unauthorized access to your password or account, please contact us promptly. 

This Site may contain links to other websites operated by third parties that may be of interest to you. When you follow a link and leave this Site, you do so at your own risk because we do not control such third party websites.

EFFECTIVE DATE; CHANGES   
This Privacy Policy is effective as of May 19, 2008 and applies to all information previously obtained by KingsIsle. KingsIsle reserves the right to change its privacy policy in its sole discretion. In such case, KingsIsle will post the new privacy policy on the Site and the effective date of the new privacy policy will be clearly marked. With respect to children under the age of 13, KingsIsle will not use personally identifiable information from such children in ways that are materially different from this version of the Privacy Policy unless the parent(s) or guardian(s) are notified of, and consent to, the new changes to the privacy policy.

Among other things, the Terms of Use establishes disclaimers of warranties, limitations on KingsIsle’s liability, choice of law and venue, and restrictions on your use of the Site.
