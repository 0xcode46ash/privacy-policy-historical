The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to tell you what type of personal information we collect, how we may use that personal information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the opportunities you have to access and correct the information we hold.

We encourage you to check the Australian Radio Network Privacy Statement regularly as this Privacy Statement may change from time to time.

Please take some time to read through this statement and understand our position on privacy.

##### 1\. OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY

Aside from the contents of this statement, the conduct of the Australian Radio Network is governed by the Privacy Act 1988 and in particular the following Australian Privacy Principles.

##### 2\. AUSTRALIAN PRIVACY PRINCIPLES

**2.1 Principle 1: Openness**

The Australian Radio Network has clearly expressed policies on its management of personal information and these will continue to be readily available.

**2.2 Principle 2: Anonymity**

Whenever it is lawful and practicable, individuals will have the option of not identifying themselves when dealing with the Australian Radio Network.

**2.3 Principle 3: Collection of Solicited Information**

Personal information will only be collected to the extent necessary, by lawful and fair means, and for specified purposes which are relevant to the operations of the Australian Radio Network.

Generally, we collect personal information directly from you when you provide it to us (for example by telephone or in an application form). In some circumstances, we may also collect personal information indirectly (including from our contractors, suppliers and other service providers and from publicly available sources). We will only do so where permitted by law.

We will not collect sensitive information (such as information relating to race, sexual orientation or any disabilities) unless you have consented to the collection of information or the collection is authorised or required by law. Please note that by submitting sensitive information you are consenting to the collection of that information.

**2.4 Principle 4: Collection of Unsolicited Information**

If we receive unsolicited personal information, the collection of which is not reasonably necessary for one of our functions or activities, we will destroy or de-identify the information as soon as practicable, unless it is unlawful or unreasonable for us to do so.

**2.5 Principle 5: Notification of the Collection of Information**

We will take reasonable steps to let individuals know, generally, what sort of personal information we hold, for what purposes, and how we collect, use and disclose that information. Where it is reasonable to do so, we will take such steps at the time of collection of the personal information or as soon as reasonably practicable after that time.

**2.6 Principle 6: Use and disclosure of information**

Personal information will only be used for:

  * (a) a purpose for which it was collected or for a reasonably expected related purpose and, where the personal information is sensitive information, the purpose is directly related to the purpose of collection;
  * (b) the derivation of anonymous or aggregated information;
  * (c) the prevention or lessening of a threat to the life or health of the individual concerned or another person;
  * (d) purposes permitted, required or authorised by or under law;
  * (e) the enforcement of the criminal law or of a law imposing a pecuniary penalty or for the protection of public revenue, where the use is reasonably necessary, or;
  * (f) any other purpose, where the person concerned has consented to its use for that purpose.



Personal information will not be disclosed to a third party unless:

  * (a) the person concerned has consented to the disclosure;
  * (b) it is the usual practice of the Australian Radio Network to pass information to a third party and the individual from whom the information was collected was notified of this practice at the time of collection (unless it is sensitive information);
  * (c) there are reasonable grounds to believe that disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a threat to the life or health of the individual concerned or another person;
  * (d) the disclosure is permitted, required or authorised by or under law; or
  * (e) the disclosure is reasonably necessary for the enforcement of the criminal law or a law imposing a pecuniary penalty, or for the protection of public revenue.



**2.7 Principle 7: Direct Marketing**

We may only use sensitive information for direct marketing if the individual has consented. In general terms, we may only use other personal information that is not sensitive information for direct marketing if:

  * (a) the individual has consented to us using their personal information for direct marketing; or
  * (b) the individual would reasonably expect us to use their personal information for direct marketing; or
  * (c) it is impracticable to obtain the individual’s consent; and
  * (d) the individual has not opted out from receiving direct marketing from us.



If you do not wish your personal information to be used or disclosed by us for the purposes of direct marketing please contact us. It may take up to 14 days for your request to be processed.

**2.8 Principle 8: Cross-border disclosure of personal information**

On occasion, the Australian Radio Network may disclose personal information to recipients in New Zealand and the United States of America. The Australian Radio Network will not do so unless:

  * (a) the Australian Radio Network has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the information which it has transferred will not be collected, held, used or disclosed by the recipient of the information inconsistently with these rules; or
  * (b) the Australian Radio Network reasonably believes that the recipient of the information is subject to a law or binding scheme which has the effect of protecting the information in a way that is substantially similar to the Australian Privacy Principles and that there are mechanisms that the individual can access to enforce that protection; or
  * (c) the individual concerned consents to the disclosure after being expressly informed that the overseas recipient is not bound to protect the personal information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles or any substantially similar regime; or
  * (d) the disclosure is required or authorised by Australian law; or
  * (e) a “permitted general situation” exists. That is, the disclosure is necessary: 
    * (i) to lessen or prevent a serious threat to life, health or safety;
    * (ii) to take appropriate action in relation to suspected unlawful activity or serious misconduct;
    * (iii) to locate a person reported as missing;
    * (iv) for a diplomatic or consular function or activity; or
    * (v) for certain Defence Force activities outside Australia); or
  * (f) the disclosure is required or authorised under an international agreement relating to information sharing; or
  * (g) the disclosure is required for an enforcement related activity.



**2.9 Principle 9: Identifiers**

The Australian Radio Network will not adopt as its own identifier an identifier that has been assigned by a government agency (or by an agent of, or contractor to, a government agency acting in its capacity as agent or contractor).

**2.10 Principle 10: quality of personal information**

Prior to the use and disclosure of personal information, where reasonable to do so, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is relevant, accurate, complete and up to date for the purpose for which it is to be used.

**2.11 Principle 11: security of personal information**

Reasonable steps will be taken to protect personal information we hold against misuse, interference, loss, unauthorised access, alteration, destruction or disclosure. We maintain computer and network security by using firewalls, user identifiers and passwords to control access to our computer system. All attempts will be made to destroy or de-identify personal information if it is no longer needed.

**2.12 Principle 12: Access to information**

Where the Australian Radio Network holds personal information about an individual, it will provide the individual with access to the information on request, in a form or manner suitable to the individual's reasonable needs, except to the extent that:

  * (a) providing access would pose a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of any individual; or
  * (b) providing access would have an unreasonable impact upon the privacy of other individuals; or
  * (c) the request for access is frivolous or vexatious; or
  * (d) the information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings between the Australian Radio Network and the individual, and the information would not be accessible by the process of discovery in those proceedings; or
  * (e) providing access would reveal the intentions of the Australian Radio Network in relation to negotiations with the individual in such a way as to prejudice those negotiations; or
  * (f) providing access would be unlawful; or
  * (g) denying access is specifically authorised by law; or
  * (h) providing access would be likely to prejudice an investigation of possible unlawful activity; or
  * (i) providing access would be likely to prejudice: 
    * (i) the prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution or punishment of criminal offences; or
    * (ii) breaches of a law imposing a penalty or sanction
    * (iii) the enforcement of laws relating to the confiscation of the proceeds of crime;
    * (iv) the protection of the public revenue;
    * (v) the prevention, detection, investigation or remedying of seriously improper conduct; or
    * (vi) preparation for, or conduct of, proceedings before any court or tribunal, or implementation of its orders; by or on behalf of an enforcement agency; or
    * (vii) an enforcement agency performing a lawful security function asks Australian Radio Network not to provide access on the basis that providing access would be likely to cause damage to the national security of Australia.



Where providing access would reveal evaluative information generated within the Australian Radio Network in connection with a commercially sensitive decision-making process, the Australian Radio Network may give the individual an explanation for the decision, rather than direct access to the information.

Wherever direct access by the individual is impractical or inappropriate, the Australian Radio Network and the individual should consider whether the use of mutually agreed intermediaries would allow sufficient access to meet the needs of both parties.

If the Australian Radio Network levies charges for providing access to personal information, those charges:

  * (a) will not be excessive; and
  * (b) will not apply to lodging a request for access.



**2.13 Principle 13: Correction of Information**

If the Australian Radio Network holds personal information about an individual and the individual is able to establish, or the Australian Radio Network otherwise concludes, that the information is not accurate, complete and up-to-date, the Australian Radio Network will take reasonable steps to correct the information so that it is accurate, complete and up-to-date.

If the individual and the Australian Radio Network disagree about whether the information is accurate, complete and up-to-date, and the individual asks the Australian Radio Network to associate with the information a statement claiming that the information is not accurate, complete or up-to-date, the Australian Radio Network will take reasonable steps to do so.

The Australian Radio Network will provide reasons for denial of access or correction.
