#### Khmer.be does not send Spam or sell email addresses.

### About Khmer.be and the Information We Collect

Khmer.be is an online social networking community that connects people through networks of friends for communicating, sharing and making new friends. To accomplish this, each Khmer.be Member creates his or her own profile, which contains the personal information that the Member chooses to include. This personal information includes such things as:

* First name or first and last names of the Member (depending on the options selected by the Member), Gender, age, martial status and other, similar personal information, Occupation, Location (e.g., city and state), and Photos, videos or other shared content uploaded by the Member to his or her profile, to the extent that it includes personal information.

Khmer.be also collects Member-submitted account information such as name and email address, to identify Members and send notifications related to the use of the Khmer.be service.

You should also be aware that Members may reveal other personal information while communicating on other areas of the Khmer.be website, such as while participating in discussions on Khmer.be Groups and/or posting information on Khmer.be Forums. This information, in turn, might be viewed by other Members or visitors to the Khmer.be website who are not Members.

Finally, we also collect some information from Members, as well as from other visitors to the Khmer.be website, that is not personally identifiable, such as browser type and IP address. This information is gathered from all Members and visitors to the website.

### Use of Information Obtained by Khmer.be

The personal information of a Member contained in his or her profile will be shown to those people whom the Member chooses. Each Member has three options when choosing the level of sharing of his or her profile. They are:

* "Friends" which consists only of that Member's friends,
* "Friends of Friends" which consists of that Member's friends, as well as the extended group of people who are friends of that Member's friends, and
* "Anyone" which is all visitors to the Khmer.be website, whether or not they are Khmer.be members.

**PLEASE NOTE THAT, REGARDLESS OF WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION A MEMBER CHOOSES TO INCLUDE IN HIS OR HER PROFILE, OR WHAT LEVEL OF SHARING HE OR SHE CHOOSES, CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT EACH MEMBER WILL BE INCLUDED IN THAT MEMBER'S "PUBLIC PROFILE," WHICH IS AN ABBREVIATED VERSION OF A Khmer.be PROFILE. A LIST OF THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN EACH PUBLIC PROFILE CAN BE FOUND IN THE Khmer.be[TERMS OF SERVICE](http://khmer.be/data/html/terms.htm).**

Except where a Member might choose to include a full name in his or her profile, a Member's email address and full name will only be used in the following circumstances:

  * When the Member invites a friend via email to become a Khmer.be Member,
  * When the Member sends a request to another Member to add the other Member to his or her friend list,
  * When we send notifications to the Member relating to his or her use of the Khmer.be service or Khmer.be website, and
  * If the Member so chooses, when we send regular notifications, weekly updates, or other news regarding the Khmer.be service or the Khmer.be website.



Except when inviting or adding friends, a Member's email address will never be shared with or displayed to any other person. Members and their friends, and other Members within their personal networks (depending on the level of sharing a Member has chosen) communicate on Khmer.be with each other through the Khmer.be service, without disclosing email addresses.

We use information relating to the server information, IP address.

### Sharing of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks

Except as explained above, or where you are expressly informed otherwise, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information, unless required by law or for the protection of your Membership. However, Khmer.be may share profile information and aggregate usage information in a non-personally identifiable manner with advertisers and other third parties in order to present to Members and other users of the Khmer.be website more targeted advertising, products and services. In such situations we will never disclose information that would personally identify you.

### Changes in Our Privacy Policy

If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our web site so Members and other users of the Khmer.be website are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we are going to use Members' or other users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify those Members and users via email or by placing a prominent notice on our website.

### Invite a Friend

If a Member elects to use our "Invite" feature to invite a friend to become a Member of the Khmer.be service, we ask them for the friend's email address. Khmer.be will automatically send the friend an email inviting them to join the site. Khmer.be stores this email address for the purpose of automatically adding the respondent to the friends list of the Member sending the invitation, and also to send reminders of the invitation. Khmer.be will never sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders. Any person who receives an invitation may [contact Khmer.be](http://khmer.be/contact.aspx) to request the removal of this information from our database.

### Security

The Khmer.be account of every Member is password-protected. Khmer.be takes every precaution to protect the information of the Members, as well as information collected from other users of the Khmer.be website. We use industry standard measures to protect all information that is stored on our servers and within our database. We limit the access to this information to those employees who need access to perform their job function such as our customer service personnel. If you have any questions about the security at our website, please [contact us](http://khmer.be/contact.aspx).

### Email Choice/Opt-out
