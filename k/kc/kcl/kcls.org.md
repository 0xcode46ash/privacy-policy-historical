**King County Library System  
Privacy Statement**

**Web Policy**  
Thank you for visiting the King County Library System’s Web site. This Privacy Statement demonstrates the commitment of KCLS to patron security.

  King County Library Statement strives to maintain the confidentiality of patron records. It has always been against KCLS policy to share or sell Web site information. 

In order to improve the usefulness of the KCLS Web site for visitors, **anonymous** statistical information is automatically collected from usage reports that concern network traffic flow and volume. 

The information collected consists of:   
1\. Domain name and IP address of the visitor--enabling KCLS to  
   troubleshoot issues with the server.  
2\. Browser being used--enabling us to better understand local  
   market penetration so we may better design the KCLS page  
   to take full advantage of browser capabilities.  
3\. Default language set on browsers.  
4\. Usage patterns--allowing us to see what options need to  
   move closer to the top to enable users to get information as  
  quickly as possible. (The tool used to collect this data is Web  
  TrendsLive.)

To use KCLS databases **remotely** (from outside the Library), users must type in their KCLS library card number, ensuring that King County taxpayers are the only ones benefiting from this information and service. Database vendors do not have access to any user records or information.

**Catalog Policy**  
Names are purged every four days of holdings and previous activity. The information typed into the King County Library System catalog (KCLS library card number and Pin numbers) is used only for internal purposes (i.e., to process holds). KCLS takes many measures to safeguard user information, but KCLS cannot and does not guarantee that every task completed via its catalogs is private. 

**PC Privacy**  
KCLS does its best to lock down public access machines. However, KCLS cannot and does not guarantee that every task completed on PCs is private. While KCLS takes many measures to safeguard user information, it is not possible to totally secure a machine without rendering it useless. 

If you have any questions about this statement, the practices of this site, or any other questions, please contact [ webmaster@kcls.org](mailto:webmaster@kcls.org).
