Kansas City Power & Light (KCP&L) collects personally identifiable information from the users on our Web site. KCP&L and its parent holding company, Great Plains Energy, are the sole owners of the information collected on kcpl.com and AccountLink, on the secured portion of kcpl.com. 

**Registration**   
In order to use the secure portion of this Web site, where you can view account information and make transactions, you must first complete the registration form and create a user name and password. During registration you must provide contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you express interest. 

**Log Files**  
As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. 

We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. 

We sometimes link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information in order to troubleshoot problems and to provide customer support assistance to users of our Web site. 

**Cookies**  
A [cookie](https://web.archive.org/web/20090619165345id_/http%3A//www.kcpl.com/reports/cookie.html) is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We link the information we store in cookies to personally identifiable information. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. 

We set a persistent cookie to give you the option to store your user ID, so you don't have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, may be limited. 

**E-mail Preferences**   
When you register for online access to our site, you have options to indicate if there are certain types of email communications you prefer not to receive. These preferences can be changed at any time through the email options screen of our AccountLink Web site. Marketing and promotional email messages from KCP&L also contain an opt-out link which you can use to indicate your preference to stop receiving such messages. You may also contact us at [ALinfo@kcpl.com](mailto:ALinfo@kcpl.com) to update your contact preferences. 

**Uses of Information **  
Information collected through our Web site is used to provide electronic alternatives to traditional contact methods such as telephone and mail. We use your personal information to establish your identity so you can receive information and make transactions through the Web site and via email.

**Newsletters, Special Offers and Updates** We will occasionally send you information on products, services, and special deals we think may be of interest to you. You can sign up for these emails from us on our registration page or under Email Options within AccountLink. 

Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see the "Email Preferences" section.

**Customer Service**  
We will communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, according to your preference.

**Profile**  
We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and third party sources to create a profile of your preferences. We tie your personally identifiable information to information in the profile in order to provide tailored promotions and offers and to improve the content and performance of the Web site. 

We do not share your profile with third party companies or organizations other than those who are working as service providers on behalf of KCP&L or Great Plains Energy. These third parties are only permitted to use personally identifiable information for the business purposes specified by KCP&L or Great Plains Energy such as surveying, research, program promotion, and enrollment. 

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

 _Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)_

We share aggregated demographic information about our user base with some third party service providers. This information does not identify individual users. We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.

 _Personally Identifiable Information_

We never sell your personally identifiable information.

_We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process._

**Links to Other Sites** This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by KCP&L. Please be aware that we, KCP&L, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. 

We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each Web site that collects personally identifiable information. 

This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site. 

**Forums/Weblogs**  
If you post comments through a forum or blog on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. 

**Viruses**  
We use appropriate anti-virus software and take precautions to ensure that this Web site does not contain or carry viruses. However, due to the rapidly developing nature of viruses and the Internet we strongly recommend that you employ similar anti-virus software when accessing our Web site. We make no warranty that the Web site or email correspondence is completely free from such viruses.

**Controlling Spam and Unsolicited Emails**  
We are concerned about controlling unsolicited commercial email, or "spam". We will not sell, lease or rent our email subscriber lists to third parties. While we continue to actively review and implement new technology and filtering features, there is currently no technology available that will completely prevent the sending and receiving of unsolicited email. We encourage you to be cautious about sharing your email address while online and recommend employing tools such as spam filters.

**Children's Privacy**  
This Web site contains energy-related information that may be of educational interest to children. We do not intend to gather personal information online from or about children. We encourage all children and young teens to seek consent from their parents before providing any information about themselves or their households to anyone on the Internet.

**Security**  
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information on our registration forms, we encrypt that information during transmission using secure socket layer technology (SSL). 

We take prudent steps to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot absolutely guarantee its security.

For added security, we recommend that you log out when you complete an interactive session. For your protection, our system will automatically close your session after 15 minutes of inactivity.

**Changes to this Privacy Statement**  
The effective date of this policy is September 1, 2007. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, and encourage you to review it periodically. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.

**Changes to your Personally Identifiable Information**  


If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, or deactivate it by making the change through our AccountLink system or by emailing our Customer Support at ALinfo@kcpl.com or by contacting us by telephone at 816-471-5275.
