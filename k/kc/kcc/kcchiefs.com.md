The Website is owned by the Kansas City Chiefs Football Club, Inc. (the “Club”, “we”, “our”, or “us”). We have contracted with various third party service providers to operate and manage specific sections or applications of the Services on our behalf including the App, the Chiefs Pro Shop at shop.kcchiefs.com, the Chiefs Kids Club, and certain other applications or segments of the Services provided to you by the Chiefs (the “Contracted Applications”) that may provide additional privacy policies and practices with respect to information you provide through such Contracted Applications. In particular, the Chiefs Kids Club, and any information collected through the Chiefs Kids Club, is governed by a separate privacy policy as outlined below. Unless otherwise stated, we own the information collected via the Services and we may use it for our own business purposes, including marketing.

The Club has received TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy statement and our practices have been reviewed for compliance with the TRUSTe program viewable on the validation page available by clicking the TRUSTe seal.

The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site www.kcchiefs.com and does not cover information that may be collected through our mobile applications.

**Games:** When you register to play games on the Services, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information.

**Cookies:** As with many websites and apps, our Services use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a collection of information that gets stored on the hard drive of your computer when browsing the Internet. These small bits of code automatically identify your browser to the Website whenever your computer is used to visit or use the Services. Cookies automatically identify your browser to the Services whenever your device is used with the Services. Cookies also let us know how many times a user has been on certain pages and where visitors go on the Website and App. In addition, cookies can let us know non-personally identifiable information, like what web browser or operating system is being used to access the Services. For registered users, cookies can make using the Services easier for you by saving information such as your passwords or preferences. By tracking how and when you use the Services, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Services are based on data obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies allows you, among other things, to personalize your experience on the Services. Cookies may also allow the Services to present to you advertising which may be of interest to you. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, your browser should contain an option that allows you to disable or delete cookie data at any time. Some areas of the Services, however, may not provide you with a personalized experience if you have disabled the use of cookies. You can opt out of some, but not all, third-party advertiser cookies in one location at the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out website, located at [www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). You may block all browser cookies by following the instructions applicable to your browser at <http://www.aboutcookies.org/page-1>.

**Third Party Cookies:** The use of cookies by our tracking utility company, and service providers are not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our tracking utility company and service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site, in order for you to use the shopping cart, etc.

**Web beacons and Other Tracking Technology:** Our Services use a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including Web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of websites. We also use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on the Services, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of the Services. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. We also use these technical methods in HTML emails that we send to determine whether the recipients have opened those emails and/or clicked on links in those emails. The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is personally identifiable.

**Persistent Identifiers and Click-Stream Data:** We may collect persistent identifiers and/or click-stream data. Persistent identifiers include device IDs and IP addresses. A device ID is a number associate with a particular device that can identify that device across multiple visits. An IP address is a number associated with the service through which you access the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP address or device ID is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use such persistent identifiers for purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors, for example regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our sites. We may combine this information with personally identifiable information we obtain from you directly through the Services or otherwise, including from third parties.

Click-stream data is information collected by our computers when you request data from the Services. Click-stream data may include such information as the data served, the time, the source of the request, the type of device or browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal information. When analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising.

**Transaction Information:** If you conduct any transaction with the Services, such as such as ordering information, buying our products, or subscribing to programs offered through the Services, we will ask you to complete an order form that will request certain information from you, including contact information, demographic information and financial information. In some instances, we may direct you to a third party vendor site to collect this information from you directly. Even though the collection form may have the look and feel of the Website or other Services provided by the Club, please be aware you will be giving your information directly to the third party vendor, and that, generally in such instances, such third party vendor's privacy policy will govern the collection of your personal information. Please reference the privacy policies available from these pages for any privacy related concerns.

We and/or our vendor will use this information to complete the transaction that you have requested, i.e. to deliver the information, products or other services that you request or purchase, to invoice you, and in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. For your protection, financial information you provide through the Services is collected and stored through encrypted means.
