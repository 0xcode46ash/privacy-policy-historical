**COMMUNITY TELEVISION OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA (KCET)**

KCET recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information collected from its members, donors, viewers of KCET and about visitors to KCET's Website. Here we explain how KCET collects information on-line and by other methods, what we do with that information, and what controls you have. We're committed to ensuring the privacy of your personally identifiable information (such as full name, address, email address, telephone number and/or other identifiable information), protecting the security of making financial transactions and preserving the integrity of the medium. 

**Gathering and Use of Information**

1\. We will not collect personally identifiable information from you, other than what you supply to us on a voluntary basis. We may collect certain non-personal information to optimize our Web pages for your computer (i.e., the identity of your Internet browser, the type of operating system you use, your IP address and the domain name of your Internet service provider). We may use such non-personal information for internal purposes, including but not limited to improving the content of our website. 

2\. In order to participate in some activities, you might be asked to provide some personally identifiable information. This could be in connection with the following:

contest or sweepstakes registration 

subscription registration for websites 

services which require subscription (such as email or postal newsletters) 

KCET membership submission 

pledging financial support

content submissions, community postings   
(i.e., forums or bulletin boards), comments and suggestions or voting

You should recognize that if you choose not to voluntarily submit requested information, you may not be eligible for those activities for which personally identifiable information is needed. 

3\. In the event KCET wants to collect information for purposes other than those set forth in this policy, KCET will notify you when we are collecting personally identifiable information about you and how we intend to use it. 

4\. Personally identifiable information that members, donors, viewers and visitors provide to KCET or submit to our sites is used only for the purpose for which it is submitted unless we disclose other uses in this Privacy Policy or at the time of collection. Such other uses may include sending our constituents information about KCET programs, services, or membership, sending you information or materials we think you will find interesting, or sharing the information with select third party companies or organizations. 

5\. KCET maintains a membership/customer database with the email address, name and postal address, telephone number and other personally identifiable information of persons who have provided such information to KCET by mail, telephone or emailing us with questions about membership, submitting an on-line membership contribution (making an on-line pledge) or sending us an email about our programs or services. By supplying KCET with an email address, telephone number or postal address you may receive future communications from KCET via email, telephone or mail. KCET, like many non-profits, occasionally shares its postal address lists with carefully selected companies and organizations not affiliated with KCET. KCET never shares the email addresses or telephone numbers it collects with non-affiliated companies or organizations. When you become a KCET member via mail, by telephone, on-line or make an on-line contribution, your name and address will be included in this list. For more information regarding KCET's policies on the handling and use of KCET's membership/customer lists please review KCET's Membership List Management Policy. 

If, at any time, you do not wish to have your name and postal address provided to these companies or organizations, or you do not wish to receive any further information or contact from KCET, you may email KCET at [viewerservices@kcet.org](mailto:viewerservices@kcet.org), write KCET at 4401 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, California, Attn.: Member Services, or call KCET at (323) 953-KCET(5238) and request that your name and postal address be excluded from any list provided to non-affiliated companies or organizations or request that KCET not contact you or send further information. 

**KCET Kid's Privacy Policy**

KCET recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of children under 13 years of age and their personally identifiable information. Please see the KCET Kid's Privacy Policy for information regarding how and what personally identifiable information KCET collects on-line from children, what we do with that information, and what controls their parents have. KCET also believes that it is important to assist parents in supervising their children's on-line activities and, therefore, recommends that parents consider using parental control tools available from on-line services and software manufacturers that help provide a child-friendly environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing their name, address and other personally identifiable information on-line without parental permission. For additional information about parental control tools, please consult the "Customer Assistance" page of the Direct Marketing Association home page located at [www.the-dma.org](http://www.the-dma.org/). 

**Chat Rooms and Bulletin Boards**

Please remember that any information posted on bulletin boards and/or communicated in chat areas becomes public information. You should use caution when sharing information, as any of it can be collected and used by people you may not know and may result in your receiving unsolicited emails. Users under the age of 18 should be particularly careful not to divulge any personal information. While KCET strives to protect and respect your privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose in a chat room or bulletin board and you do so at your own risk.

**Secure Credit Card Transactions**

KCET offers you the convenience of making on-line membership contributions and donations via credit card. KCET takes seriously the need for credit card account information security. On KCET's Website all financial transaction forms are stored and served from a secure server. This means that each page you view on KCET's Website and any financial information you submit is encrypted on its way between computers (yours and ours). Even in the highly unlikely event that your transmission is intercepted, the data will not be usable. Your peace of mind and the safeguarding of your credit card information are of the utmost importance to us. Your credit card information is used by KCET only for your intended purpose - that is, for the purchase or contribution you wish to make.
