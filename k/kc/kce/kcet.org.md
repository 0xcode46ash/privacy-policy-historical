# KCET Internet Legal Notice

KCET recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information collected from its members, donors, viewers of KCET and about visitors to KCET's Website. Here we explain how KCET collects information on-line and by other methods, what we do with that information, and what controls you have. We're committed to ensuring the privacy of your personally identifiable information (such as full name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and/or other identifiable information), protecting the security of making financial transactions and preserving the integrity of the medium.

  _Gathering and Use of Information_

1.  We will not collect personally identifiable information from you, other than what you supply to us on a voluntary basis. We may collect certain non-personal information to optimize our Web pages for your computer (i.e., the identity of your Internet browser, the type of operating system you use, your IP address and the domain name of your Internet service provider). We may use such non-personal information for internal purposes, including but not limited to improving the content of our website.

2.  In order to participate in some activities, you might be asked to provide some personally identifiable information. This could be in connection with the following:

  * contest or sweepstakes registration

  * subscription registration for websites

  * services which require subscription (such as e-mail or postal newsletters)

  * KCET membership submission

  * pledging financial support

  * content submissions, community postings (i.e., forums or bulletin boards), comments and suggestions or voting




You should recognize that if you choose not to voluntarily submit requested information, you may not be eligible for those activities for which personally identifiable information is needed.

 3.  In the event KCET wants to collect information for purposes other than those set forth in this policy, KCET will notify you when we are collecting personally identifiable information about you and how we intend to use it.

 4.  Personally identifiable information that members, donors, viewers and visitors provide to KCET or submit to our sites is used only for the purpose for which it is submitted unless we disclose other uses in this Privacy Policy or at the time of collection.  Such other uses may include sending our constituents information about KCET programs, services, or membership, sending you information or materials we think you will find interesting, or sharing the information with select third party companies or organizations.

5.  KCET's Website is a general audience website and does not knowingly market to, accept postings from or collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 18 years old.  However, KCET believes that it is important to assist parents in supervising their children's on-line activities and, therefore, recommends that parents consider using parental control tools available from on-line services and software manufacturers that help provide a child-friendly environment.  These tools can also prevent children from disclosing their name, address and other personally identifiable information on-line without parental permission.  For additional information about parental control tools, please consult the _Direct Marketing Association_ home page located at [**www.the-dma.org**](http://www.the-dma.org/). 

6\. KCET maintains a membership/customer database with the e-mail address, name and postal address, telephone number and other personally identifiable information of persons who have provided such information to KCET by mail, telephone or e-mailing us with questions about membership, submitting an on-line membership contribution (making an on-line pledge) or sending us an e-mail about our programs or services.  By supplying KCET with an e-mail address, telephone number or postal address you may receive future communications from KCET via e-mail, telephone or mail.  KCET, like many non-profits, occasionally shares its postal address lists with carefully selected companies and organizations not affiliated with KCET. KCET never shares the e-mail addresses or telephone numbers it collects with non-affiliated companies or organizations.  When you become a KCET member via mail, by telephone, on-line or make an on-line contribution, your name and address will be included in this list.  For more information regarding  KCET's policies on the handling and use of KCET's membership/customer lists please review **_[KCET's](https://web.archive.org/web/20021204102026id_/http%3A//www.kcet.org/listmanagement.htm)_[ Membership List Management Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20021204102026id_/http%3A//www.kcet.org/listmanagement.htm)**.

**__**If, at any time, you do not wish to have your name and postal address provided to these companies or organizations, or you do not wish to receive any further information or contact from KCET, you may**_ ** __**_**e-mail KCET by**_ _ **filling out our["Opt-Out" Form](https://web.archive.org/web/20021204102026id_/http%3A//www.kcet.org/optout.htm)**_, **_write KCET at 4401 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, California, Attn.:   Member Services, or call KCET at (323) 953-KCET(5238) and request that your name and postal address be excluded from any list provided to non-affiliated companies or organizations or request that KCET not contact you or send further information.  _**_**

_Chat Rooms and Bulletin Boards_

Please remember that any information posted on bulletin boards and/or communicated in chat areas becomes public information. You should use caution when sharing information, as any of it can be collected and used by people you may not know and may result in your receiving unsolicited e-mails. Users under the age of 18 should be particularly careful not to divulge any personal information. While KCET strives to protect and respect your privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose in a chat room or bulletin board and you do so at your own risk.

_Use of Cookies_

Cookies are data that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes.  Cookies are an industry standard used by most websites.  In general, cookies are used to customize user experience, count how many people visit a site, and track which pages on a site receives visits.  KCET uses cookies to help us determine how visitors use our website so we can improve your on-line experience. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information and are used only by KCET, in order to provide better statistics on traffic throughout our website. Cookies allow us to track usage patterns and to compile data that can help us improve our content and target marketing. If you do not want information collected through the use of Cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the Cookie feature.

_Secure Credit Card Transactions_

KCET offers you the convenience of making on-line membership contributions and donations via credit card. KCET takes seriously the need for credit card account information security.  On KCET's Website all financial transaction forms are stored and served from a secure server. This means that each page you view on KCET's Website and any financial information you submit is encrypted on its way between computers (yours and ours).  Even in the highly unlikely event that your transmission is intercepted, the data will not be usable. Your peace of mind and the safeguarding of your credit card information are of the utmost importance to us.  Your credit card information is used by KCET only for your intended purpose - that is, for the purchase or contribution you wish to make.

By using KCET's Website, you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of this KCET Privacy Policy and to the terms and conditions of KCET's Internet _[**Legal Notice**](https://web.archive.org/web/20021204102026id_/http%3A//www.kcet.org/legalnotice.htm)_. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, please do not use this site. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the KCET Website following the posting of any changes to these terms shall mean that you have accepted those changes. If you have any questions or concerns, please e-mail us at **_[optout](mailto:optout@kcet.org)_[@kcet.org](mailto:optout@kcet.org)** .
