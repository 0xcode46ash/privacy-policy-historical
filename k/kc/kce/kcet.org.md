# Privacy Policy | KCET

Community Television of Southern California ("KCETLink") respects the privacy rights of its members, donors, viewers and visitors to KCETLink's websites located at www.kcet.org/.com/.net/; aplaceofourown.org/.net/.tv; placeofourown.org/.net/.tv; and losninosensucasa.org/.com/.net/.tv (the "KCETLink Site(s)" or the "Site"). We have prepared this "Privacy Policy" so that you will know how and when we collect information that can specifically identify you ("Personal Information"), and how we use this information. A separate Kids Privacy Policy governs the parts of the KCETLink Sites that are directed at children under 13 years of age, including all web pages with an address that begins with http://www.kcet.org/kids. By participating in the KCETLink activities described below and using the KCETLink Sites, you acknowledge that you have accepted the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy, the Kids Privacy Policy, the Terms of Use, and, should you participate in an Online Forum (described below) the rules set forth in Online Forums.

**I. What is Personal Information?**   
Personal Information includes basic contact information about you such as your name, e-mail address, address, telephone number. How we collect and use Personal Information is detailed in this Privacy Policy. 

**II. How does KCET** **Link** **  Collect and Exchange Personal Information?**

_Subscription Activities and/or Promotional Events_  
KCETLink collects Personal Information through its membership subscriptions, pledges of financial support, and/or services which require subscriptions such as an email or postal newsletter ("Subscription Activities"). We may also request information from you about your child (such as first name, last name, date of birth and mailing address) if you choose to participate in KCETLink Kids' Club. Your Personal Information may be collected and used by KCETLink as is reasonably necessary to complete a transaction you requested (e.g., credit card information to process your purchase request). KCETLink also collects Personal Information directly from you, KCETLink affiliates, and others authorized by you to share your Personal Information with KCETLink. KCETLink may offer various correspondence in connection with its Subscription Activities (e.g., newsletters, postings or other communications) in order to inform its members, donors, viewers and KCETLink Site visitors about promotions, special offers, events, changes or postings to the KCETLink Sites. On occasion, we may hold certain contests, sweepstakes or other promotional events ("Promotional Events") and, in connection with those events, we may request that participants provide Personal Information. This information may be used to administer the Promotional Events, and notify and announce winners to the public. We may also exchange with, or rent to/from, a range of other organizations the names and addresses of individuals (but not telephone numbers or email addresses), as well as share Personal Information with a third party that might offer, sponsor or co-brand a Promotional Event or website ("Sponsoring Third Party(ies)"). For further discussion on Sponsoring Third Parties, please see Section IV. "May My Personal Information be Disclosed to Others?"

_Personal Information Collected on the KCETLink_ _  Sites_

**Automatic Collection of Information:** Like all web servers, the web server(s) of KCETLink Sites automatically create log files for each visitor who accesses the KCETLink Sites. These "access logs" allow us to make our site more useful to our visitors. The access logs do NOT record a visitor's name, address, phone number, credit card numbers, or any other Personal Information. Rather, they contain some or all of the following non-Personal Information: (a) the Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) of the machine which accessed the KCETLink Sites; (b) the date of the visit; (c) the time of the visit; (d) the path taken through our KCETLink Sites; (e) the browser being used; (f) a list of files downloaded or viewed; (g) the amount of time spent listening to RealAudio or Windows Media files; and (h) any errors encountered. 

The KCETLink Sites also use "cookies." Cookies are bits of electronic information that a website can transfer to a visitor's hard drive to help keep records of the visitor's use of the site. Cookies allow website operators such as KCETLink to help customize the site to the visitor's individual preferences. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet, and many major websites use them. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, generally you can change your browser either to prevent this or to notify you whenever you are sent a cookie. KCETLink does NOT associate information collected through its cookies with individual users, but may use such information to create aggregate and anonymous data. If you choose to not accept the KCETLink cookies, some portions of the KCETLink Sites may not function properly when you try to view them. 

**Online Forums:** In order to use certain portions of the KCETLink Sites, we may ask that you become a registered KCETLink Site user by providing certain Personal Information such as your age, email address, full name and zip code, as well as creating a user name and password. For example, KCETLink offers online forums such as blogs, bulletin boards, chat forums, and message boards ("Online Forums"), which may require participant registration. If you choose not to register for such Online Forums and decline to provide certain Personal Information, you may not be able to access and/or participate in KCETLink Online Forums. 

The nature of Online Forums such as blogging, chat forums and message boards is to share information and ideas with a public audience. Any information you submit for posting on an Online Forum may be posted on a KCETLink Site(s) or otherwise be made available to the general public. You are advised to use caution when participating in any Online Forum, as any information you post on the Online Forum can be collected and used by third parties and may result in your receiving unsolicited communications from third parties. 

**Minors and Online Forums:** Users under the age of 18 should be particularly careful not to divulge any Personal Information when using Online Forums. Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use the Online Forums. For further discussion, please see our Kids Privacy Policy and Section VI. "Can Minors Use KCETLink Sites?"

**Visitors of the KCET** **Link** **  Sites:** To enable us to better know and support "visitors" to the KCETLink Sites (which includes registered and non-registered KCETLink Site users), we may ask our visitors to voluntarily provide additional information, including Personal Information, such as your name, email address and demographic information, and these requests will be marked "optional" (or the equivalent). For example, by learning about your needs and interests, we may be able to better tailor specific KCETLink Site features, promotions, contests and other notifications for our members, donors, viewers and KCETLink Site users.

**III. How Does KCET** **Link** **  Use Personal Information?**

_General Uses_  
KCETLink may use your Personal Information and/or other information about or provided by you in the following ways: (1) to respond to your requests for information; (2) to process your purchase requests; (3) to provide you with communications, newsletters, emails and other information as authorized by you, as requested by you, or as part of your membership or participation in a subscription based service provided by KCETLink; (4) for contest management; (5) for editorial purposes such as contacting users for an online survey; (6) to send marketing and promotional communications from KCETLink or KCETLink member stations to users who have "opted-in" to be in receipt of such communication; (7) for informational notices about KCETLink or KCETLink member stations; (8) for purposes included in this Privacy Policy; (9) for any other use specified at the time the Personal Information is collected; and (10) for purposes that are new or outside the scope of this Privacy Policy but only after obtaining your prior consent. KCETLink may also use portions of Personal Information in a manner that is unlikely to directly reveal your identity. For example, if KCETLink wants to publicly use a quote from an email or online comment from you, we may give attribution to the quote by using your initials or first name with the city and state in which you reside. 

If you would like to "opt-out" of KCETLink's use of your Personal Information for purposes such as Subscription Activities, Promotional Events and the Online Forums, please follow the directions in Section VII. "How Do I Update My Personal Information and Privacy Preferences?" However, by "opting-out", you may adversely impact your ability to participate in and use the foregoing services, as well as prevent KCETLink from responding or processing your request for information, products or services. 

_Creation and Use of Aggregate Information_  
We may use your Personal Information and other information about or provided by you to create "Aggregated Information". Aggregated Information is created by aggregating or generating statistical data from Personal Information about groups of members, donors, viewers and KCETLink Site users. Aggregated Information also is anonymous data, because it cannot be used to identify a particular individual. We may use Aggregate Information for marketing, share it with our sponsors, business associates, or other affiliated companies, to better understand visitors to the KCETLink Sites and our members, and to improve KCETLink services such as the KCETLink Sites. 

**IV. May My Personal Information Be Disclosed to Others?**  
_Personal Information Which May Become Public_  
As discussed in Section II above, "Online Forums" and "Minors and Online Forums", any information that you disclose when participating in the Online Forums may become public, as well as any information disclosed in your participation in Promotional Events. In addition, if you send an e-mail, story idea, essay and/or other submission ("Submission") to KCETLink through any KCETLink Site, KCETLink may re-print that Submission (or an excerpt) online, or read it on air or otherwise publish it in any other medium, together with your name and city, state (if you provide that information). If a chosen Submission is from your posting to an Online Forum, your screen name (not your full name) and location also may be included. 

_Disclosure of Personal Information_  
KCETLink takes reasonable steps to restrict access to the Personal Information that we collect from members, donors, viewers and website visitors, but KCETLink may provide access as follows: (i) to those who may use the Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy, the [Terms of Use](http://www.kcet.org/about/terms-of-use.html), Online Forums, any other applicable agreement between you and KCETLink, or with your prior consent; (ii) to provide you with customer service; (iii) to protect the rights, property and safety of KCETLink, its subsidiaries, affiliate, business associates or partners, members, donors, viewers and website visitors or others; (iv) to parties engaged by KCETLink to process information to fulfill purposes authorized by you (e.g., processing of your credit card payment for a product; shipping to you an ordered product); or (v) relevant parties in the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, joint venture or other business transaction involving KCETLink. Additionally, KCETLink may exchange with, or rent to/from, a range of organizations the names and mailing addresses of individuals (but not email addresses or telephone numbers) provided that the organizations agreed in writing to use KCETLink provided Personal Information for the sole purpose of mailing individuals information about the organization's products/services and fundraising solicitations; you may instruct KCETLink not to share your Personal Information with such organizations by following the directions listed below under Section VII. "How Do I Update My Personal Information and Privacy Preferences?"

Further, KCETLink may also disclose Personal Information if required or authorized to do so by law, or if KCETLink believes that such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or with a legal process such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant or a law enforcement request, (b) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the KCETLink Site or other KCETLink content, or (c) protect the personal safety or property of KCETLink and KCETLink subsidiaries, affiliates, business associates or partners, members, donors, viewers and website visitors, the public or KCETLink and its employees. 

_Promotional Events Offered by Sponsoring Third Parties_  
If a Promotional Event or a website is offered by or with a Sponsoring Third Party(ies), your participation in such events or use of the website is your authorization to KCETLink to exchange your Personal Information with the Sponsoring Third Party(ies). If you do not want your Personal Information to be shared under these circumstances you may choose to not participate. Further, if you would like to "opt-out" of KCETLink exchanging your Personal Information with a Sponsoring Third Party(ies) as set forth in this paragraph, or if a third party shared your Personal Information with KCETLink without your authorization, please follow the directions listed below under Section VII. "How Do I Update My Personal Information and Privacy Preferences?"

You acknowledge that KCETLink has no control over, and is not responsible for the use and collection of Personal Information by any third party, including Sponsoring Third Parties, and that they may use it for direct marketing purposes. We therefore recommend that you review the privacy policies of these third parties before participating in an event, or using a website, that is controlled, sponsored, or co-branded with a third party so that you may be informed as to how those parties will use and share your Personal Information.

_Links to Third Party Websites_  
The KCETLink Sites may contain links, which, if you choose to click, will lead you to websites controlled by third parties. KCETLink is not responsible or liable for the actions of these third parties, including how they process personal information or for the content posted on their websites. If you decide to use a link on the KCETLink Sites to visit another website, we encourage you to review the posted privacy policy to learn how any personal information you provide to that site is processed. Your use of a third party website is at your own risk. However, as KCETLink strives to maintain the integrity and quality of the KCETLink Sites, you are invited to send your feedback regarding the sites connected through a link on the KCETLink Sites (including if a link does not work) by sending an email to viewerservices@kcet.org.

**V. Is My Personal Information Secure?**  
KCETLink offers you the convenience of making on-line membership contributions and donations via credit card. KCETLink uses reasonable precautions to keep this and other Personal Information disclosed to us secure. To reduce the risk of unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and help ensure correct usage of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Nonetheless, KCETLink does not guarantee the security, accuracy or completeness of any such procedures. You should be aware that third parties might unlawfully intercept transmissions of Personal Information or misuse or abuse the Personal Information that we collect from you. 

**VI. Can Minors Use the KCET** **Link** **  Sites? **

KCETLink highly recommends that parents and guardians spend time with their children when they are online or listening to or watching KCETLink content.
