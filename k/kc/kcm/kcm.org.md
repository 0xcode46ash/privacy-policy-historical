Online Privacy

The following online privacy principles apply when you visit our Web site at www.kcm.org: 

You can visit us on the Internet without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself, including your email address. Our web servers collect the domain name you used to access the Internet, such as aol.com or NBCi.com, and the Web site you came from and visit next. 

KCM uses this information to measure the number of visits, average time spent, pages viewed, and other statistics about visitors coming to our Web site in general. We may also use this data to monitor site performance and to make the site easier and more convenient to use. 

  * Cookies: We, along with thousands of other Web site hosts, use cookies to enhance your Web viewing experience and measure your Web site usage. (Cookies are small pieces of data stored by your Internet browser on your computer’s hard drive.)



The kcm.org Web site includes links to sites operated by other organizations. When you click through to another site, the privacy and protection policies of that site will apply and not those of kcm.org.

  * SSL Encryption: We use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to protect the transmission of information when submitting online contributions or product orders through our shopping cart.
  * E-mail: If you send us e-mail, you should know that there is no encryption to protect the transmission of that information and that it is not secured against interception.
