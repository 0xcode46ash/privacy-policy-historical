## Privacy Policy

#### Personal Information

We do not collect any personal information from a visitor to our sites unless that visitor explicitly and intentionally provides it. Under no circumstances do we collect any personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health, or sex life. If you are simply browsing our sites, we do not gather any personal information about you. 

#### Subscriptions

If you choose to subscribe to our premium products or services, we will request certain information from you such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and credit card information. 

#### Statistical Information about your Visit

When you visit our sites, our computers may automatically collect statistics about your visit. This information does not identify you personally, but rather about your visit to our sites. We may monitor statistics such as how many people visit our sites, the user's IP address, which pages people visit on our sites, from which domains our visitors reach our sites, and which browsers people use. We use these statistics about your visit for aggregation purposes only. These statistics are used to help us improve the performance of our Web sites. 

#### Our Commitment to Children's Privacy

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. 

#### Use of Cookies

A "cookie" is a piece of information that our web sites send to your browser, which then is stored on your system. A user can use our web sites without cookies; however, our systems need cookies for premium content in order to identify you as a premium subscriber. You may disable or delete the cookies at any time. Many users prefer to use cookies in order to help them navigate a Web site as seamlessly as possible. You should be aware that cookies contain no more information than you volunteer, and they are not able to "invade" your hard drive and return to the sender any personal or other information from your computer.

#### Disclosure by Law and Protection of eProduct

If we are required by law to disclose certain information to local, state, federal, national or international law enforcement authorities, we will do so. We will also disclose information to third parties as necessary in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, Farlex may share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud, or enforce or apply our agreements. 

#### Our Security Procedures

We consider the protection of all personally identifiable information we receive from our Web site visitors and subscribers as critical to our corporate mission. Please be assured that we have security measures in place to protect against the loss and misuse of any information we receive from you. As with any transmission over the Internet, however, there is always some element of risk involved in sending personal information. In order to try to minimize this risk, we encrypt all information that you submit in ordering of our premium products using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. We also have partnered with Authorize.net, one of the most reputable and experienced credit card payment companies in the World to handle our users' online transactions. 

Facilitating the Support, Renewal, and Purchase of our Products and Services. We may use the information you submit to contact you to discuss the support, renewal, and purchase of our premium products and services. You may receive a communication directly from one of our customer care representatives. Please be assured that we will keep the communications to a minimum and you will have an option to block any communication from us if your subscriptions are cancelled. 

Please be aware that we reserve the right to notify our subscribers of any information that affects the status of current subscriptions. You may not opt out of receiving information regarding the expiration and renewal of the subscriptions, account balances or the payment history and status. 

#### Changes to this Privacy Statement

If a material change is made to this Privacy Statement and/or the way we use our customers' personally identifiable information, a prominent notice of the nature of the change will be posted on this Privacy Statement and the current subscribers will be notified as soon as possible.
