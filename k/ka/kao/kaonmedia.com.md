# KAONMEDIA

Kaonmedia (hereinafter “We”, “Our”, “Us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the information that we gather through our website, how we use the information and the steps we take to protect your information. This Privacy Policy applies to this Kaonmedia website (www.kaonmedia.co.kr).

This Privacy Policy describes the types of personal information we collect; how we use that information.

This Privacy Policy does not govern websites of other parties to which we may provide links. We are not responsible, nor can we control the privacy practices or consent of those other sites.

INFORMATION COLLECTION

We collect personal information when you request us information from sales, employment, investor relations or general inquiries. We process your personal data, if you have contacted us via our contact forms or if you are just a visitor to our website.

Contact form:  
If you contact us via our contact forms, we will collect your name and email address. 

Applying for a job:  
If you apply for a job via our application form, we collect your name, email address, phone number, gender and your residence. We will also collect information about your CV, personal letter and any other document you might send us.

Cookies:  
Cookies are small bits of data we store on the device (computer, mobile phone, tablet or any other mobile device) that you use to access our website, so we can recognize repeat visitors. We use cookies for several reasons. For example: 

• Enabling a service to recognize your device so you don’t have to give the same information several times during one task.  
• Recognizing that you may already have given typed in your email address so you don’t have to do it for every webpage requested. 

If you'd like to remove or disable cookies via your browser, you certainly can. Refer to your browser's configuration documentation to do this since the steps for doing so are usually browser-specific. If you do go this route, this might adversely impact your ability to use our services effectively. Enabling cookies ensures a smoother experience when you use our site

SECURITY AND YOUR RIGHTS

When you submit your personal information via our website, your information is protected.

Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example sending emails) are granted access to personally identifiable information.

You have the rights to edit, correct, erase or access to the information we have on you. Please contact privacy@kaonmedia.com if you wish to do so.
