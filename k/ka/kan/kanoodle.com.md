# Kanoodle.com - Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy**

In this Information Age, you need to know how information about you is gathered and used on the Internet. At Kanoodle.com, we take your privacy seriously and do all we can to protect it. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use information about you as you utilize Kanoodle.com. Our Privacy Policy is subject to change, so we encourage you to visit this page occasionally for more information.

**Why We Collect Personal Information**  
First and foremost, Kanoodle.com collects personal information to personalize your experience with our site. The more we know about you, the more we can present you with information and features that will interest you. The facts you provide, along with data stored in your personal "cookie," (see below) may also be used to make online shopping faster and more convenient by helping us understand your shopping needs and patterns.

We also use user information to measure our success and performance. For example, aggregate information gives us an idea of the number of visitors we attract and how they navigate they site. By collecting information, we can also figure the number of entries in Kanoodle.com promotions and contents. The information we collect enables us to contact users with offers and advertisements that may appeal to them. At times, we may also use the information we collect to notify users of site updates and to promote special events at Kanoodle.com.

**How We Gather Data on Kanoodle.com Users**  
We gather information in a number of ways, depending on the section you are using within Kanoodle.com.

Sometimes, we simply ask you to provide your name, e-mail address, zip code, and country. Whenever you give this kind of information, it helps us to tailor our content for you.

At other times – such as when you buy compact discs, enter Kanoodle.com promotions or contents, or answer surveys on our site – we may ask for more detailed personal information. For instance, when you make a purchase through Kanoodle.com, we collect your billing and shipping address, telephone number, credit card information, and other information necessary to complete the transaction.

Wherever we ask you for personal information, we try to include a link to this Privacy Policy for your review.

**Other Companies’ Access to Your Personal Information**  
Kanoodle.com does not sell, rent or trade user information to other companies. Our site may link to advertisers and sites that collect personally identifiable information about you when you access them from Kanoodle.com. This type of collection or use of personal information is beyond Kanoodle.com’s control and is not covered by this Privacy Policy.

We may occasionally need to share your information with business partners who co-sponsor contests or other services. In these cases, we will provide only the data that is needed to make the service or contest successful. If we plan to share this type of information, we will notify you before we collect it. If you do not want Kanoodle.com to share your information, simply choose not to allow the transfer by not using or signing up for the contest or service in question.

When you purchase an item through our online store or sign up to receive promotional items from us, we may need to share some personal information with the third parties helping us to complete your transaction or send you the items you have requested. When we share your information with such third parties, we will disclose only the information needed to complete your transaction.

"Cookies" are small data files that are sent from the site to your browser and are stored on your hard drive, keeping track of your general activity on the site. When you make subsequent visits to the site, your cookie gives us a summary of your preferences and past experiences on the site. This allows us to tailor Kanoodle.com to your needs.
