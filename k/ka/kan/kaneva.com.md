# - Kaneva - Now Playing!

**Kaneva, Inc. is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of consumers of its interactive products and services. Throughout cyberspace, we want to contribute to providing a safe and secure environment for consumers.**

The purpose of this Kaneva, Inc. privacy policy is to inform you, as a welcome visitor to Kaneva, what kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit Kaneva, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the information. This privacy policy applies to the Kaneva site and other Internet-accessible Kaneva-branded services that incorporate this policy (although we will refer here only to Kaneva, Inc. to make reading this policy easier). Finally, please note that this policy applies only to Kaneva, and not to other companies' or organizations' Web sites to which we link.

**Information About All Kaneva Visitors**

  
In general, our site automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to Kaneva and its areas, very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use such data in the aggregate. This aggregate data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of the site, so we can improve our site to assure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible. For example, Kaneva uses a technology nicknamed "cookies" that tells us how and when pages in our site are visited, and by how many people. These cookies do not collect personally identifiable information and we do not combine information collected through these cookies with other personally identifiable information to tell us who you are or even what your screen name or e-mail address is. We also may provide statistical "ratings" information, never information about you personally, to our Kaneva partners about how our members, collectively, use Kaneva. We do this so they too can understand how much people use their areas and our site in order for them to provide you with the best possible Web experience as well. Finally, Kaneva, its advertisers and ad servers may also use cookies, as well as small pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear gifs," to determine on an anonymous basis which advertisements and promotions users have seen and how users responded to them, but do not use these technologies to collect personally identifiable information unless you give us permission to do so. 

**Information About You**

If you are a Kaneva Member or Subscriber, when you access Kaneva you may obtain access to features of the Kaneva service that contain personal information, such as e-mail. Additionally, we may specifically ask for information about you when you sign up to use a service, like Kaneva, or when you order a product. We will need certain information -- such as name, Internet address, billing address, type of computer, credit card number -- in order to provide that service or product to you. We may also use that information to let you know of additional products and services about which you might be interested. You can choose not to receive such information if you don't want to by letting us know on the registration screen when you sign up for the product or service. We may ask you for information about your interests so that both you and we can take advantage of the interactivity of the online medium, but you may always choose to respond or not. Additionally, we may provide you with an opportunity to be listed in a directory on one of our Kaneva-branded services -- these listings are also optional and you can make changes to or eliminate this information when you want to. We also use cookie technology in order to improve your experience, including to remember your preferences or customized settings when you use Kaneva and its related services, and to authenticate your access to your personal information. 

**Disclosure**

  
We do not use or disclose information about your individual visits to Kaneva or information that you may give us on Kaneva, such as your name, address, email address or telephone number, to any outside companies without your prior consent. Kaneva may share such information in response to legal process, such as a court order or subpoena, or in special cases such as a physical threat to you or others. And, as we mention above, we may share with our Web site partners aggregated statistical "ratings" information about the use of Kaneva. We do retain the right to provide all information collected, including your personal information, to any successor company in the event of a merger, acquisition or sale of Kaneva, Inc., its business, or any of its related companies or businesses. 

**Your Role in Protecting Your Privacy**

Never share your Kaneva passwords with anyone whom you don't want accessing your account. You must contact us immediately if you feel that your password has been compromised in any way, or otherwise needs to be changed or deactivated. 

**Signing Out**

If you are using a public terminal, you will want to make sure you log off, or sign out, before you leave the terminal. To do this, close your web-browser's window. This will close your session to our website and log you out of our system. If you are logged in for an extended period of time without using the site or its services, you will be automatically logged out and must sign back in to continue your session. 

**Linking web sites**

The web site contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any other site, including any sites that may indicate a special relationship or partnership with us (such as co-branded pages or "powered by" or "in cooperation with" relationships). We do not share information with other websites or any other entities or individuals unless such sharing is approved in advance by you. 

**Changes to the Privacy Statement**

We may change this privacy statement at any time by posting revisions. Your use of the site constitutes acceptance of the provisions of this privacy statement and your continued usage after such changes are posted constitutes acceptance of each revised policy statement. Please check this privacy statement periodically for changes. If you do not agree to the terms of this privacy statement or any revised privacy statement, please exit the web site immediately.
