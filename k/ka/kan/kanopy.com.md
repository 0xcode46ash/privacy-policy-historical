# Privacy Policy | Kanopy

_Last Updated: 10 August 2015_

At Kanopy, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We know that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will use information you provide us carefully and sensibly to solely fulfill our service commitments to you and optimize your experience with our solution.

What Information Do We Collect?

Users of Kanopy may provide information to us at different points. You may request a trial or inquire with us through our website; you may order a product from us and provide purchasing information (such as credit card details) during the process; you may set up a "user profile" on Kanopy to be able to access the enhanced user features and tools for which this is necessary (e.g. the clip/playlist creation tool, "add to watchlist" feature, and other user tools).

The information we learn from you helps us to personalize and continually improve your experience with our solution. The types of information that we can have regarding you include:

Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. When you place an order, request a trial, set up a user profile or take other actions on our Web site, you may be asked to provide certain information (e.g. email address, name, mail address, etc). Some of our user profile features provide us other information about you (e.g. if you add films to your watch list or if you create a clip of a film for later reference). You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of number of our features on the Web site. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, providing you the ability to use tools and features on the Web site that necessitate this information, customizing the user experience for you, and communicating with you.

In addition, you may from time to time provide other information to Kanopy. For example, you may voluntarily sign up to be informed about certain promotional offers, newsletters, or our blog service. For this service we need only your name and e-mail address, which we only use to send the information you requested. When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address and e-mail address, so we can administer the contest and notify winners as per the contest processes.

Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of our tools and enhance your experience with us, we recommend that you leave them turned on.
