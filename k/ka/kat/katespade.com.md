## what information about me is collected and stored?

_personally identifiable information:_ personally identifiable information ("pii") is information that identifies you or could reasonably be used to identify you personally (such as your real name, address, phone number or email address). for example, when you create an account with us, your account information is stored on this website's server. we may also ask you to provide us with certain pii in connection with the use of this website, in connection with the services provided by our customer service department, in connection with a brick and mortar transaction (except where prohibited by law) or in connection with an off-line promotion or sweepstakes. for example, we may ask you to provide certain pii when you register with us, place an order on the website, choose to sign up for an email newsletter, or participate in a promotional event. this information is used to provide the products and services that you have ordered or requested, to process and ship orders, to send order and shipping confirmations and to provide customer service. this information also may be used to contact you about sales, special offers and new website features, unless you have opted not to receive promotional communications in connection with this website. we may also ask you to provide us with demographic information, information regarding your interests or similar information. providing us with information about yourself is voluntary, and you can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in some of the website's features.

in addition, you may have the opportunity to provide us with the pii, such as name or e-mail address of a friend, such as when you choose the email addresses you supply us for those activities will not be retained for other purposes unless otherwise disclosed at the time you provide such information. we encourage you to send such items only to recipients who are your friends or family or persons with whom you have a relationship so that it doesn't seem like we are "spamming" them.

non-personally identifiable information: when your computer contacts our web servers (for example, when you visit this website, or view an html e-mail), our web servers automatically collect website usage information. website usage information is non-identifying information that describes how our visitors use and navigate our website. it can include the number and frequency of visitors to each webpage and the length of their stays, browser type, referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting our website, and ip addresses (see below for more information on ip addresses). we also may determine the applicable technology available in order to serve you the most appropriate version of a web page, e-mail or similar service. this information is used to analyze and improve this website and to provide our customers with a fulfilling shopping experience.

_use of cookies:_ also, like many websites, we use "cookies". cookies are pieces of information that a website either transfers to your computer's hard drive or stores temporarily in your computer's memory for record-keeping purposes. we may use cookies for a number of purposes. for example, cookies help us to identify account holders and to optimize their shopping experience. cookies also allow us to hold selections in a shopping cart when a user leaves this website without checking out. when you log in at this web site with your username and password, we will assign you a secure session id. the server then passes your information to you through this secure session id. also, we wil l use cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of this website. cookies are also used to track the identity of the website you visited immediately prior to visiting this website; otherwise, we do not track information about your use of other websites. most browsers accept cookies automatically. you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. however, we recommend that you leave cookies "turned on" so that we can offer you a better shopping experience on this website. if you decline to accept cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in certain features of this website.

_use of web beacons:_ our web pages or e-mail messages may contain a small graphic image called a web beacon, which is sometimes also called a "clear gif", that allows us to monitor and collect certain limited information about our users, such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the ip address of the computer that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed. web beacons can be very small or invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or e-mail, including html based content, can act as a web beacon. we may use web beacons to count visitors to our web pages or to monitor how our users navigate our website, and we may include web beacons in e-mail messages in order to count how many messages we sent were actually opened or acted upon. we use web beacons to compile aggregate statistics about our website and our marketing campaigns.

_use of ip addresses:_ an ip address is a number that is assigned to your computer or network when you are linked to the internet. when you request pages from this website, our servers log your ip address. we may use ip address for a number of purposes, such as system administration, to report aggregate information to our business partners or to audit the use of the website. we may associate your ip address with the pii you provide.

we also may collect and store information about you that we receive from other sources, to enable us to update and correct the information contained in our database and to provide product recommendations and special offers that we think will interest you.

## is information collected from children?

we do not knowingly sell or ship any items ordered through this website directly to anyone who we know to be under the age of 13, nor do we collect any pii from anyone who we know to be under the age of 13. if you are under the age of 18, you should use this website only with the involvement of a parent or guardian and should not submit any pii to us. if we discover that a person under the age of 13 has provided kate spade with pii, kate spade will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete such person's pii from its system.

## kate spade's use and disclosure of collected information

use by kate spade: we may use your pii to provide you with requested information, services or content, to contact you in connection with a promotion, or for other purposes disclosed when you provide the information. we may also contact you from time to time on behalf of one of our affiliated companies or an external business partner with information that may be of interest to you. we may also contact you regarding any problems or questions we have relating to your use of our website, or, in our discretion, notify you of changes to our privacy policy, terms of use or other policy or terms that affect you and your use of our website. we may also use information about our users, including pii, for internal purposes.

## with whom does kate spade share information?

we may provide information to select outside companies when we believe their products or services may be of interest to you. if you opt in to receive communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy and not this privacy policy. therefore, if you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly. in addition, kate spade may share your pii with third parties under the following circumstances:

_third parties providing services on our behalf:_ we may engage third parties to perform services in connection with the operation of our business. examples of these services include: (a) payment processing and authorization, (b) fraud protection and credit risk reduction, (c) product customization, (d) order fulfillment, (e) shipping, (f) marketing and promotional material distribution, (g) website evaluation, (h) data collection, storage, management, analysis and, where applicable, cleansing, and (i) any other services designed to assist us in maximizing our business potential. these third parties may have access to this website's user information, including pii, to the extent it is needed to perform their duties and functions.

_kate spade's security:_ we may release information about our users, including pii, when legally required to do so, at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation, or to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our website and applicable laws. we may also disclose such user information whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of kate spade, llc, or any of our respective affiliates, business partners, customers or others.

_aggregate information:_ we may disclose non-identifying, aggregated user statistics to third parties for a variety of purposes, including describing our services to prospective partners and other third parties. examples of such non-personal information include the number of users who visited this website during a specific time period or purchased a specific product through this website.

_promotions:_ if you choose to enter a contest, sweepstakes or promotion, your pii may be disclosed to third parties in connection with such promotion, including without limitation for purposes of posting your entry with attribution or otherwise as permitted in the official rules for the promotion in question, fulfilling your prize or including your name on a winners list. also, by entering a promotion, we may require you to consent to the use of your pii or other information, such as name, voice or likeness, in advertising, promotional and marketing materials. in addition, we may offer certain promotional content, such as a sweepstakes, sponsored by or co-branded with a third party, who may obtain the pii that you submit. __

_corporate change:_ in addition, we reserve the right to disclose, share and/or otherwise transfer user information, including without limitation pii, in connection with a corporate merger, acquisition, consolidation, the sale of a portion of our business or the sale of substantially all of kate spade's assets, or other fundamental corporate change, whatever form it may take. you will be notified via e-mail or prominent notice on our website prior to a change of ownership or control of your personal information, if your personal information will be used contrary to this policy. for clarification and the removal of doubt, kate spade specifically reserves the right to transfer or share a copy of personally identifiable information collected pursuant to this privacy policy from this web site, off-line or otherwise, to the buyer of that portion of its business relating to that information.

## what steps are taken to keep personal information secure?

we use various security measures, including secure socket layer (ssl) encryption technology, to protect personal information that we collect. if you place an order through this website, you will be asked to set up an account and provide an email address and password. you must provide an appropriate email address and password in order to access account information. in order to help protect your personal information further, you should be careful about providing your password to others. if you wish to cancel a password, or if you become aware of any loss, theft or unauthorized use of a password, please contact our customer service department by email at customerservice@katespade.com.

we strive to ensure the security of your pii on our systems, including limiting access to the pii contained on our servers. unfortunately, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. we cannot and do not ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to kate spade and you do so at your own risk.

## how can i access, correct and update personal information?

you can access, correct and update certain personal information that you have provided to us by clicking on "manage your account" within the help desk area of this website.

## your choices/unsubscribe

you will have an opportunity to unsubscribe from receiving promotional material from this website by clicking on an "unsubscribe" hyperlink contained in promotional emails we send you. additionally you may email us at customerservice@katespade.com or write to us at kate spade new york, attn: customer service, 2 park avenue, new york, ny 10016. because customer lists often are prepared well in advance of an offering (sometimes a few months before the offer is made), you may continue to receive some offers after you send us a request not to use your information for specified marketing purposes. please be aware that we will process your request as quickly as we reasonably can, but it may not be possible to update our systems immediately. we appreciate your patience and understanding in giving us time to carry out your request.

even if you are removed from any such list, if you order online, we will send you an email confirming your order and may need to contact you by phone, email, or regular mail if we have questions about your order. in addition, you should be aware that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons.

if you want to opt out of having your pii shared with third parties for marketing purposes, you must consistently opt-out at each of our websites where you register and whenever you provide pii to us. please bear in mind that this opt-out choice for "third parties" will not apply to kate spade, kate spade licensees and/or co-branding participants, as set forth below. please also keep in mind that any opt-out choices you make will not apply in situations where (a) you either have made, simultaneously make, or later make a specific request for information from us, or (b) kate spade uses your pii for either operational purposes (e.g. to complete transactions requested by you, or to send you administrative communications either about your account with us or about features of our websites, including any future changes to this privacy policy, the terms of use, or any other policy or terms that affect you and your use of our website) or fulfillment purposes (e.g. sharing with companies that facilitate communications and transactions with you).

finally, if you do not exercise your opt-out choices upon registration or otherwise at the time the pii is provided, it may take some time to process your opt-out choices. our systems require time to update, and promotional mailings using pii shared before your opt-out may already be in process. thus, your pii might continue to be shared with third parties for promotional purposes for some time after you make your request, for similar reasons, if your pii is shared with a third party, kate spade largely or completely loses control over how that information is used. thus, even after you have opted out of allowing us to share your pii, you might continue to receive promotional materials from third parties unless and until you duly register your opt-out request with each third party in question.
