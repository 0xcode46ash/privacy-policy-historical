# Kaleidescape’s Privacy Policy

          Kaleidescape’s Privacy Policy
Kaleidescape, Inc. and its affiliates (hereafter referred to collectively as “Kaleidescape”)
take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal
information that we collect and receive about you and your use of your Kaleidescape
System (“System”), our Movie Guide Service, and our Web site.
This Privacy Policy supplements and is incorporated into the Kaleidescape Service &
License Agreement. This Privacy Policy constitutes the entire agreement between you
and Kaleidescape concerning the subject matter herein, and your acceptance of the
Kaleidescape Service & License Agreement will signify your acceptance of this Privacy
Policy.
To provide you with a better, more satisfying experience, Kaleidescape collects and uses
certain types of information, as described below. Kaleidescape does not intend to disclose
to any third party, except as provided below, any personal information, in particular, what
movies you – as an individual or household – have purchased, or loaded into, or viewed
with your System.
Types of Information Collected
    •   Kaleidescape collects certain account information when you register, such as your
        name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address. Kaleidescape collects
        additional account information from time to time, such as serial numbers of the
        components of your System and the software versions and options used by them.
    •   Kaleidescape automatically collects and maintains a log of diagnostic information
        for every System for the purposes of quality control and technical
        troubleshooting. Diagnostic information includes a detailed record of the
        operating history of your System, such as configuration changes, DVD imports,
        user inputs (including details about movies played), disk failures, user interface
        response times, and remaining available disk space. Diagnostic information also
        contains, and is identified by, the serial numbers of the components of your
        System and their IP addresses.
    •   We automatically collect IP addresses and Web site usage information from you
        when you visit our Web site. This information helps us evaluate how our visitors
        use and navigate our Web site on an aggregate basis, including the number and
        frequency of visitors to each Web page, and the length of their visits.

How We Use Information Collected
We may use information in the following ways:
    •   For the purposes for which you specifically provided the information including,
        for example, to provide a service that you desire, to troubleshoot your System, or
        to send e-mails that you have requested.
    •   To send you e-mail notifications about new or existing products and services,
        such as software upgrades.
    •   To enhance existing features or develop new features, products, and services.
    •   To provide third parties with aggregate information (that will not identify you or
        your household) about our user base and usage patterns, including movies played.
    •   To allow us to personalize your experience using your System based on personal
        characteristics or preferences.
Except as specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your personally
identifiable information outside of Kaleidescape.
We may disclose and use personally identifiable information to resolve disputes,
troubleshoot problems, or to enforce our Kaleidescape Service & License Agreement (for
example, when necessary to protect our or a third party’s intellectual property or
proprietary rights). We may also disclose personally identifiable information when we, in
our sole discretion, believe it is necessary or appropriate, in connection with a sale or
transfer of some or all of our assets, or when we, in good faith, believe that the law
requires us to do so.
We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf including
packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about
products and services, processing registrations, and designing future products. We will
only provide those companies with the information they need to deliver the service, and
they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
Your information may be stored and processed in the United States and/or Canada; you
consent to any transfer of your personal information to or between these countries.
Security of your Personal Information
Kaleidescape is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We
use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal
information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, your personal
information will be stored on computer servers with limited access that are located in
controlled facilities. When we transmit sensitive information (such as a credit card
number) over the Internet, we protect it through encryption.
Policy Modifications
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any changes here, so
be sure to check back periodically.

Technical Problems
Even though Kaleidescape has taken steps to ensure that your personal information will
not be collected, used, or disclosed by Kaleidescape except as set forth by this Privacy
Policy, technical mistakes are possible. If such a mistake takes place, we will take
commercially reasonable steps to correct it.
