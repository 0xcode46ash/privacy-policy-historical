Capitalized terms in this policy shall have the meaning attributed to them in the Kaltura [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/tandc).

### What This Privacy Policy Covers

Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.

Kaltura may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. 
  * When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, ZIP code, website, and personal interests. When you register with Kaltura and sign in to the Kaltura Website, you are not anonymous to us.

### Information Sharing and Disclosure

  * Kaltura does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:   

    * We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Kaltura under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Kaltura communicate with you about offers from Kaltura and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
    * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
    * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Kaltura's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
    * We transfer information about you if Kaltura is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Kaltura will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
  * Kaltura displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria—for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.   

    * Kaltura does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.
    * Kaltura advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies)
  * Kaltura works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in different industries and categories of business. For more information regarding providers of products or services that you've requested please contact us at [info@kaltura.com](mailto:info@kaltura.com).
