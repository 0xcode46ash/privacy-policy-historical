**Cookies, Beacons and Similar Technologies:** Technologies such as cookies or similar tracking technologies are used by Us, Our partners (e.g. marketing partners), Our analytics providers or Our service providers (e.g. online customer support providers).

## 3\. How We Use the Information We Collect

We will not share your personal information with third parties, nor will We disclose your information outside of Kaseya without your consent except as described in this Privacy Statement. We will not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to third parties. We use the information We collect to provide and enhance Our products and services, to operate Our business (e.g. billing and other accounting purposes; establishing accounts and contacting you regarding important information about your account, including notices and updates), for editorial and feedback purposes, marketing and promotional purposes (including providing your contact information to third parties with whom Kaseya has a relationship), statistical analysis, product development, to contact you regarding our products and services, to monitor and maintain our network and to address issues that may arise concerning claims of abuse or inappropriate activity. For example, We may use the information We collect for the following purposes: displaying personalized content and advertising; information security and IT management; informing you of other products or services offered by Us; sending you relevant survey invitations; providing you with additional materials regarding Our products and services or to connect you with a Kaseya representative; responding directly to your questions, comments or requests for support; analyzing site usage to improve and customize Our web sites and products and service offerings; improving Our marketing and promotional efforts; compiling; and enforcing Our agreements with you. Some of the information We collect allows Us to differentiate users on Our network, and in some cases, We act as a pass-through for certain pieces of information to obtain authentication for Internet access. The information We collect may be combined with information obtained from other sources and other companies. We may compile, sell, and otherwise use for any purpose any Usage Data or other data as set forth in the Kaseya End User License Agreement and Terms of Service including information that We may receive by providing support or professional services under that agreement. We occasionally hire other companies to assist Us in providing products or services, handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, customer billing, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.

We may access and/or disclose any information if We believe such action is necessary to: (a) comply with any law, judicial proceeding, government request, court order, legal process, rule or regulation or any process served on Us; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Kaseya (including the enforcement of Our agreements and investigation of potential violations thereof); (c) protect your safety or the safety of others; (d) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or (e) act in urgent circumstances or emergencies. If We are acquired by or merged with a third party, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website, of any change in ownership, uses of your personal information, and choices you may have regarding your personal information. We reserve the right, to transfer the personal information We have collected as part of that transaction or proposed transaction, provided that such third party agrees to maintain procedures no less protective than those found in our Privacy Statement.

## 4\. Accessing And Changing Your Personal Information

You may request to view, change or delete your personal information by managing your account through the online portal or by emailing our customer support at [billing@kaseya.com](mailto:billing@kaseya.com). We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. To protect your privacy and security, we may require steps to verify your identity, such as a password and user ID, before granting access to your data.

## 5\. Third Party Sites and Services

Related offerings with links from Kaseya’s websites have their own privacy policies that can be viewed by clicking on the corresponding links within each respective website. All Kaseya partners are encouraged to participate in industry privacy initiatives and to take a responsible attitude towards consumer privacy. However, since we do not have direct control over the policies or practices of participating third parties, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those sites. We recommend and encourage that you always review the privacy policies of those third parties before you provide any personal information or complete any transaction with such parties.

## 6\. Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information

Kaseya does not knowingly collect or use personal information from children under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age in the respective jurisdiction. If Kaseya learns that we have personal information on a child under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, we will take steps to delete that information from our systems.

## 7\. Security

Kaseya takes information security seriously and uses reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access. When you place orders on our websites, all of your order information, including your credit card number and delivery address, is transmitted through the Internet using Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology. TLS technology causes your browser to encrypt your order information before transmitting it to our secure server. We use a variety of security technologies depending on the situation to help protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, such as physical access controls, TLS, Internet firewalls, and network monitoring. However, no security system is 100% secure, and therefore we cannot guarantee the security of your information or assume liability for improper access to it. If you use a password to help protect your information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential, change the password frequently and use a strong password. We strongly recommend that you do not share this password with anyone.

## 8\. Data Retention

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, contact us at [billing@kaseya.com](mailto:billing@kaseya.com). We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

## 9\. Communication Preferences

You can stop delivery of promotional e-mail or other Kaseya communications by contacting Kaseya at [_webmaster@kaseya.com_](mailto:webmaster@kaseya.com). Additionally, when you purchase products or services from Us, We may deliver non-promotional communications related to those products or services which may not be canceled unless you cease use of the product or service.

## 10\. Changes to this Statement

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this statement, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page prior to the change becoming effective. Your continued use of Kaseya’s products, services or websites or communication with Kaseya constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Statement and any updates.
