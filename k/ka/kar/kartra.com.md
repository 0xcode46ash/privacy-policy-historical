# Kartra | Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to Kartra website(s) provided by Genesis Digital, LLC and its affiliated companies, including the site at kartra.com and to any software, services, and/or products offered on such website (hereafter "KARTRA").

KARTRA values privacy – ours and yours. To help maintain your privacy and the security of your personal information, we communicate our privacy policy to KARTRA employees and internally enforce privacy safeguards.

We’ve developed this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store information received from you. Before disclosing information to us, please familiarize yourself with our privacy practices so you can understand how your information may be used by KARTRA.

### Our Collection and Use of Information:

KARTRA may collect information in a number of ways from users who access our website or services. You may provide your information to us to receive a product, service, or communication from us; we may request your information to better serve you; or we may require your information in order to complete a transaction (e.g. a purchase) or provide access (e.g. to a paid service).

  1. #### Collection of Personal Information

Personal information (or "Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII") is information and data that can be used to specifically identify or contact a single person.

You may be asked to provide your personal information when you contact KARTRA for any reason. KARTRA may share your personal information internally. If we do, we will use it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may also combine personal information with other information to help us to develop or improve our products, services, content, communications, and/or advertising, or to provide improved user experiences for you.

**Personal information we collect**

Examples of some types of personal information KARTRA may collect and how we may use it include the following:

    * When you purchase or register services or software products, request support, download a software update, register for a webinar, live workshop, or training, provide feedback on a software product, participate in a promotion, contest or online survey, or respond to an advertisement, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, and/or credit card information.

    * If you use the KARTRA shopping cart software, we may collect information required to provide the services in connection with such service including certain personally identifying financial information ("PIFI") such as your name, your credit card number (or a portion thereof), the expiration date for the credit card, bank information such as your bank’s name and routing number, and/or your account information. This information may only be stored temporarily, or transiently, e.g. during a particular secure session between your computer and a KARTRA server.

    * We may ask for certain information only in circumstances where required by law. For example, if in the US, we are required when setting up certain financial accounts to obtain your Social Security number (SSN), then we will ask for it. As above, such information may only be stored transiently, during a secure session.

**How we use your personal information**

    * Optional Communications: The personal information we collect allows us to provide you with KARTRA’s latest product announcements, helpful tips and information, special offers, software updates, and upcoming events. If you don’t want to receive these communications, or do not wish to be on our mailing list, you can opt out. Each communication will provide opt out directions, and you can also opt out via your account dashboard if you are a registered user, client, or customer. The information in connection with these optional communications and your responses to them help us to improve our products, services, content, and advertising.

    * We also use personal information to help us develop, deliver, improve, and customize our products, services, content, and advertising, and to provide a better user experience for every user of our products and services.

    * Important Communications: We may use your personal information to send important communications, e.g., about your purchases, material changes to our EULA, terms, conditions, and policies (including this Privacy Policy), critical updates to software, or regulatory changes that impact your use of KARTRA products or services. Because this information is vital to your interaction with KARTRA, you may NOT opt out of receiving these communications if you wish to continue to use our site(s), products, or services.

    * We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve KARTRA’s products, services, communications, support and/or help functions, and user interfaces.

    * If you enter into a promotion such as a contest, a giveaway, a one-time or special offer, or similar promotion, we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.

  2. #### Collection of Non-Personal Information

Information of a type or in a form that does not permit direct identification of, or association with any specific individual is non-personal information. Combinations of personal and non-personal information are considered personal information if the combined information can be used to identify or contact any specific individual(s). Aggregated data is considered non-personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy as long as it cannot be used to identify or contact any specific individual. Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and certain other identifiers may be considered personal information under various local laws; we endeavor to comply with the laws and regulations that are applicable to us.

**How we collect and use your non-personal information**

We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.

The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:

    * We may collect non-personal information (e.g. demographic information) regarding our customers collectively including information such as age, gender, occupation, preferred language, zip code, area code, geographic location, or the time zone from which customers access the KARTRA website(s), products, or services. Such non-personal information is used so that we can better understand who our customers are, and their behavior generally with regards to KARTRA, and to improve our products, services, communications, support, help, user experiences, and advertising for our customers.

    * We also may collect non-personal information regarding customer activities on our website or through the KARTRA products and services. This information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest. Non-personal support or help request data may be used to improve our software or sites, communications, and user interfaces, or to allow us to provide additional product or service offerings to our present or future customers.

    * We may collect non-personal information regarding the digital footprints of our customers with respect to accessing KARTRA sites, products, or services including mobile and non-mobile access, specific types of devices being used, unique device IDs, type of browser(s) being used, networks that our customers use, and other non-personal information. This information may be used to improve our sites, products, or services including but not limited to their performance, functionality, design, or responsiveness.

  3. #### Cookies and Other Technologies

To help KARTRA serve you better, we use technological means to better understand and adapt to user behavior. To accomplish this, KARTA’s website(s), online software or applications, email messages, and advertisements may use cookies or related technology such as pixel tags, clear gifs, and web beacons. These technologies help us to know which parts of our website people have visited, and provide data to aid us in understanding the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. These data are used to improve our products, services, communications, and advertisements. We consider information collected through the use of cookies and other technologies as non-personal information, and treat it accordingly.

We also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our site(s), software, products, or services. These uses are intended to improve your personal experience. We can provide better and more personal results if we ‘remember’ your preferred settings, your name, and such.

KARTRA may use cookies or other technologies in connection with certain advertising services to determine your experience with our content including whether an ad is likely to be of interest to you, whether or not you are served a particular ad, and the number of times you are served a particular ad. These technologies allow us to measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. You may have options for opting out of such targeted ads. You should contact your service provider or your mobile provider to inquire about how to do so.

KARTRA also uses specific technologies in connection with certain communications such as emails that may be used to track actions by recipients. For example, these communications may include one or more clickable text or graphic elements that include URLs that link to content on the KARTRA site. However, these URLs, may pass through a web server that tracks the click before arriving at the linked content on our website. The tracked data can help KARTRA determine the effectiveness of our communications to users and customers, or to gage interest in specific topics. If you prefer not to have your responses to such communications tracked in this manner, do not click links in the email messages. Such communications may also include pixel tags that can tell us whether, e.g., an email has been opened. We may use this information to throttle the number of messages sent to users or customers, or to remove people who do not read or interact with our communications from one or more lists.

Cookies and other technologies can generally be controlled on your devices. If you want to disable cookies, you should review your privacy or security settings. Please note that certain features of the KARTRA site or software may not be available if you have cookies disabled. We will typically try to warn you that a page or feature you are trying to reach will not function without cookies enabled. If you have your cookies on your device or browser disabled and are having difficulties you may wish to enable them to see if the problem is resolved.

  4. #### Log Files

As part of standard protocols, KARTRA’s servers automatically gather certain information and store it in log files. This information may includes date/time stamp of access, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, device type, operating system, browser and version, language, log-in details, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring page, exit page, and other data.

These log files are useful for a number of purposes including helping KARTRA to maintain security, measure relative usage, understand and analyze trends regarding users, server access, load, or server problems, more effectively and efficiently administer its sites, products, services, or communications, and gather non-personal demographic information about our users. Consistent with the provisions of this Privacy Policy, KARTRA may use the data in its Log Files in a variety ways useful to its business or to provide better experiences for its users and customers.

  5. #### Social Media

We may collect certain information from you if you interact with us via social media such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, Pinterest, Snapchat, Instagram, and other such services. For example, you may be given the option to register for webinars, take advantage of special offers, or receive mailings, newsletters or the like, via your social media account. The information we receive or collect from such social media, and our ability to collect it, may depend on the social media site, its policies, and its requirements or its technology. We may collect the information you provide from these social media interactions and may use it for various purposes to improve our services or your experience, or to contact you regarding the reason you connected with us, or with additional offers in the future. Of course, you have the opportunity to opt out at any time provided we do not require a means of contacting you to fulfill your request.

  6. #### Children

Protecting children’s privacy is important to KARTRA. It is our policy to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and all other applicable laws. Therefore we restrict our website use to persons eighteen years or older. Therefore, KARTRA does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected or received the personal information of a child under 18 we will take steps to delete the information.

[PLEASE NOTE: You must be 18 or older to use the KARTRA site or software without an adult (parent or guardian).]

DUE TO THE AGE RESTRICTIONS FOR USE OF THIS WEBSITE, NO INFORMATION OBTAINED VIA THIS WEBSITE FALLS WITHIN THE CHILDREN’S ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT (COPPA) AND IT IS NOT MONITORED AS DOING SO.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we discover or form a reasonable belief that we have received any information from a child under 18 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information.
