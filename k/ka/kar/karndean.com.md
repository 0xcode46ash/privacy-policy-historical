A small text file ‘Cookie’, is placed on to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser when you visit our Websites. This file enables us to enhance your current and future visits to the site, improve our service to you and obtain information from you about your internet usage. A cookie will enable our systems to recognise your browser and provide features specific to you. Cookies also enable us to identify whether or not all of the pages which you request are successfully received. All we can do with the cookie is write data to it. We can’t influence or control your computer. 

It is also a tool we can use to aggregate usage statistics about the site. This information enables us to recognise popular site features and further develop new ones, adding to the overall visitor experience of the site. For this we use a programme called Google Analytics, which is purely statistical data generating and cannot be used to find out the identity of a user. Whilst these cookies are anonymous, they do allow us to improve our Websites.

You are able to choose whether you wish cookies to be turned on or off.  The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether.  If you choose to delete cookies or do not have your browser set to accept cookies from Karndean, you will still be able to view the site, however you will not experience a personalised visit nor will you be able to benefit from other personalised site offerings.

Our Websites may contain links to other sites for your convenience and information, including links to our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. We make every effort to ensure that all links are relevant, and that such links are only made to reputable websites. Karndean does not control such websites or their privacy practices, which may differ from our Privacy Policy. We do not endorse or make any representations about third-party websites. The personal data you choose to provide to or that is collected by these third parties is not covered by the Karndean Privacy Policy.

We understand how important your personal information is and how essential it is to ensure that it remains safe and secured. 

We take every precaution to store all data in a controlled, secure environment to be accessed by authorised personnel only. Only Karndean employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to your personal information. The servers on which we store your personal information are kept in a secure environment.
