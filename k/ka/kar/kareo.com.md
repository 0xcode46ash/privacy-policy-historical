Information collection and how it is used 

**General Information**

You do not have to give us any personal information to visit the product information portion of our web site. No personally identifying information (such as your name, e-mail address or Social Security number) will be collected unless you choose to provide that information to us. 

Kareo collects personal information when you sign up for a trial or paid subscription to the Kareo service. When you sign up, we ask for your name, email address, phone number and your company's demographic and financial information such as credit card information. 

When you sign up for a paid subscription, we will ask you to enter your credit card or ACH information. This information is encrypted on computer systems that are secured in a locked cage at a data center co-location facility rented by Kareo. 

Kareo automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address and the page you request. 

Kareo uses information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, billing, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, research, and anonymous reporting. 

Kareo will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account. 

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe by clicking on the link within the email. 

If you sign up for Kareo Patient Portal and elect to use the online patient payment service, your transaction will be processed by Stripe, Inc., and the information you provide to Stripe is subject to its privacy policy. Your credit card number and billing information will not be accessible by Kareo. 

**IP Addresses**

IP Addresses are automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web page or use our service. Your IP address is not permanently stored in a way that is identified with your personal information. 

IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including: 

  * To diagnose or service technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP. 
  * To estimate the total number of users visiting Kareo from specific geographical regions.

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. We do link the information we store in cookies to personal information you submit while on our web site. 

Kareo uses both "session" cookies and “persistent” cookies. A session ID cookie will get removed automatically when you close your web browser. [We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our web site]. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.

Kareo uses software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons) to help us better manage content on our web site by informing us what content is effective. These technologies are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. In some cases we tie information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personal information; an example would be tracking emails that have been opened by recipients which allows us to measure the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.
