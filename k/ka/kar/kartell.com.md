Everyone has the right to protection of his/her personal data. YOOX and Kartell respect its users' right to be informed regarding the collection of and other operations involving their personal data.

**3\. How We Use Personal Data and for What Purposes**   
Your personal data is collected and processed by YOOX and Kartell for purposes which are strictly connected to the use of the web site, its services and to the purchase of products on the web site. However, your personal data may also be used for other processing operations within the limits of such purposes.   
In particular, your personal data shall be processed for the following purposes: 

  * when you register with our website we collect your personal data (for example, your personal details, password, e-mail address, gender) through the registration form (My Account) in order to provide you with services in kartell.comâ€™s reserved access areas and to send you our Newsletter, when specifically requested; 
  * when you require assistance from our Customer Care, we collect your personal data (for example, your name and surnames, e-mail address and password) for purposes strictly necessary to providing you with Customer Care services related to kartell.com services and to the purchase of products on kartell.com; 
  * when you execute purchasing procedures for products sold on kartell.com, we collect your personal data (such as personal details, e-mail address, address, Credit Card numbers, bank code, tax code and telephone number) on your order form only for the purpose of selling the products ordered by you; 
  * when you require technical assistance, we collect your personal data in order to provide you with information on net-surfing, browser compatibility and viewing or loading kartell.com web pages ; 
  * when creating a Wish List, we process your personal data in order to customise our services for the purchase of products on kartell.com.

Your personal data is mostly processed by electronic means and in some circumstances by paper-based means, such as when the processing of your personal data is required for preventing fraud on kartell.com. Your personal data shall be stored in a way which allows YOOX and Kartell to identify you for the period necessary for the purposes which the data was collected for and subsequently processed and, in any case, in accordance with applicable law. Please report any modification of your personal data to [privacy@kartell.com](mailto:privacy@kartell.com) in order to ensure that your personal information is always accurate and up-to-date, relevant and complete.   
Your personal data shall not be disclosed to third parties for purposes which are not permitted by law or without your explicit consent.   
Your personal data may only be disclosed to third parties when it is necessary for processing an order. For example, your personal data is disclosed to Banca Sella S.p.A. for the performance of electronic distance payment services using Credit/Debit Card when you purchase a product on kartell.com. Moreover, your data may be disclosed to the police or to judicial authorities, according to law and upon a formal request by such entities, for example in the event YOOX and Kartell need to prevent fraud on kartell.com (anti-fraud services).   
Data processors will also have access to your personal data as stated in section 2 for the specific purposes stated therein. In all the above circumstances, your consent for data processing is not required. Your personal data will not be transferred abroad to non-EU countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection of individuals. Should this be necessary in order to supply services or to execute a contract for the purchase of products, your personal data shall be transferred to such non-EU countries only after the execution of specific contracts between YOOX, Kartell, and such entities in accordance with applicable law and regulations.   
We wish to inform you that YOOX and Kartell shall process its users' personal data for purposes that are strictly connected to the supply of services on kartell.com, execution of contracts related to the sale and purchase of products on kartell.com and, after receiving your consent, to send you information on new commercial initiatives which are strictly connected to the web site's activities and services.   
YOOX and Kartell shall process your personal data for direct marketing purposes, including by e-mail, only after receiving your consent. YOOX and Kartell may have access to third parties' personal data which was directly disclosed by their users, for example when a user bought a product to be sent to a friend, when the user paying for the product is different from the recipient of the product, or when a user wishes to recommend to a friend a service of kartell.com or the sale of a particular product.   
In all of the above cases, please make sure you receive the consent of such individuals before disclosing their personal data to YOOX and Kartell and make sure you inform them about this Privacy Policy; you will be the only person liable in connection with the disclosure of information and data regarding such third parties if they have not provided you with their express consent for it and for any improper and unlawful use of that information. In any event, YOOX shall fulfil any obligation to inform third parties required by law and, when necessary, shall request their express consent upon registering in its archives the personal information of the user indicated. 

**4\. What Happens if You Do Not Disclose Your Personal Data to YOOX and Kartell**   
Granting your personal data to YOOX and Kartell (in particular, your personal details, your e-mail address, your address, your Credit/Debit Card numbers and bank code and your telephone number) is necessary for processing your order for the purchase of products on kartell.com, supplying other services provided on the web site upon your request, or when your personal information is needed to fulfil obligations required by law or regulations.   
The refusal to provide YOOX and Kartell with some of your personal data necessary for performing the above purposes may consequently prevent YOOX and Kartell from processing your order for the purchase of products sold on kartell.com or from supplying other services provided on kartell.com, such as Customer Care services, sending the Newsletter, using the Wish List or fulfilling obligations required by law and other regulations. Therefore, failing to provide data may constitute, in some cases, a legitimate and justified reason for not processing your order for the purchase of products sold on kartell.com or not providing kartell.comâ€™s services.   
Disclosure of further personal data to YOOX and Kartell other than that required for fulfilling legal or contractual obligations or for providing the services requested, is, on the contrary, optional and does not have any effect on the use of the web site and of its services or on the purchase of products on kartell.com (for example, if we ask you the name of your favourite designer).   
In some circumstances and if required, from time to time we will duly inform you if the personal data you are disclosing to YOOX and Kartell is compulsory or optional. We will point out to you whether the disclosure of your data is compulsory or optional by marking with an appropriate symbol (*) the information that is compulsory or data needed for providing the required services on kartell.com and for the purchase of products on kartell.com. Failing to provide optional personal data will not imply any obligation or disadvantage to our users. 

**5\. To Whom Your Personal Data Will Be Disclosed**   
Personal data will be disclosed to third party companies that provide, on behalf of YOOX and Kartell, specific services as data processors or to other recipients of personal data collected by YOOX and Kartell that autonomously process your personal data only for the performance of a contract for purchasing products on kartell.com (for example, Banca Sella S.p.A.) and only when such purpose does not exceed the purposes for which your personal data was collected and subsequently processed and, in any case, according to applicable laws and regulations.   
Personal data will not be disclosed to third parties or disseminated or transferred without informing our users of such disclosure/dissemination/transfer, without their consent and, in any case, in accordance with the law. 

**6\. How We Collect Your Data on kartell.com**   
When you are using kartell.com, some personal data might be collected automatically (through "cookies"), for example, when we automatically collect users' IP addresses and other information regarding the users' data traffic or the users' preferences in the choice of services provided on this web site and of the products purchased through the provided services. This information and data are collected directly and automatically by the web site as part of its operational functions. This information and data are then processed in a collective and anonymous way for commercial purposes in order to optimize the services provided on kartell.com for the needs and preferences of the web site's users.   
In other circumstances, YOOX and Kartell directly collect personal data and information from its users when they register online with kartell.com or when they send purchase orders of products sold on the web site in order to finalise e-commerce transactions. YOOX and Kartell will process such data only for the purposes and within the limits of what is stated in the section regarding data collection and may be disclosed to third parties only for the purposes related to providing the services requested by the user. 

**7\. Security Measures**   
We have adopted security measures to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, and against all other reasons for data processing that do not comply with our Privacy Policy. Nevertheless, YOOX and Kartell cannot guarantee that the security measures adopted for the protection of the web site and for data and information transmission on kartell.com will prevent or exclude any risk of unauthorised access or of loss of data.   
It is advisable that your computer be provided with software devices that protect network data transmission/receipt (such as updated antivirus systems) and that your Internet service provider take appropriate measures for the security of network data transmission (such as, for example, firewalls and anti-spam filtering). 

**8\. Opt-in/Opt out**   
YOOX and Kartell process your personal data only after receiving your consent, freely expressed, in order to send you advertising material and direct marketing or other commercial communications, including by e-mail, which do not fall within customer requested services provided by kartell.com. Each time your consent is required, we will inform you in advance and we will give you the option to either provide or refuse your consent for the use of your personal data, including your e-mail address, for the above purposes, by ticking the appropriate boxes.   
We wish to inform you that YOOX and kartell.com may process your personal data also without your consent in certain circumstances provided by law, such as when such processing is necessary for performing a legal obligation to which YOOX and kartell.com are subject or when such processing is necessary for performing obligations undertaken in contracts with the users (such as, for example, if you purchased products on kartell.com or if you asked to use specific services through our web site).   
In any case, we wish to inform you that YOOX and Kartell guarantee that its users may exercise, at any time and without having to state their reasoning, their right not to receive future communications connected to particular services upon request. 

**9\. Your Right to Access Personal Data and Further Rights**   
You are entitled to obtain, at any time, confirmation from YOOX and Kartell as to whether or not data relating to you is being processed, whether the data is not yet registered, and the communication in intelligible form of the data undergoing processing.
