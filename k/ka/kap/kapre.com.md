Last Revised: September 2011

This is the Privacy Policy for the Web site of Kaplan Real Estate Education (“KREE Site”). Kaplan Real Estate Education (or “KREE”) is a part of the family of Kaplan companies (“Kaplan”), which are owned and operated by DF Institute, Inc.. This Privacy Policy, which is part of the KREE Site User Agreement, governs your use of the KREE Site.

Your privacy is very important to us and we are committed to protecting it. We understand that our site visitors and registered users need to be in control of their personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how and why we collect personal data from you and how we use it. Our Privacy Policy is designed to ensure that you are aware of how your personal data is being used and to provide you with choices about that use.

We will notify you of any significant change by posting a notice on our home page and information collection forms. Your continued use of the KREE Site after any modification indicates your agreement to the new terms.

  
**Collection and Use of Personal Data**

Personally Identifying Information. When you register for our classes, subscribe to our newsletters, fill out a survey, or request information from the KREE Site, we will use our registration screens and online forms to collect personally identifying information such as your name, address, e-mail address, and credit card information (“personal data”). We may also collect some or all of this personal data from you through our print enrollment forms, or if your employer offers one of our courses. In addition, if you send us an e-mail or communicate with us offline, we may collect the personal data that you voluntarily provide us at that time.

We may use your personal data in the following ways:

  * for the purpose for which you specifically provided the personal data, for example to provide one of our online classes, or to deliver the results of class exams and assignments, or to respond to a specific inquiry;
  * to send surveys or questionnaires so that we can learn more about our customers’ needs and interests;
  * to provide you with information via email about new products or services that we think might interest you.



Anonymous Information. You can visit most pages on the KREE Site without giving us any personal data. Your visit may automatically provide us with anonymous data that is not linked to your personal data, such as your IP (Internet Protocol) address, browser type, operating system, domain name, access times, and referring web site addresses. Some parts of the KREE Site use cookies and embedded pixel technologies to facilitate your use of the Web site and to track general traffic. You can learn more about these anonymous data collection devices in the section entitled Cookies, below.

We use a service provider to track and analyze non-personal data, such as usage and volume statistical information from site visitors. This anonymous data will not be linked to your personal data. We use your anonymous data to obtain general statistics regarding the use of the KREE Site and its specific Web pages and to evaluate how our visitors use and navigate our Web site on an aggregate basis.

In an effort to provide you with the most relevant Web site content and marketing materials, we may also use embedded pixel technologies to help track site usage and response to our marketing campaigns.

If your employer is providing our courses to you, then upon your employer’s request, we will provide your class attendance record and exam results. Otherwise, we share your personal data only with service providers who help us to run the KREE Site or to fulfill your requests. These service providers are restricted from using your personal data in any way other than for the service they are providing. Other than these service providers, KREE does not share your personal data with any other third parties.

We may also need to disclose your personal data to third parties if we, in our sole discretion, believe it is required by law, to enforce our User Agreement or this Privacy Policy, or in connection with a sale or transfer of some or all of our assets in the KREE Site.

**Your California Privacy Rights  
**Last Updated: September, 2011

Beginning on January 1, 2005, California’s “Shine the Light” law provides California residents with the right to receive disclosures about any sharing of their personal information with other companies.

If you are a California resident and you provided your personal information to Anthony Schools, Jones College, Dearborn Real Estate Institute, Leonard-Hawes Real Estate School, Kaplan Real Estate Schools, Kaplan Professional Schools Nevada, Southern Nevada School of Real Estate, Inspection Training Associates, or PROSOURCE Educational Services (collectively “Kaplan Professional Schools”), then, once each calendar year, you may submit a written request for information about the information we shared, if any, with other companies for their use in direct marketing. To submit your written request, please send an E-mail to [http://www.kapre.com/contact](https://web.archive.org/web/20121122082226id_/http%3A//contact) with “Request for California Privacy” in the Requests/Comments section. Please be sure to include your California postal address and to identify which of the Kaplan Professional Schools received your personal data.

Within 30 days of receiving your request, we will send you a list of the categories of personal information disclosed to third parties for third-party direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the names and addresses of these third parties.

We reserve our right not to respond to requests sent more than once in a calendar year, or requests submitted to an address other than the one posted in this notice.

Please note that the California “Shine the Light” law does not cover all information sharing. Our disclosure only includes information covered by the law.

**FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT**

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords eligible students and their parents certain rights with respect to their education records including:

  1. Online student records are maintained for a minimum of 6 years from the end of the award year aid was last awarded or award year the student last attended. Campus student records are retained for a minimum of 5 years from the end of the award year aid was last awarded or award year the student last attended. Academic transcripts are maintained indefinitely.
  

  2. Students have the right to inspect and review their education records during normal school hours with an appointment within 45 days of the day the Campus President/Executive Director receives a written, dated request for access. Kaplan University does not permit students to inspect or review confidential student guidance notes maintained by the University, nor financial records, including any information those records contain, of their parents or guardians.
  

  3. Students have the right to request the amendment of education records that they believe are inaccurate, misleading, or a violation of privacy. A student requesting amendment of an education record should submit a written, dated request to the Campus President/Executive Director, clearly identify the part of the record he or she wants changed, and specify why it is inaccurate, misleading, or a violation of privacy. If the University decides not to amend the record, the University will notify the student of the decision and the student’s right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing.
  

  4. Students have the right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student’s education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without prior consent from the parents or the eligible student, as applicable. The University may neither release nor disclose personally identifiable information contained in the student’s education records to outside employers, agencies, or individuals without first securing a written release from the parent or eligible student, as applicable, unless permitted by the Act. One exception to the above student record release policy permits disclosure without consent to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position, including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff, or a person or company with whom the University is affiliated or has contracted such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill a professional responsibility. Upon request, the University discloses educational records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll.
  

  5. Students have the right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the University to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the office that administers FERPA is:



Family Compliance Office  
U.S. Department of Education  
400 Maryland Avenue, SW  
Washington, DC 20202-4605

The rights afforded to, and consent required of, parents under this Act transfer from the parents to the student once the student becomes eligible.

**DIRECTORY INFORMATION PUBLIC NOTICE**

In accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), Kaplan University maintains an online directory for the University community. Upon the first day of attendance at the University, students’ profile listings, including student names and user names, become available to the University community (students, faculty, and administrators). The online directory may also include information commonly referred to as “directory information.” The University designates the following categories of student information as directory information:

  * Name
  * Address Telephone number
  * Email address
  * Photographic representations of students
  * Field of study
  * Grade level
  * Enrollment status
  * Dates of attendance at the University
  * Degrees, honors, and awards received
  * Participation in officially recognized campus activities



The University does not accept responsibility for information published by users in the directory and reserves the right to delete or modify information posted to the directory that is abusive, inflammatory, defamatory, infringing of intellectual property, or otherwise inappropriate in an academic environment. Students who improperly use the directory or any information it contains may be subject to disciplinary action. Students have the ability to enter or restrict the listing of personal directory information through an online user interface. Upon withdrawal from the University, student directory information will be removed. Upon graduation from the University, student directory information will become eligible for inclusion in an alumni directory. Additionally, the University may release directory information to third parties without prior consent of students. Directory information may be disclosed by the University at its discretion for any purpose including, but not limited to, requests from law enforcement agencies and degree verification requests from prospective employers. Currently enrolled students may choose to withhold disclosure of their directory information by obtaining the Directory Information Withholding Request Form from the Campus Registrar (onsite) or the Kaplan University Office of the Registrar (online), completing the form, and returning it to the Campus Registrar/Kaplan University Office of the Registrar. The University will honor a student’s request to withhold directory information; however, cannot assume responsibility for subsequently contacting the student for permission to release information to prospective employers, relatives, or other persons. The failure on the part of any student to specifically request that his or her directory information be withheld indicates individual approval for disclosure. Additionally, the student’s request to withhold directory information will not affect previous disclosures made by the University prior to receipt of the request.
