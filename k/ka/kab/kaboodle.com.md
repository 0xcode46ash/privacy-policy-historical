**Emails Sent To Kaboodle**  
If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you. 

**Use of Personal Information**  
As Kaboodle is a free site, we may use your bookmarks to improve our marketing and promotional efforts by providing targeted advertising based on the content of the lists. 

On an aggregate, non-personally identifiable level we may also use this data to analyze site usage and customize the Site's content, layout, and services. These uses improve the Site and better tailor it to meet your needs, so as to provide you with a smooth, efficient, safe and customized experience while using the Site. 

As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide our services:

  * **Advertisers**. We aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) personal information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally.
  * **Kaboodle Community**. Your User ID, bookmarks and any content you generate via message boards are displayed throughout the Site. Therefore this data is available to the public. All of your activities on the Site will be identifiable to your User ID. Other people can see your bookmarks, comments, and any other lists you have created on the Kaboodle service.
  * **Legal Requests**. Kaboodle cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights, to help protect you and the Kaboodle community from those doing harm. Therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your user ID, email, bookmarks, and site usage history without a subpoena.



If you are participating in the Kaboodle service, we may send emails to you from time to time indicating updates to the Kaboodle service and soliciting your feedback. If you do not wish to receive emails from Kaboodle, you may indicate so within your email preferences, when preferences become available on the Kaboodle system.

**Use of Email and Address Book**  
You may not use the email feature that we offer to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our Terms of Service. We may permanently store email addresses sent from these tools for the purpose of simplifying future emails you wish to send out. We do not read the content of these emails.

If you send and email using the service to an email address that is not registered in our community, we do not use that email address for any purpose other than to send your email. We do not rent or sell these email addresses. We do not market to these emails in any way as a direct result of your submission of their email.

Other users may send emails to you via the Kaboodle service. Kaboodle does not review these messages before they are sent to you. In the future, Kaboodle will provide you with a means of blocking emails from specific users you designate.
