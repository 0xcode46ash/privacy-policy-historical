  * ## Security of Customer Information

Kabbage stores and processes customer information using our own secure data servers as well as third party servers located in secure data centers in the United States. Customer information is protected by physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable federal and state regulations. Kabbage uses computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and authorizes access to customer information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.

Kabbage never stores payment or related customer data at its office. Instead of storing payment information on company systems, Kabbage stores this information in PCI-compliant and PA-DSS certified data centers residing within the banking and processing network. Kabbage encrypts and securely transmits customer payment information to the banking network at the time of initial payment acceptance. Kabbage receives the response along with a "payment token" that it uses to reference that transaction for any future billing action. Kabbage stores only this secure token.

  * ## Use of Information

Kabbage's primary purpose in collecting customer information is to establish a safe, smooth, efficient and customized experience and allow customers to take full advantage of our products and services. Kabbage uses customer information to (1) provide services and support; (2) process transactions and send notifications regarding general operation of the service; (3) resolve disputes, collect fees and troubleshoot problems; (4) prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; (5) enforce our Merchant Cash Advance Agreement or Loan Agreement; (6) customize, measure and improve our services; (7) update the content and layout of our website; and, (8) compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties.
