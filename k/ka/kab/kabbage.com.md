######  The USA Patriot Act

The USA Patriot Act has paved the way for financial institutions to help prevent fraud, identity theft, and the spread of terrorism. It requires financial institutions to obtain more information from an individual or legal entity to help establish identity.

Your cooperation is needed when you open a new account or request a loan. You may be asked more questions to establish and confirm your identity. It may also be required for you to provide one or more of the following types of identification:

  * Driverâ€™s License
  * Passport & Country of Issuance
  * U.S. taxpayer Identification (ID) Number
  * Alien ID Card
  * Any other government issued document evidencing nationality or residence

Kabbage collects certain information from your browser using small data files called "cookies" Kabbage uses session ID cookies to confirm that customers are logged in. This type of cookie helps Kabbage recognize a customer if he or she visits multiple pages on our website during the same session, so that we do not need to require a password to access each page. These cookies terminate once the customer closes the browser. By default, Kabbage uses a persistent cookie that stores customer login ID (but not password) to make it easier for the customer to login when returning to our website. Kabbage encodes its cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. You may remove or block this cookie using your browser settings to disable the feature.

Kabbage also stores transaction history. Kabbage may collect additional information in ways not specifically described here. For example, we may track information related to interactions with customer service or responses from surveys or other feedback tools. We use this information to continually improve the service we provide our customers.

* * *

Kabbage's Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by our partners and affiliates. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners and affiliates may use session ID cookies to provide a custom user experience and to track the success of our partnership with them.

* * *

Our web pages contain electronic images known as "web beacons" (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our website is used. Web beacons may also be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links recipients have opened, allowing us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.

* * *

Kabbage stores and processes customer information using our own secure data servers as well as third party servers located in secure data centers in the United States. Customer information is protected by physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable federal and state regulations. Kabbage uses computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and authorizes access to customer information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.

Kabbage never stores payment or related customer data at its office. Instead of storing payment information on company systems, Kabbage stores this information in PCI-compliant and PA-DSS certified data centers residing within the banking and processing network. Kabbage encrypts and securely transmits customer payment information to the banking network at the time of initial payment acceptance. Kabbage receives the response along with a "payment token" that it uses to reference that transaction for any future billing action. Kabbage stores only this secure token.

* * *

Kabbage's primary purpose in collecting customer information is to establish a safe, smooth, efficient and customized experience and allow customers to take full advantage of our products and services. Kabbage uses customer information to (1) provide services and support; (2) process transactions and send notifications regarding general operation of the service; (3) resolve disputes, collect fees and troubleshoot problems; (4) prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; (5) enforce our Merchant Cash Advance Agreement or Loan Agreement; (6) customize, measure and improve our services; (7) update the content and layout of our website; and, (8) compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties.

In addition, you may have authorized Kabbage to share data back to a service provider who you previously authorized to share data with Kabbage. Kabbage obtains assurances that these parties are properly licensed and regulated and only use customer information in connection with the services they perform for Kabbage or as you may have otherwise authorized. Kabbage may, from time to time, exchange information with third parties to determine the feasibility of a partnership. Our partners are required by contract with us to adhere to our Privacy Policy and implement the same safeguards for protecting customer information.

Kabbage may share customer information with law enforcement, a State insurance authority, the Federal Trade Commission, self-regulatory organizations, or for an investigation on a matter related to public safety, to comply with Federal, State, or local laws, rules, and other applicable legal requirements; to comply with a properly authorized civil, criminal, or regulatory investigation or subpoena or summons by Federal, State, or local authorities; to respond to judicial process or government regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over the financial institution for examination, compliance, to report suspected illegal activity, to investigate any breach of our Merchant Cash Advance Agreement, Loan Agreement, or other agreement you have with Kabbage, or other purposes as authorized by law.
