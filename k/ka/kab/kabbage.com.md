# Kabbage Privacy Policy | Kabbage

Kabbage's Privacy Policy describes the ways we collect, store, use and protect user information. We may amend this policy at any time by posting a revised version on our website. The revised version will be effective at the time we post it.

By using or accessing Kabbage, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

##  Information Collected

Kabbage collects two types of information: personal information that users knowingly disclose to Kabbage and website-use information automatically generated by users as they interact with the site.

##  Personal Information

When users sign up for Kabbage, they are asked to provide profile information such as name, address, phone number, email address, preferences and other similar information. Kabbage may also collect certain financial information, including bank account numbers and routing numbers for funding and repayment purposes. We also collect tokens from online marketplaces and payment systems such as eBay and PayPal.

Kabbage may also require users to provide additional information to help verify identity or address or manage risk, such as date of birth, social security number or other information. Kabbage may also obtain information about users from third parties such as the Social Security Administration or identity verification services.

##  Website-Use Information

Kabbage collects certain information from user's browsers using small data files called “cookies.” Kabbage uses session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. This type of cookie helps Kabbage recognize a user if he or she visits multiple pages on our site during the same session, so that we do not need to require a password to access each page. These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser. By default, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID (but not your password) to make it easier for you to login when you come back to Kabbage. We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. Users can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable the feature.

Kabbage also stores transaction history and user relationships/interactions. Users can request working capital and send money using Kabbage. We collect this information so that we can provide users with a meaningful service.

Kabbage may collect additional information in other ways not specifically described here. For example, we may collect information related to interactions with customer service or responses from surveys or other feedback tools.

##  Use of Information Obtained by Kabbage

Kabbage's primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide users with a safe, smooth, efficient and customized experience and allow them to take full advantage of our products and services. Kabbage uses this information to provide services and support; process transactions and send notifications regarding general operation of the service, such as messages or reminders, resolve disputes, collect fees and troubleshoot problems; prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities and enforce our User Agreement; customize, measure and improve our services and the content and layout of our website; compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties.

Kabbage will never share a user's financial information with other customers.

##  Storage of Personal Information

Kabbage stores and processes user information using third party servers located in secure data centers in the US. This information is protected by physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable US federal and state regulations. Kabbage uses computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption and authorizes access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.

Kabbage never stores payment or related personal data at its office. Instead of storing payment information on company systems, Kabbage stores this information in PCI-compliant and PA-DSS certified data centers residing within the banking and processing network. Kabbage encrypts and securely transmits user payment information to the banking network at the time of initial payment acceptance. Kabbage receives the response along with a “payment token” that it uses to reference that transaction for any future billing action. Kabbage stores only this secure token.

##  Sharing of Personal Information with Third Parties

Kabbage may share personal information with third-party service providers under contract who help with certain parts of our business operations including decisioning, customer services, payment, fraud prevention, secure data storage and other similar services. Kabbage ensures that these parties are properly licensed and regulated and only use personal information in connection with the services they perform for Kabbage.

Kabbage may share personal information in the event of a merger or acquisition. Should such an event occur, Kabbage will require that the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with respect to personal information. If personal information could be used contrary to this policy, users will receive prior notice.

Kabbage may be compelled to share personal information to law enforcement, government officials or other third parties in the event of a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure or when Kabbage believes in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity or to investigate violations of our User Agreement.

Kabbage will not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties in the normal course of doing business and only shares your personal information with third parties as described in this policy, unless we implement a policy change and inform you of such change.
