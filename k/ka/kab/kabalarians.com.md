Our policy is that all the information you provide us is kept **strictly private and confidential** and is used **only** in preparing your Name Report. We do not in any way sell, trade, or distribute any personal information, address, e-mail, or telephone numbers with any organizations, governments, or companies.

We protect the personal information you share with us. For example, if you make an online purchase with us, we encrypt your credit card number. Access to your personal information is limited to people who need it to do their job. 

Authorized third-party agents may also need access to some of your personal information. For example, if we need to ship something to you, we must share your name and address with a shipping company. We provide third-party agents only with the minimum amount of information needed to complete the requested service or transaction. We do not otherwise share your personal information with third-parties, unless you have granted us permission to do so.
