# Privacy Policy

kgb.com provides this Privacy Policy to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information received from users of this Web site, located at kgb.com ("Site" ). This policy is only applicable to the kgb.com site(s) and not to the third party Web sites to which we might provide links. We are committed to providing the highest quality search experience for our users. In order to provide the highest quality service, we do collect some personal information from and may invite you to provide personal information if you so choose. We are committed to ensuring that all your personal information that is collected is kept private and protected. We will ensure that our Web site is absolutely secure in its collection and use of your personal information. 

By using our Site you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. "Processing" means using cookies on a computer or using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing information, all of which activities will take place in the United States. If you reside outside the U.S. your personally identifiable information will be transferred to the U.S., and processed and stored there under U.S. privacy standards. By visiting our Site and providing information to us, you consent to such transfer to, and processing in, the US. 

Information Collection and Use

Our primary goals in collecting personally identifiable information are to provide you with the product and services made available through the Site, including, but not limited, to the Service, to communicate with you, and to manage your registered user account, if you have one. 

Information Collected Upon Registration. You will not be required to provide personally identifiable information in order to access and use our search service. We do not ask search users for their name, email or mailing address or phone numbers. 

If you desire to have access to certain features of the Site, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to kgb.com. Personally identifiable information that we may collect in such instances may include your IP address, full user name, password, email address, city, time zone, telephone number, and other information that you decide to provide us with, or that you decide to include in your public profile. 

Additional Information. Your full user name and your photo, if you decide to upload one, may be displayed to people in the kgb.com network, as specified in your privacy settings. Once a member, you may provide additional information in the profile section, including but not limited to your bio, your location, as well as your personal web site, if you have one. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself and find new people and places in the kgb.com network. If you contact us by email through the Site, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to us in your message, to respond to you. 

Use of Contact Information. Information such as your full name, profile photo and any personally identifiable information you have included in your reviews may be shown to friends or other users primarily in conjunction with reviews you have contributed. 

Your full name and email address may also be used when you send an email notification to a friend (such as when sharing a listing or itinerary). We may also use your email address to send you updates or news regarding our site, but you may choose not to receive email of this type by accessing the "Account" tab of the web site and updating your notification settings. Additionally, we use your email address to contact you on behalf of your friends (such as when someone sends you a personal message). 

We may use your contact information to market to you, and provide you with information about, our products and services, including but not limited to our Service. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such information or communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications. 

Log Data. When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a Web site ("Log Data" ). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, timestamp data or the domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. 

We use Log Data to monitor the use of the Site and of our Service, and for the Site's technical administration. In addition, we use this information to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, their listing or advertisements. We do not associate your IP address with any other personally identifiable information to identify you personally, except in case of violation of the Terms of Service. 

Cookies

Like many Web sites, we also use "cookie" technology to collect additional Web site usage data and to improve the Site and our Service. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk. We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. 

kgb.com may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Site and our Service, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Site and our services. A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and our Service and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Site. 

A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the Web sites you visit. Please visit your Browser's help file for details. 

Information Sharing and Disclosure 

Service Providers. We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance, customer relationship, database storage and management, and direct marketing campaigns. We will share your personally identifiable information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and security of your data. 

Third Party Suppliers. Certain sponsored and/or unsponsored links contained within kgb.com's automated search results may be provided by third party suppliers. We may pass your query on to one or more of these suppliers when you submit a query to us. We will not, however, pass any personally identifiable information about you, with the exception of any information which you deem fit to include in your query. Since we do not control such third parties we cannot accept any responsibility for their use of any information. 

Aggregate Data. We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated data which are not of a personal nature. This may include, but is not limited to, the numbers of users that clicked on a particular advertisement or searched for a particular term. You will not be personally identified by such information. 

Links to Other Websites 

Our Site contains links to other Web sites. You may find these links in advertisements, in search results, and in other areas of our site. The fact that we link to a Web site is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party Web sites. These other Web sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personally identifiable information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personally identifiable information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other Web sites you visit. 

The kgb.com Sites may contain content and advertisements on behalf of third parties who perform user activity tracking other than that described in this privacy policy. Please refer to the third party advertiserâ€™s privacy policy for more information about their practices, cookies, and how to "opt-out". 

kgb.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of other Web sites to which we might provide a link. Please be aware when you leave our site and read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy policy applies only to information collected by this Web site. 

E-mail and Ad Serving

We may use third party service providers to serve ads and e-mails on our behalf. These third parties may use technologies to assess the effectiveness of ads and e-mails and use information about your visits to the kgb.com Site for the purpose of enhancing your search experience. We may also provide anonymous information about your site navigation to these third party service providers. 

Tell-A-Friend. If you decide to inform a friend about any of our sites using our referral service, we will ask for your friend's name and e-mail address. We will automatically send your friend an e-mail inviting them to visit the kgb.com Site. However, kgb.com will not store the information related to your friend and the email we send following your request will be our only contact with that person. 

Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement

kgb.com cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of kgb.com or a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law. 

Business Transfers

kgb.com may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your personally identifiable information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if the new entity's planned processing of your information differs materially from that set forth in this Privacy Policy. 

Feedback Form 

The kgb.com site provides you with the ability to provide suggestions and comments, or to highlight other issues affecting the Service. We will ask for your name and email address in order to follow up with you or to thank you for a suggestion, but we will not use this information for any other purposes. We may, however, keep certain information so that we can track whether problems or issues are of a recurring nature. 

Notification Rights 

When you register for certain services we may ask you to provide personal information. If we intend to use this information for a purpose other than that for which it was collected we will ask for your consent prior to such use. 

If we propose to use your personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service notices, we will offer you the ability to opt out of the use of your personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect and/or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent 

You may decline to submit personal information to any of our services, although if you do this kgb may not be able to provide those services to you. 

Account Modification

If you are a registered user of the Site, you may access and update or correct the information you provided to us by visiting the My Account section of the site. 

Security 

kgb.com is very concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. 

We will make any legally-required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored personal data to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable information without their consent, he or she should contact us at [help@kgb.com](mailto:help@kgb.com).
