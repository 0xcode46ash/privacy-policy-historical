We do collect non-personal information, such as your browser type and IP address. Knowledge Hound uses this information to help diagnose problems and to administer and improve our site. We may provide aggregate information (such as the number of visitors from a particular country) to third parties when this information is required during the course of business. We may share this non-personal information in the event that we merge with or are acquired by another company.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit us. These companies may use information gathered from your visits to Knowledge Hound and other websites in order to provide advertisements for goods and services of interest to you. This information does **not** include your name, address, email address, or telephone number. Knowledge Hound does not have access to this information.

The third-party companies include Google, ValueClick and Chitika. Google enables users to manage their ad settings or to opt-out [here](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).
