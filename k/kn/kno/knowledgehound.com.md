# Knowledge Hound Privacy Policy

Knowledge Hound, LLC is committed to respecting the privacy of our users. This policy details what information may be collected during a visit to our site and what we do with that information.

We do not collect personally identifiable information from our users unless they use our contact forms or sign up for our [newsletter](https://web.archive.org/web/20081220221722id_/http%3A//www.knowledgehound.com/newsltr/newslett.htm). Contact form information is used solely to respond to a user's request. We **do not** sell personal data.

We do collect non-personal information, such as your browser type and IP address. Knowledge Hound uses this information to help diagnose problems and to administer and improve our site. We may provide aggregate information (such as the number of visitors from a particular country) to potential advertisers. We may share this non-personal information in the event that we merge with or are acquired by another company.

We display advertisements for third parties. These ads sometimes place cookies (small data files) on a user's hard drive to gather non-personal data. For example, cookies are used to ensure that our visitors only see one popunder advertisement per 12 hour period. These cookies are not placed, tracked or retrieved by us. We do not have access to the information gathered by the cookies.

For users wishing to avoid cookies, most browsers can be set to reject them. Please be aware that this may result in a popunder ad loading each time a page is viewed.

The companies we work with are of the highest caliber. You can view their privacy policies below:
