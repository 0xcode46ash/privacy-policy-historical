# 'One Smart Puppy' Newsletter Privacy Policy

NEWSLETTER PRIVACY POLICY

* * *

For the convenience and security of our subscribers and our company, Knowledge Hound's 'One Smart Puppy' newsletter subscriber list is hosted and managed by [MailerMailer.com](http://www.mailermailer.com/).

#### Newsletter Subscriber List Information Collection

We collect the information that is requested on the newsletter signup form. We may collect the domain name or IP address of the subscriber as proof of signup in the event that we are accused of sending unsolicited email. We may collect clickstream information, which tells us what you have clicked on. (For our Website Privacy Policy, click [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20071210215600id_/http%3A//www.knowledgehound.com/privacy.htm).) We may collect information volunteered by you in the form of survey information. Newsletters may include information from third party providers for products and services which may be advertised or promoted within the newsletter. The privacy policies of those third-party provider sites govern the method by which they collect and use information.

#### Use Of Information Collected

The information we collect may be used to create an aggregate demographic profile of our user base so that we can improve content and services and provide aggregate information to potential advertisers (no individual information is provided to any third-party without your consent), to customize the content and/or layout of our newsletter, to notify you about updates or disruptions to our web site and/or services and to send you our newsletter. We may share information with another company in the event that we merge with or are acquired by another company. Upon request, we will provide you with the information (e.g., email address, name, etc.) that we maintain about you.

#### To Unsubscribe

If you subscribed to our newsletter but do not want to receive it in the future, please follow the "unsubscribe" instructions contained in the newsletter, which includes an individualized link to your subscription information.

#### Security

We and MailerMailer.com, providers of the email list management service used for this list, strive to maintain appropriate security measures in our respective physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you. Although we and MailerMailer take reasonable measures to secure our data, we cannot guarantee that the measures taken are or will remain adequate.

#### Changes to Newsletter Privacy Policy

In the unlikely event that we decide to use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in this Newsletter Privacy Policy notice, we will post the policy changes to this Newsletter Privacy Policy page to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of our list. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check this Newsletter Privacy Policy page periodically.
