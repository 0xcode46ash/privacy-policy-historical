# Knowledge Hound Privacy Policy

Knowledge Hound is committed to respecting the privacy of our users. This policy details what information may be collected during a visit to our site and what we do with that information.

First, we never collect personally identifiable information from our users unless they contact us. Even then, any information that we receive is used solely to respond to a user's request. We **do not** sell any user information.

We do collect non-personal information, such as your browser type and IP address. Knowledge Hound uses this information to help diagnose problems and to administer and improve our site. We may provide aggregate information (such as the number of visitors from a particular country) to third-parties when this information is required during the course of business. We may share this non-personal information in the event that we merge with or are acquired by another company.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements for goods and services of interest to you. Knowledge Hound does not have access to this information.

One of the third-party companies that we work with is Google. Google enables users to manage their ad settings or to opt-out [here](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

Should changes occur that affect this policy, we will update this document to reflect the changes. Thanks for visiting!
