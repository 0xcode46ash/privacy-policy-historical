The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for KnowThis.com, a service operated by KnowThis LLC ("KnowThis"). KnowThis is strongly committed to maintaining the high standards of privacy for all users of our service. 

**USER PROVIDED INFORMATION**  
KnowThis does not sell or make available for rental to third parties any information provided by its users. 

KnowThis requires users of certain services, including the online Marketing Forums, to provide certain information as part of the registration process for gaining access to the service.  Anyone registering must provide a username, password and email address.  If a service requires payment, all payment related information is handled by a third-party payment processor.  Payment information is transmitted through Secure Socket Layer technology throughout the entire purchase process to protect users. Credit card information is not captured by KnowThis nor is it stored on this site.

For services requiring registration, information such as email address, may be used to provide communication between registered users and KnowThis such as confirming your registration, providing reminders of registration or payment status, offering service renewal notices, occasionally sending updated information about KnowThis, and sending requests for feedback that are designed to improve the services provided by KnowThis.  Because this information is vital to operating certain services offered by KnowThis, an opt-out option for communication from KnowThis may not be available to users.

For certain services offered by KnowThis, including the online Marketing Forums, registered members have the option to have their email address be viewable to other members.  Additionally, registered members of the Marketing Forums may elect to provide additional personal and professional information.  If a member elects to provide this information it may be viewable to other members.
