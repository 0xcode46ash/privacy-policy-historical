  9.  **Customer Data**



SAVO Customers use the Service to host data and information (“Customer Data”). SAVO will not review, share, distribute, or reference any such Customer Data except as provided in the SAVO Application Services Agreement (or similar services agreement), or as may be required by Legal Processes, and will host Customer Data solely to facilitate the processing and use of the Customer Data by its Customers. Individual records of Customer Data may be viewed or accessed by SAVO only for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issues, or suspected violation of the SAVO Application Services Agreement, or as may be required by Legal Processes. Customers are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of their SAVO usernames and passwords. Customers maintaining Customer Data that constitutes personally identifiable information subject to the protections of the European Union’s Data Protection Directive will remain responsible for such information vis-à-vis the individual in accordance with the relevant EU provisions, although, as set forth in the SAVO Application Services Agreement, SAVO will cooperate with the Customer as may be necessary to ensure that individuals’ rights to access and correct such information are respected. SAVO permanently deletes or destroys Customer Data residing on its servers promptly upon the termination of a Customer relationship.

 **Information Related to Data Collected for our Clients**

SAVO Group acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal information.   SAVO collects information under the direction of its Clients, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes.  If you are a customer of one of our Clients and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Clients that use our service, please contact the Client that you interact with directly.  We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service.  Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Clients.

 **Access and Retention of Data Controlled by our Clients**

SAVO has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his or her query to SAVO’s Client (the data controller).  If the Client requests SAVO to remove the data, we will respond to their request within 30 days.

We will retain personal data we process on behalf of our Clients for as long as needed to provide services to our Client.  SAVO will retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

 **Security**

SAVO uses industry standard security measures to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and help ensure the appropriate use of Customer Data. The Service can be accessed only by Internet Explorer version 8.0 or later, Firefox version 2.0 or later, or Safari version 3.0 or later, because these browsers permit the use of Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) technology (formerly Secure Socket Layer or SSL technology) that protects Customer Data using both server authentication and data encryption. These technologies help ensure that Customer Data is safe, secure, and only available to the Customer to whom the information belongs and those to whom the Customer has granted access. SAVO also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and the Company hosts its SAVO Digital Properties in a secure server environment that uses firewalls and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. SAVO also offers enhanced security features within the Service that permit Customers to configure security settings to the level they deem necessary.

Because the Company uses the Service to maintain data about Visitors, Data About SAVO Customers and Web Site Navigational Information, this information is secured in the same manner as described above for Customer Data. To the extent that SAVO provides Data About SAVO Customers and Web Site Navigational Information to its agents, partners or service providers, as described in Section 6 of this Privacy Policy, SAVO takes commercially reasonable steps to ensure that its agents, partners or service providers either abide by SAVO’s privacy practices as reflected in this Privacy Policy or by substantially equivalent policies.

Although we strive to make security a priority, note that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.  If you have any questions about security on the Company’s Digital Properties, you can contact supportdesk@savogroup.com.

  11.  **Social Media Widgets**



Our Company’s Digital Properties include Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
