## The Gist

KnowlegeOwl will collect certain non-personally identifiable information about you as you use our sites. We may use this data to better understand our users. We can also publish this data, but the data will be about a large group of users, not individuals. We may also collect certain personal information about you and your use of the Service (as defined herein) which may be published and used in the aggregate as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

We will also ask you to provide personal information, but you'll always be able to opt out. If you give us personal information, we won't do anything evil with it.

We can also use cookies, but you can choose not to store these.

That's the basic idea, but you must read through the entire Privacy Policy below and agree with all the details before you use any of our sites.

## Reuse

This document is based upon the [Baremetrics Privacy Policy](https://baremetrics.com/privacy) which is based on the [Automattic Privacy Policy](http://automattic.com/privacy/) and is licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike License 2.5](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/). Basically, this means you can use it verbatim or edited, but you must release new versions under the same license and you have to credit Baremetrics and Automattic somewhere (like this!).  Neither Automattic nor Baremetrics is connected with nor sponsors or endorses KnowledgeOwl or its use of the work.

KnowledgeOwl makes available services include our web sites (http://www.knowledgeowl.com.com (the "Site")), our blog, our API, and any other software, sites, and services offered by KnowledgeOwl in connection to any of those (taken together, the "Service"). It is KnowledgeOwl's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our Site.

## Questions

If you have question about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at support@knowledgeowl.com

## Visitors

Like most website operators, KnowledgeOwl collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. KnowledgeOwl's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how KnowledgeOwl's visitors use its website. From time to time, KnowledgeOwl may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

KnowledgeOwl also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. KnowledgeOwl does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. We may also collect and use IP addresses to block users who violated our Terms and Conditions.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to KnowledgeOwl's websites choose to interact with KnowledgeOwl in ways that require KnowledgeOwl to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that KnowledgeOwl gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. KnowledgeOwl collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with KnowledgeOwl. KnowledgeOwl does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Service-related activities.

Additionally, some interactions, such as posting a comment, may ask for optional personal information. For instance, when posting a comment, a user may provide a website that will be displayed along with a user's name when the comment is displayed. Supplying such personal information is completely optional and is only displayed for the benefit and the convenience of the user.

## Aggregated Statistics

KnowledgeOwl may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to and users of the Service. For instance, KnowledgeOwl may monitor the most popular parts of the KnowledgeOwl Site. KnowledgeOwl may display this information in the aggregate publicly or provide it to others.

In addition, KnowledgeOwl may, from time to time, collect certain personal information from you, your use of the Services, and/or the users of your website, such as your number of active users, number of active readers, article views and other metrics (your “Data”). KnowledgeOwl may publish and display your Data in the aggregate to the public through our Site or on our blog, e.g. by publishing a report on average article views on the Site. However, all Data is only used and published in the aggregate which means that any published Data will not identify you, your website, your company or your users, or link you to the published information in any way. If you wish to opt out of the publication of your Data, please contact us as support@knowledgeowl.com.

KnowledgeOwl does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

KnowledgeOwl discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on KnowledgeOwl's behalf or to provide services available at KnowledgeOwl's Site websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Service, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. KnowledgeOwl will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, KnowledgeOwl discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when KnowledgeOwl believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of KnowledgeOwl, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the Service and have supplied your email address, KnowledgeOwl may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with KnowledgeOwl and our products. We primarily use our website and blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. KnowledgeOwl takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the Service each time the visitor returns. KnowledgeOwl uses cookies to help KnowledgeOwl identify and track visitors, their usage of the KnowledgeOwl Service, and their Service access preferences. KnowledgeOwl visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using KnowledgeOwl's websites, with the drawback that certain features of KnowledgeOwl's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## Business Transfers

If KnowledgeOwl, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that KnowledgeOwl goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of KnowledgeOwl may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

## Data Storage

KnowledgeOwl uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Service. You understand that although you retain full rights to your data, it may be stored on third party storage and transmitted through third party networks.

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, KnowledgeOwl may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in KnowledgeOwl's sole discretion. KnowledgeOwl encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.
