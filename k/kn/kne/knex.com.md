PARENT ZONE PRIVACY POLICY

The Parents Zone section of www.knex.com is committed to offering you, the parent, helpful and educational information regarding building sets, K'NEX products and the K'NEX website. This section of the site also offers you the opportunity to enter contests and giveaways, and to enroll for email updates that will inform you of new content and offers recently added to the [Parent Zone](https://web.archive.org/parentzone/index.php) and [Catalog](http://www.knex.com/customer/home.php) sections of the site. 

Please know that any information collected in conjunction with any of these opportunities will be strictly used for only the intention it was collected. Never, in any case, do we sell or distribute information gathered to anyone, nor do we make our mailing lists available to anyone. We might, however, use this information in conjunction with a marketing partner, where we control when and how we use the information. Any information used in this specific manner would be in the categorized and generic format, and not individual names, email addresses, etc.

GENERAL PRIVACY POLICY

Please take note of this important information! Guidelines have been established by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (called COPPA) to protect the on-line privacy of children, to make clear what is advertising, and what, and how, information may be gathered from on-line users who are children. K'NEX is committed to complying with these guidelines and regulations for online privacy and security. We'd like you to review this web site to make sure you're satisfied with our approach and presentation. K'NEX does not want to collect any information that you, as a parent, are uncomfortable having your child submit to us.

This web site is operated by: 

K'NEX Industries  
2990 Bergey Road  
Hatfield, PA 19440  
1-800-KID-KNEX (1-800-543-5639) (Consumer Relations)  
Email@knex.com (Consumer Relations)  
1-215-997-7722 (Main Offices)

COPPA includes a child's email address in its definition of "personal information."

If you, as a parent, consent to our collection and use of your child's personal information, as we describe in this Privacy Policy, it does not mean you are consenting to the disclosure of that information to any outside third party. To do so, we would first need your explicit approval to do so.

COPPA prohibits us, and any company, from conditioning your child's participation in any activity on our Web site in exchange for the disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in any activity. We agree with and adhere to this rule.

You, as a parent, are automatically informed by email when your child contacts us via the K'NEX Web site. The personal information we have collected from your child via email contact is as follows: the child's first name, email address, and your email address. We occasionally have surveys and contests, where we may ask, in addition, for age, and gender. You have the right to delete all of this personal information from our records at any time. You may do so by clicking the "unsubscribe" link below.

<http://www.knex.com/includes/unsubscribe.php>  


Once we have received and processed your request, you will receive an email notifying you that all of your child's information has been deleted from our database.   
We have indicated above what personal information about your child is in our email database. The "unsubscribe" procedure will remove all information from our database. If you have further comments, questions or concerns about your child's personal information in our email database, or any other concerns, please contact us at our free Consumer Relations phone: 1-800-KID-KNEX (1-800-543-5639), or email us at: email@knex.com.

Personal information is solicited only on a voluntary basis; it is not required to visit the K'NEX site, and there are many things to interest and entertain at the site without any registration. If your child indicates a desire to receive emails from us regarding new changes on the site, contests at the site, special access sections of the site, and new products, etc., we will of course be using the supplied email address. You, or your child, can terminate these email updates by using the unsubscribe procedure described above.

If your child has indicated in an email to us a problem with a K'NEX product, or has a question regarding the K'NEX toy, or the company, or its people, etc., we may categorize and collect that information in generic categories, so that we can correct problems with the product or instructions, or address concerns, on our website FAQ's. We do not keep that information based upon the personal information supplied.

Other than that, we will use any personal information you or your child give us only in the following circumstances:

• If we need to respond to an e-mail inquiry.

• If your child has entered a K'NEX on-line contest and won, we will need an actual address to send the prize; notification will be sent to the parent's e-mail address.

If you or your child sign up to receive K'NEX information or product updates, we will send an e-mail notification to the parent's e-mail address, with instructions on how to remove the child's e-mail address from the e-mail list, if you so wish. The surveys and contests, where we may ask for age and gender of the child, tell us things we would like to know about K'NEX users. This information is valuable in developing products we believe you and your child will like. We're always interested in comments from consumers. We use the generic, categorized data to help guide our marketing; too, so we can be certain advertising and information get to the real K'NEX fans.

Never, in any case, do we sell or distribute information gathered to anyone, nor do we make our mailing lists available to anyone. We might, however, use this information in conjunction with a marketing partner, where we control when and how we use the information. Any information used in this specific manner would be in the categorized and generic format, and not individual names, email addresses, etc.  
It is important for you to make sure your child knows that it is inappropriate to send any personal information to anyone, including K'NEX, unless you have given your explicit approval.

ADVERTISING ON-LINE

In regard to "advertising" on our site, we do have informational catalog-style presentations. This is done to give you and your child a meaningful way to evaluate the various sets, their contents, and possible interest to your child.

SECURE ONLINE PURCHASING FROM K'NEX

Only those 18 or older can make an online purchase from K'NEX. The online form requires the purchaser's real name, billing and shipping addresses, phone number, e-mail address and credit card information in order to complete the order. We accept only valid MASTERCARD or VISA credit cards in the name of the purchaser. We, of course, submit this information to the credit card company, which will use its own methods of verifying addresses and identities. This information will be used only to process and ship the order and will not be retained online after the order has been submitted. It will be kept in a secure off-line database.

K'NEX's SECURE SERVER connection will safely protect Credit Card information via the VeriSign™ system which you have probably used with other online purchases. This information will be deleted from your browser after you complete your order. Completion of your order can be done by one of the following: A) Complete the Credit Card Processing page, B) Closing your Web Browser.

K'NEX requires that online ordering be done by an adult 18 years or older. Any customer wishing to submit an order who is younger than 18 years of age must have the order submitted by a parent or guardian. These orders will become the responsibility of the parent(s) or guardian(s) that own the valid credit card used in the transaction. If you have any questions regarding a purchase, please contact our Consumer Service Center at 1-800- KID - KNEX (1-800-543-5639), Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EST (US and Canadian callers only).

OPTIONAL ORDERING METHOD

If you feel uncomfortable submitting your credit card information over the Internet, you may choose the items you would like to purchase online and then select the "MAIL-IN ORDER FORM" option to print-out your order. Once you have printed your completed order form, send it in with one of the following payment options: A) Credit Card information (MasterCard or VISA only) with Expiration date, or B) Attach a Personal Check or Money Order made out to "K'NEX Industries" for the amount noted on the completed form. We are sorry, but we cannot accept Credit Card orders over the phone.

Please contact our Consumer Service Center regarding any questions and/or inquiries regarding the ordering of K'NEX Parts online and/or through the mail at 1-800-KID-KNEX (1-800-543-5639), Monday through Friday, 8:30am to 5:00pm EST (US and Canadian callers only)

SUBMITTING AN IDEA OR PICTURE TO K'NEX

K'NEX doesn't accept models or ideas except for possible posting to the Photo Gallery section of our web site. We can't accept ideas for any other purpose. The problem we have, along with most other companies, is that there could be confusion if we have independently developed an idea that you think is based upon what you have submitted. We wouldn't want to appear to be using an idea you have sent in, if we had not agreed with you in advance that we wanted it. For example, if you had sent an idea for a crane, and we had been developing one for months, or even years, you might incorrectly think we had taken your idea! We, as a company, cannot allow ourselves to be put in that position, as we are sure you can understand.

So unless you intend to share your idea or model with us as a gift, please do not send pictures, models, or any other creative material to us! Material submitted will be considered as non-confidential and nonproprietary, giving us the right to use it any way we wish. This may include making and selling products based upon such material, licensing the material to others or posting your ideas/photos on our web site  
(By the way, you will see language similar to the above in the "legal" part of most web sites!)

1) Discuss this with your parents. They will need to fully read, understand what we've said above, and complete and sign a Permission Form.

2) If you still want to send us pictures, etc., click here for the Permission Form.

3) Send the Permission Form, fully completed and signed by a parent or guardian, and the picture, to:

K'NEX Consumer Services  
P.O. Box 700
