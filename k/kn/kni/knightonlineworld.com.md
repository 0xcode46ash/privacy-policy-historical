From time to time, this list may change.  All new sites, game services, and related forums will be governed by the terms of this policy. 

**What information do we collect and who is collecting it?**

When you join a K2 Network website, game service or related forum, you are asked to provide some personal information to become a member of a K2 Network website. This type of information can include your name, home or other address, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers. We may also collect other personal information from you in the event that you contribute information, data, text, software, artwork, character art, images, music, sounds, photographs, graphics, video, messages, or other materials (collectively, the "Content") to the K2 Network website. We also collect information about each member's use of K2 Network's features and any survey responses or other information regarding our users' interests and preferences. **K2 Network will not distribute, sell or rent any of the personal information that you provide to us without providing to you prior notice of our intention to do so and a clear opportunity for you to prevent any such disclosure**. Wherever possible, there will be a link to this privacy policy on every website page where personal information might be displayed, collected, or stored. You should also be aware that some websites that link to our site may also collect personal information about you (see "Cookies" section below). We cannot make any representations regarding the information privacy practices of those websites. 

**What about cookies?**

Cookies are used to store and track various types of information about K2 Network users. A cookie is a small piece of data that our web service sends to your browser and that is stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies help us gather useful information such as estimates about the size of our audience, what features of our website are visited most etc. K2 Network never shares or provides any personal identifiable information based upon the use of cookies to any other party. 

**How do we use the information we collect?**

We may use the e-mail address that you provide to us to send notices to you about new features, products, or other information that might interest you. You can choose to opt out of receiving these types of messages when you sign-on as a member, or at any later time. We may also use geographic or other personal information to create better products to serve your interests.  Though K2 Network shall make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding in any applicable jurisdiction, a court order or legal process served on any of the K2 Network sites.

**Is the information secure?**

You are asked to choose a member ID and password when you join our website. Your password is known only to you unless you disclose it to others. We highly recommend that you do not disclose your password to any third party. Also, if there are others who use your computer, you should always sign-out/log out of the K2 Network site and close your browser when you are done using the Internet. K2 Network, uses the security hardware, software and operating procedures, designed to protect the privacy of your personal information stored in the K2 Network computer systems. However, no data that is transmitted over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure in transmission nor safe from theft or illegal acquisition even from K2 Network computers. 

**How do I edit my personal information?**

Your personal information is located in your personal K2 Network profile. Your profile can be edited at any time once you have signed in with your ID and password. Simply click on the "[My Account](https://web.archive.org/web/20070630180233id_/http%3A//knightonlineworld.com/myaccount.php)" link and make your desired changes. 

**Do you share information with co-publishers of game developers?**

Certain K2 Network games may be provided to you in conjunction with a third party publisher or developer. A third party's use of the shared personal information will be governed by this Privacy Policy and K2 Network's use of such information shall, of course, be governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy. K2 will not share any personally identifiable information with any co-publisher or developer that does not agree to abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy.  **Again, K2 Network will not share any such information with any co-publisher or developer without providing to you prior notice of our intention to do so and a clear opportunity for you to prevent any such disclosure.**

**Our Commitment to Children's Privacy.**

We at K2 Network take the online safety of children very seriously. The K2 Network website is designed and maintained for an audience 18 years old and above. For this reason, our member registration asks each applicant to provide his or her date of birth to insure compliance with our minimum age policy. 

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under 13 years of age. Although the K2 Network website is not directed at children under 13 years of age, we recognize that with proper adult supervision some parents might permit their children to visit and utilize the site. COPPA requires that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years of age to use certain features of the K2 Network website. 

When your child attempts to register and/or provide personal information to K2 Network (including on the K2 Network website), we require a parent or legal guardian to: 

  * complete the registration;
  * review our privacy policy and to submit a valid credit card number to verify that the child's parent or guardian knows about and authorizes our information practices related to children protected by COPPA.



Once parental notice and consent have been verified, the information we collect will be treated the same way as information collected from any other user of the K2 Network website. Without verified parental notice and consent, we will not knowingly collect personal information of children under 13 years of age, and if we learn that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will promptly delete it.

In compliance with COPPA, parents and legal guardians may request us to review, delete or stop the collection of their child’s personally identifiable information. You may do so online by visiting “My Account”, by contacting us via e-mail at [privacy@k2network.net](mailto:privacy@k2network.net) or by sending a written communication to:

K2 Network, Inc.  
14252 Culver Dr. #A355  
Irvine, 92604  
Attention: COPPA Administrator 

If you request that no further information about your child be collected or used, we will be required to terminate your child's ability to use the K2 Network webpages that require a user to "sign in." 

**Our Commitment to Data Security.**

During sessions in which you give us information such as credit card numbers, we encrypt your transmissions using SSL ("Secure Sockets Layer") technology. We keep any personally identifiable information you provide us on servers that are protected by firewalls and other technological means against intrusion or unauthorized access. They are located in a physically secure facility, and only our employees and agents with a need to know the information are given access. While no amount of security can give a perfect guarantee, you can have a high degree of confidence that the personally identifiable information you give us is protected from unauthorized access and use. We rely on you to select passwords that cannot be easily guessed and to safeguard those passwords from disclosure.

**Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions.**

We will notify our members, by e-mail or by posting a notice on our website, when we make any significant changes to our Privacy Policy that affect the use of any personally identifiable information we collect. Your continued use of our website will constitute acceptance of the changes and the existing privacy policy. In instances where we ask for your personally identifiable information and we tell you the data we are collecting on that page will be shared with unaffiliated third parties, and in cases where a member of the K2 Network community opts-in to share his/her information with third parties, those disclosures and opt-ins will override anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy. In addition, K2 Network reserves the right to make minor changes to our Privacy Policy at any time without any notice to you other than posting any such changes in a revised Privacy Policy on the K2 Network website. We encourage you to periodically review our Privacy Policy to be sure you are familiar with the most current version. The Policy will include the most recent date in which any revision has been made. Please note that this Privacy Policy is also incorporated, by reference, into K2 Network's Terms of Use. 

**Privacy of Information for the Merchant Center and Affiliate Center.**

K2 Network is committed to the privacy of information collected by these programs as much as it is committed to the privacy of information related to game customers. The policies in this document apply to both the Merchant Center and Affiliate Center. We may request additional information to confirm the identity of you, your banking institution, or your business. To further protect you, we may also have additional confirmatory requirements for changing your information stored at the Merchant Center and Affiliate Center.
