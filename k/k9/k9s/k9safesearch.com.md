# Privacy Policy | K9 Web Protection - Free Internet Filter and Parental Control Software

**LAST UPDATED: 1.30.04**

Blue Coat Systems, Inc. (“Blue Coat”) knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting Blue Coat's Web site, or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. 

## WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER? 

This Privacy Policy covers Blue Coat’s treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Blue Coat gathers when you are accessing Blue Coat's Web site and when you use Blue Coat services. This policy does not apply to the practices of Blue Coat that Blue Coat does not own or control, or to individuals that Blue Coat does not employ or manage. 

## WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES BLUE COAT COLLECT? 

The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our customers. 

**Personal Information You Provide to Us**

We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected includes: company name, company contact name and title, company address, company contact email address, company telephone and facsimile number, company website URL, service contract number, service level, product model number, product part number, product serial number, MAC address, software license key number, purchase order number or sales order number, total Web users at main location, company current proxy solutions, and special dietary requirements for training program meals Blue Coat has highlighted the fields within the forms located throughout the Web site that are minimally required for you to complete in order for Blue Coat to provide you with the most complete service. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain products and services, identifying you, and communicating with you about specials and new products. Personal Information you provide us may also include other information when needed to provide a service you requested. For example, if you choose to make a purchase in the Online Store area of the Web site, we will request personal information such as: name, address, telephone number, credit card number and shipping information. When you buy a new product, we may ask you to register your purchase electronically. When you do, we keep this registration information on file with any information you’ve already given us on previous visits to our Web site. This is considered your personal profile. 

**Personal Information Collected Automatically**

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Web site or services. Blue Coat automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Blue Coat cookie information, and the page you requested. • Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Blue Coat only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Web site or services so that we can make the Web site appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. 1 • Many companies offer programs that help you to visit Web sites anonymously. While Blue Coat will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available. 

**E-mail Communications**

We may send email communications to you to inform you about specials, product updates, new products, or provide you with field alerts notices and newsletters. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, you may i) access “Subscriber Preferences” currently located at <https://services.bluecoat.com/eservice_enu/start.swe> and click the “Suppress” option for any method of Blue Coat’s product or service-related communications you wish to suppress; or ii) click the “Unsubscribe” option located at the end of any newsletter received by you from Blue Coat or select the option marked “I do not require further information at this time” currently located at <http://www.bluecoat.com/downloads/whitepapers/internet_policy.html> for news-related announcements you wish to discontinue, or iii) simply contact Blue Coat and we will update our records accordingly. 

**Personal Information From Other Sources**

For purposes such as improving personalization of our service, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. We also sometimes receive updated delivery and address information from our shippers or other sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily. 

**What About Cookies?**

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. Blue Coat cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is. • Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Web site’s most attractive features. 

**K9 Web Protection**

Blue Coat collects personal information from you when you request or register a license to use K9 Web Protection Software (“K9 Software”). As part of the registration process, you are required to provide certain personal information which may include, if applicable: name, address, email address, company name, company contact name and title, company telephone and fax number, and payment details. Blue Coat will primarily use this information to provide the licensee access to service and product functionality (such as using licensee’s email address to send passwords required to access and use the product). Blue Coat may also occasionally use this information to send you other communications, important product information and updates. In order to function, the K9 Software sends the following information from licensee’s computer to Blue Coat’s Web rating service: (i) information identifying licensee’s software license, (ii) information that relates licensee’s software license to licensee’s authorized computer, and (iii) the URLs of the web sites licensee needs rated. The Web rating service logs the number of web site rating requests made under licensee’s software license in order to monitor and track fraudulent use of the Blue Coat rating service. However, Blue Coat’s Web rating service does not track which web sites a licensee requests to have rated under his or her software license, and does not develop any history of a licensee’s web browsing activities.

**K9 Safe Search**

No personally identifiable information is ever required by K9 Safe Search, meaning the search engine never seeks any information related to your name, telephone number, address or email address. We do collect limited non-personally identifying information that your browser makes available. This log information includes your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, referral data and the date and time of your query.
