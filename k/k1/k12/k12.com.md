# K12: Privacy Policy

At K12, your privacy as an individual is very important to us. Accordingly, we will not sell any personally identifiable information you supply us. 

Please review the full policy below for more details. If you have questions or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy, e-mail [privacy@k12.com](mailto:privacy@k12.com). 

Collection of Information

  * When you register, we ask for your name, e-mail address, and other profile information, such as credit card and billing information. We may also request additional profile information for optional online surveys and identification verification. 
  * In the course of using our site, we log certain information including your IP address, the browser you are using, and the previous URL you were visiting. 
  * We personalize your user experience by delivering content specific to your interests and activity on K12 based on your browsing and message activity. 
  * If you send us correspondence, such as e-mails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities on the site, we may store such information so that we can serve you better. 

Use of Your Information

  * We use profile information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, review site usage, and improve our site's content, offerings, and layout. 
  * We may use profile information for market research purposes and to generate aggregate reports on student interests and behavior. We will not identify any individuals. 
  * With your prior approval, we may use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about new offerings from K12 and special offers we think you will find useful. If you would rather not receive such notices, please contact us at [privacy@k12.com](mailto:privacy@k12.com). 
  * We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. 
  * We use your e-mail address, and in some situations your mailing address, phone or fax number, to contact you when necessary. (An agent of K12 may contact you to ensure you are satisfied with the service.) 
  * In the absence of a special relationship, we do not pass on your profile information to any third party without your express permission, but we may distribute aggregate information to other parties for marketing and promotional purposes. You cannot be personally identified from this aggregate information. Certain information, such as your password or credit card number, is not disclosed. 
  * We may occasionally partner with another company. By this we mean that a portion or version of our website is integrated into our partner's site or is integrated with our partner's content or branding. We may agree to share your information with them. However, if we share such information, we do so only under strict confidentiality. 
  * We may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe it is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interfering with (either intentionally or unintentionally) K12's rights or property, other K12 users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. 
  * We may set and access cookies on your computer. We use cookies for a number of purposes, including but not limited to: providing customized content, keeping track of you preferences, estimating and reporting total K12 site audience size and traffic, and conducting research to improve K12 content and services. 

Notification of Changes

  * If at some point there is a change to our information usage practices that affect your personally identifiable information, we will notify you by e-mail of the relevant changes. At the time of that message, you will be able to opt-out of this information usage by sending an e-mail message to [privacy@k12.com](mailto:privacy@k12.com). You should also check this posted privacy statement for changes. 

Control of Passwords

  * You are required to control your password as described in the K12 User Agreement. 
  * If you have forgotten your password, please contact us at [privacy@k12.com](mailto:privacy@k12.com). Your password will be e-mailed to you shortly thereafter. 
  * K12 will never ask for your password in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail. 

Security

  * Transmission of information over the Internet cannot be guaranteed 100% secure, but some sites take greater precautions than others to protect the privacy and security of their users. While the Internet is not a locked-down environment, K12 places a high premium on security and privacy. 
  * We use Secure Socket Layers (SSL) to encrypt sensitive payment data you send to us. Access to our site is password protected. A high-strength firewall protects our database from outsiders. Credit card information is stored separately from other user information. This data is stored in an encrypted and secure format using the same technologies that most banks and financial institutions use. If you are uncomfortable in providing your credit card information online, we will be happy to take such information over the telephone. The physical devices running K12 reside in one of the country's most respected hosting location facilities.

Children's Privacy Policy

  * K12 ordinarily accepts service agreements established by persons over the age of 18. When someone under the age of 13 attempts to register with K12, we ask that he or she have a parent or guardian establish a service agreement in order to obtain parental consent.

  * K12 uses this information to create and maintain accounts, for research, and may use this information to customize the advertising and content seen on our pages. 
  * Under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, no website operator can require, as a condition of participation in an activity, that a child under the age of 13 disclose more information than is reasonably necessary. K12 abides by this requirement. 

Information Sharing and Disclosure

  * K12 will not rent or sell children's personally identifiable information to anyone. 
  * K12 will not contact children under the age of 13 about special offers or for marketing purposes without parental consent. K12 will send personally identifiable information about a child to other companies or people when:

    * We need to send the information to companies that work on behalf of K12 to provide a product or service that has been requested. Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us; or 
    * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, to the extent permitted by law. 

Ability to Update or Delete Information

  * If a parent chooses not to allow us to further collect or use the child's information, that parent can send an e-mail to [privacy@k12.com](mailto:privacy@k12.com) to request deletion of their child's account. 
  * Please note that information about a child may remain in back-up storage for some period of time after a request for deletion of that child's account. This may be the case even though no information about that account remains in our active user databases.
