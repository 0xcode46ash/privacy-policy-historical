You can always choose not to provide information, but you may not be able to use a particular service or feature.

### Our use of your information

We use the information we collect from you to improve our products and services and make your shopping experience more efficient and relevant. We review the actions of our visitors on an aggregate basis to determine customers' preferences. KEH also conducts analysis and research on our visitors' demographics, interests, and pages viewed based on the information provided to us during ordering, from our server log files, contests or surveys. 

###### Contests and Sweepstakes

When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask you for contact information such as your name, address and e-mail address in order to administer the contest, to send you promotional e-mails, notify winners and make the winners' list publicly available pursuant to certain states' laws. Your consent to such promotional use and disclosure of this information is a condition of your participation. As a condition of receiving any prize, you will be required to complete, execute and return an Affidavit of Eligibility, a Liability Release, and where lawful, a Publicity Release, for us to ensure that you are eligible to receive the prize according to the Contest Rules. In cases where the sweepstakes or promotional offer is co-branded with or sponsored by another party, we may share your information, with your consent, to that party. 

###### E-mails

It is possible to register a KEH email subscriber directly from our site or through another source, such as a sweepstakes, etc. hosted on another site or the co-registration network™. Upon registering, we will periodically send you newsletters and e-mails featuring exclusive sales, promotions and other members-only benefits. If you make a purchase on our site we will send you and order and shipping confirmation emails. If you are a subscribed member, we will also send you emails to collect ratings and testimonials feedback related to your purchase. If you'd rather not receive emails, please email [webmaster@keh.com](mailto:webmaster@keh.com) to change your preferences. 

###### Gift Certificates

If you purchase a gift certificate on our site, we will ask you to provide the recipient's name and e-mail address. The recipient information you provide us will only be used to deliver the gift certificate and for no other purpose. 

### Does KEH share the information it receives?

The following describes some of the ways that your personally identifiable information may be disclosed: 

###### Fulfillment

During the purchase process, we will share your information with certain intermediaries (e.g. UPS, FedX, Credit Card Processors, Product Manufacturers, etc.) strictly to process and ship your order. 

###### Agents

We employ other third parties to perform services or functions on our behalf in order to improve our site, merchandising, marketing and promotional efforts, communications or other services. Those third parties include authorized contractors, consultants and other companies working with us (collectively, "agents"). They only have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, and may not share any personal information with others or use it for any other purpose than improving KEHs’ services and offerings. 

###### Advertisers

We work with third party advertising companies, such as Google, Yahoo, Miva, etc. to serve and track our ads. These third parties may serve other cookies. 

###### Third Party Sites

You may visit other web sites, through links on our site, who may collect, use and share your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. The information practices of those websites linking from or to our site are not covered by this Policy, and we encourage you to be very cautious before you disclose your personal information to others. It is possible that KEH could merge with or be acquired by another business entity. Should such an event occur, you should expect that KEH would share some or all of your information in order to continue to provide such products and services.

###### Legal Requests

KEH will cooperate with law enforcement inquiries. KEH reserves the right to disclose any activities or information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, determine necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or you to legal liability.

### Accessing and Updating Your Information

You always have the opportunity to review and change the information you provide to us by logging into the site and entering in the new information yourself. You can edit your name, contact information and preferences by logging into the My Account section of the site. 

As a customer, subscriber, or contest entrant, you will occasionally receive e-mail communications about new KEH products, special offers we think you'll like and requests for feedback. If you want to stop receiving our emails or to specify the communications you prefer to receive, you may unsubscribe or edit your profile at any time. You can do this through any of our emails, by visiting your account preferences page or sending us an email at [webmaster@keh.com](mailto:webmaster@keh.com). 

You may ask to have your account information removed from our active databases; however, because we keep track of past purchases, you cannot delete information associated with past purchases. Such information will be deactivated as soon as reasonably possible based on your account activity. Also, as a security measure we "back up" the data stored on our systems, and such prior information cannot be completely removed from our databases. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personally identifiable information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests. 

### Security

The KEH Security Pledge protects you while you shop at KEH so that you never have to worry about credit card safety. We guarantee that every transaction you make at KEH will be safe. This means you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your credit card as a result of shopping at KEH. KEH’s' servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an encryption technology that works with Netscape, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and AOL's browser, so that only KEH can read a buyer's personal information. We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. However, we will transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. 

### A special note about children's privacy

You must be at least 18 years old to have our permission to use this site. We do not knowingly collect, use or disclose Personally Identifiable Information about visitors under 18 years of age. If you are a minor, you can use this service only in conjunction with your parents or guardians.
