We at Keurig take your privacy concerns very seriously.

##### What We Collect

When you purchase a product from Keurig.com, we ask you to provide information to fulfill your order. The only personal information we store is information that you give us voluntarily. Some information, such as name and address information, is required in order for us to deliver your order. Signing up for e-mails or registering a brewer also requires you to supply certain information, such as name and e-mail address, so we may execute your request.

##### What We Do With What We Collect

From time to time, Keurig contacts customers by email, phone or mail to inform them of new products, services and special offers, or to follow up on previous interactions. Additionally, because Green Mountain Coffee Roasters is Keurig’s parent company, we also give you the opportunity to receive information from them.

When you set up an account, you are given the opportunity to receive communications from us and/or Green Mountain Coffee Roasters. You may choose to opt-out of these communications during the set up process or after set up at any time by logging in to “My Account” and visiting “Edit My Communication Preferences” or by calling customer service at 1-866-901-BREW (2739). (You may also opt out of Keurig communication by simply using the “Unsubscribe” link located in the footer of our e-mails). Please note: changes can take up to two weeks to take effect.

Maintaining the confidentiality of your personal information—including credit card data—is very important to Keurig. As a Keurig customer, your personal information will never be rented or sold. For your security, **we only store your credit card information if you choose to set up an automatic delivery**. In that case, it is stored on a secure computer in a format that makes it unusable except by us, for your order. If you do not set up an automatic delivery, you will have to enter your credit card information each time you order. We understand that this may be a little inconvenient for you, but some customers appreciate the added peace of mind this brings.

##### Cookies

Like most commercial websites, [www.keurig.com](http://www.keurig.com/) uses cookies to improve the shopping experience. A cookie is a small text file that is transferred from our server to your computer's hard drive through your web browser that enables our system to recognize your browser. Cookies help us understand if you are a new or returning visitor. This information lets us know how we are doing at both attracting new visitors and maintaining relationships with our existing customers. 

##### Secure Online Ordering

Keurig is committed to ensuring that your shopping experience on [www.keurig.com](http://www.keurig.com/) is safe and secure.

When you do place an order, your address and credit card information is transmitted using industry standard encryption technology called secure socket layers (SSL) which ensures that it is encrypted during transmission. The integrity of our safe shopping technology is verified by Verisign, the premier secure transaction accreditation authority. You will see the Verisign insignia on our checkout pages to confirm that you are in 'secure mode.' Additional security assurances are given by the locked padlock icon or solid key icon at the bottom of your browser window, and the letters "https" (rather than "http") located in the URL address window at the top of your browser.

If you prefer, you may place your order by calling 1-866-901-BREW (2739) and a customer service representative will be happy to help you.

##### Privacy Policy Changes

Our business is evolving and with it our Privacy Policy may change. For customers who have agreed to accept Keurig e-mails, it is our policy to e-mail notices of our privacy policy changes. We invite all visitors to check this policy on [www.keurig.com](http://www.keurig.com/) from time to time. We will post all changes to this Privacy Policy on our website.
