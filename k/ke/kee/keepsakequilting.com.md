**Keepsake Quilting's Privacy and Security  
**  


Keepsake Quilting is committed to safeguarding and respecting your privacy. We maintain our own secure servers and mail operations on our own premises, and handle all your information with the utmost care. If you have any questions or concerns about how we handle your information, please ask us (see contact information listed below). 

**Information we collect**

Just as we record your information (name, address, phone, credit card, etc.) when you place an order with us by mail or over the telephone, we receive and store that same information when you enter it on our Web site. We need that information to process your order, streamline future orders and communicate with you if necessary. In addition to this information, additional data is stored automatically when you shop online with us, such as the Web browser and operating system you use, and the specific IP address used to connect to our Web site.   
Please note: Credit card numbers and customer information DOES NOT reside on our Web Server, but is transmitted securely using 128 bit encryption to/from our OFFLINE fulfillment system. 

**How we handle e-mail**

When you provide us your e-mail address (either by entering it on our site or communicating with us via e-mail), we may send you e-mails necessary to process your order, respond to a request, provide customer service, or promote products or services. However, we only want to send promotional materials to those who wish to receive them. Any promotional e-mail sent to you will contain the opportunity to unsubscribe to the service. Your e-mail address will never be shared with any other company. If you prefer, you may contact us directly (see our contact information below). 

**How we handle postal addresses**

If you supply us with your postal address, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please let us know by contacting us directly (see our contact information below). We occasionally share our customer postal mailing list with other fine companies whose products we think you might enjoy. If you'd prefer not to have your name shared, let us know by e-mailing, calling or writing to us at the address listed below. We will then immediately place you on our do-not-share list. 

**How we handle phone numbers**

If you supply us with your telephone number online, you may receive telephone contact from us with information regarding orders you have placed online. If you chose to communicate with us in this way, please provide us with your correct phone number. (Your phone number will never be shared with any outside organization). 

**Contacting us**

We invite you to contact us at anytime for any reason, and we will get back to you as soon as we possibly can:
