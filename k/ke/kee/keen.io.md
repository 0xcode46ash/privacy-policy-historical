# Keen IO - The API for Custom Analytics

Privacy matters, so we try to keep it simple. The true, legal privacy policy is below, but in an effort to push plain-language communication, we wanted to include an abstract. Like most websites and web services, we directly and indirectly collect some information about you. We do so in order to communicate with you and to try to make our service the best it can be. We respect your privacy and only share your information when the business requires it (e.g. payment processing). Your personal information is not a monetization channel for us. We may aggregate lots of user information and use it to learn and share what we’ve learned about analytics, but all personally identifiable information will be stripped from that dataset. Cool? Again, this is just an abstract. The nitty gritty is listed below. If you think our abstract is inconsistent with our policy, let us know. We really want to be on the up and up. 

This Privacy Policy explains how our practices regarding the information we collect through our website and related services (collectively, the “Service”). By submitting information through our website or services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your information according to this Privacy Policy. Your Information may be processed by us in the country where it was collected as well as other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.
