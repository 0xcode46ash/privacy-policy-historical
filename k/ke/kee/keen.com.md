# Welcome to Keen.com

Keen.com, Inc. takes privacy issues very seriously and we have made a firm commitment to protect your privacy. The following outlines Keen.com's policies for information gathering and dissemination.

**TRUSTe Licensee**  
[](https://www.truste.org/validate/5518)This confirms that Keen.com is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because Keen.com wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, this web site has agreed to notify you of: 

  1. What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identification is collected from you through the web site 
  2. The organization collecting the information
  3. How the information is used
  4. With whom the information may be shared
  5. What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information
  6. The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Keen.com's control
  7. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. 



If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact Keen.com, Inc. by sending email to [privacy@keen.com](mailto:privacy@keen.com). If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe <http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns.

**Information Keen.com Collects**  
Registration is not required in order to browse the Keen.com web site, [www.keen.com](http://www.keen.com/) ("the Site"), but it is required to connect with other members of the Keen.com community via telephone or Keen Mail. When members join Keen.com we collect contact information including full name, email address and telephone number. We use members' email addresses to contact them regarding administrative notices, new site features, and communications relevant to their use of the Site. Members can stop receiving site updates and promotional mailings from Keen.com by sending their member name and email address to [mailopt-out@keen.com](mailto:mailopt-out@keen.com) or by unchecking the box on the Personal Info page which asks whether they wish to receive such mailings. 

If members choose to include their personal information in the Keen.com search feature, we use their names and email addresses to help others search for listings that those members have created. For example, if a person knows that a friend is a member of Keen.com, but doesn't know the friend's member name, that person can search for any listings that the friend has created by typing in the friend's first name, last name, or email address in the search field. Keen.com will never disclose member names or email addresses during the search process, and members can remove themselves from the search feature by clicking on the Personal Info tab at the My Account page.

We collect additional information such as a mailing address and social security numbers and/or Federal Tax ID numbers from members who charge price per minute fees above the standard rate to communicate with them through the Keen.com web site. Members who are not United States taxpayers, will not be asked for their social security numbers or Federal Tax ID numbers, though they may need to report income to their local tax authority. We use members' mailing addresses to remit payments according to our payment policy set out in our Member Agreement. We use members' social security numbers and/or Federal Tax ID numbers to prepare Form 1099s for members who earn more than $600 in a calendar year. Keen.com will not use this information for any purpose other than to prepare Form 1099s and will never share this information with third parties.

Keen.com requires members to select a unique member name and password during the member sign-up process. Member names are used throughout the site to identify members to other Keen.com users. Therefore, members should be aware that if they use their real name as their member name, this information will be visible to others on the site, who will then be able to personally identify their activities on the site.

Keen.com collects credit card information from members when they add money to their Keen.com accounts. We use credit card information to bill members for telephone calls that they initiate. Keen.com uses a third party to process credit cards for billing purposes. This third party does not store or retain any of a member's personally identifiable information. We also use credit card information to verify age in order to provide members access to certain areas of the site. Members will not be allowed access to these areas unless they provide a valid credit card number. The age verification process will NOT result in a charge to a member's credit card or in the credit card being used for billing purposes.

Members may also provide additional profile information (such as experience, credentials, affiliations, on-call schedule, etc.) that is displayed publicly on the Site. Other than the profile information submitted by members, Keen.com does not disclose any personally identifying information without members' permission.

Keen.com collects information from potential affiliates including the company's name, address and URL, and the names, addresses, e-mail addresses and telephone numbers of the company's primary contacts. We use this information to contact affiliates regarding administrative notices, new site features, and communications relevant to their use of the Site. Keen.com also collects affiliates' social security numbers and/or Federal Tax ID numbers. This information is required so that Keen.com may prepare Form 1099s for those affiliates who earn money through the Keen.com affiliate program. Keen.com does not disclose any personally identifying information, without an affiliate's permission.

**Member-to-Member Communications**  
**Telephone Communications**  
Because our business connects members by telephone, Keen.com requires valid telephone numbers from all of its members. We use telephone numbers to connect members through the Site. **At no time will Keen.com share members' telephone numbers with anyone, including those members with whom they communicate through the Keen.com Site.** Because Keen.com initiates all telephone calls made through the Site, neither party can see the other's telephone number - not even with Caller ID. Although the Keen.com system maintains the connection between the two parties, telephone calls between members are not monitored.

**Keen Mail**  
Keen.com also facilitates communication among members through our on-site Keen Mail system. Messages sent via Keen Mail are identified only by member name, and do not reveal either member's e-mail address.

**Feedback Ratings**  
Members are given the opportunity to rate and provide feedback regarding fellow members, both in numerical and textual form. These feedback ratings are viewable on the Site. All numerical feedback will contribute to a member's overall rating. Textual comments will be attributed to the rating member's member name. Once posted members cannot change or remove any ratings or textual messages.

**Other Information**  
**Aggregate Information** Keen.com may use certain information collected from members in aggregate form to tailor our members' experience at the Site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. We may also use this information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts.

**IP Addresses** Keen.com uses User IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Site. Generally, IP addresses tell us the location from which a User is connecting to us, what service provider the User is using, and which parts of the Site the User is visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a User's session will be tracked, but the User will remain anonymous.

**Correspondence** If a member sends Keen.com e-mail correspondence, or if other members or other third parties send us e-mail or other correspondence regarding a particular member's activities or postings on the Site, Keen.com may collect such information in that member's account file.

**Keen.com Affiliates** Keen.com may disclose aggregate data and statistics in order to describe the Site and services to prospective partners, cobranded sites, advertisers and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. **We do not sell, rent, or trade any personally identifiable information to third parties, and we do not use members' mailing address information for unsolicited marketing.** The only exceptions are when we either have a member's permission or believe in good faith that the law requires it. Keen.com may disclose some personally identifiable information to third party service providers in connection with communications and payments to users and other aspects of operation of the site. Such third parties will be under extensive confidentiality restrictions. 

**Promotions** Keen.com may from time to time run online promotions in which we ask visitors for demographic information (like their zip code, state/province or age). Keen.com may also run contests on the Site in which we ask visitors for demographic information. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at the Site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. We also use demographic information to determine eligibility for certain contests.

**Surveys** From time to time Keen.com may ask members to participate in online surveys. Such surveys may ask visitors for contact information (like their email address). We use contact data from our surveys to send the user information about our company. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.

**Tell A Friend Program** Keen.com's Tell A Friend Program allows members to earn money by referring their friends to our Site. The contact information entered as part of Keen.com's Tell A Friend program will be used only to personalize referral e-mail sent to the member's friends. The information entered about various friends will be used to send a one-time referral e-mail to the friends.

**Verification Program** In order to enhance their listings, members may [verify](https://www.keen.com/web/credentials_redirect.asp) their professional and academic credentials through Backgrounds Online, a leading provider of comprehensive background checks on individuals. Members may submit information to be verified by [Backgrounds Online](http://www.backgroundsonline.com/) (such as academic degrees and professional licenses) on the Keen.com web site. All information submitted as part of the verification program is subject to the [agreement](https://www.keen.com/web/credentials_redirect.asp) between the member and Backgrounds Online, which may contain terms that differ from Keen.com's privacy policy.

**Links to Other Sites**  
The Site may contain links to other sites. Keen.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. We encourage members to review the policies of these sites before revealing any sensitive or personal information in the course of using these other sites.

**Keen.com's Use of Cookies**  
The Site uses cookies. Cookies are small amounts of data sent to a user's browser from the Keen.com Web servers and stored on a user's computer's hard drive. Keen.com uses cookies to track the pages on the Site that our users have visited. This allows us to collect aggregate information about usage on the Site. Keen.com may also use cookies to deliver content specific to members' interests, and to keep track of members' member names and passwords so that members do not have to reenter them during a session. Users who choose not to accept cookies are unable to use the Keen.com web site.

**Reviewing and Changing Personally Identifiable Information**  
Once members join Keen.com they can review and change much of their personally identifiable information - including name, e-mail address, telephone number, password and password reminder -- by clicking on the Personal Info tab at the My Account page on the Keen.com Site. Members may review, update or change their address and credit card information -- if they have supplied it -- by clicking on the Credit Card Information link at the My Account page. Members also may correct, update or delete any of their Keen.com listings by clicking on the Check tab at the My Listings page. 

**Members may cancel their Keen.com accounts by:**

  1. Sending e-mail - including your member name and e-mail address - to opt-out@keen.com (if you can't remember your member name, send us the first and last name you provided when you joined)  


  2. Sending mail to the following address: 

Keen.com Opt-Out  
P.O. Box 418  
San Francisco, CA 94104-0418




We will retain in our files information members have requested to remove in some circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Member Agreement. Moreover, such information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical constraints and the fact we back up our systems. Therefore, members' personally identifiable information may not be completely removed from our databases in response to member requests.

**Security**  
Keen.com uses industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of members' personally identifiable information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers. We also use generally accepted industry standards to determine the hardware and software requirements for providing security.
