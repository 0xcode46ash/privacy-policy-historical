# Keen.com: Privacy Policy

Your privacy is very important to us at Keen.com, and Keen.com is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. What is TRUSTe? TRUSTe is a non-profit organization dedicated to building trust in the Internet. We disclose information practices to TRUSTe, who in turn operates as a third-party "watch dog" by auditing our privacy practices to make sure that we are in compliance with TRUSTe's privacy standards. When you visit a Web site displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, you can expect to be notified of: What personally identifiable information of yours is collected; What organization is collecting the information; How the information is used; With whom the information may be shared; What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information; What kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under the company's control; and How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. 

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact Keen.com, Inc. by sending email to [privacy@keen.com](mailto:privacy@keen.com). If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe <http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with Keen.com to resolve your concerns. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect about you and what may happen to that information. Although this policy may seem long, we have prepared a detailed policy because we believe you should know as much as possible about Keen.com's practices so that you can make an informed decision.

1\. A Special Note About Children  
Children are not eligible to use Keen.com and we ask that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us.

2\. Security  
Keen.com has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL), which digitally encrypts your information, as it is transferred from your computer to Keen.com. We have taken measures to protect user information once it is received by the site, including but not limited to the following: limited and controlled access by employees, servers and data stored in a secured location, security software where appropriate and cost effective. Employees are informed of all security protocol on a regular basis, and web security procedures are quality-assured weekly. 

3\. Information Keen.com Collects  
Our primary goal in collecting personal information from you is to provide you with a smooth and efficient experience while using Keen.com. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience easier and quicker. We don't require you to register in order to browse Keen.com, but you do need to register in order to connect with other members of the Keen.com community via telephone or Keen Mail.

When you join Keen.com using our online registration form, we collect an email address, member name, and password. Your member name is used throughout Keen.com to identify you to other Keen.com Members. Therefore, you should be aware that if you use your real name as your Member name, this information would be visible to others on the site.

Because we connect members by telephone, we require you to enter a valid telephone number to connect with other members through Keen.com. At no time will we share your telephone number with anyone, including those members with whom you communicate through Keen.com. Because Keen.com initiates all telephone calls, no one can see your telephone number - not even with Caller ID. Although the Keen.com system maintains the connection between the two parties, we do not monitor or record the content of telephone calls made through Keen.com. 

We use your email address to contact you regarding administrative notices, new product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of Keen.com. If you do not wish to receive these communications, you have the ability to stop receiving these communications by sending your member name and email address to [unsubscribe@keen](mailto:unsubscribe@keen.com) or by unchecking the box on the Personal Info page which asks whether they wish to receive such mailings. You can also stop receiving the newsletter by replying to the newsletter email with "unsubscribe" as the subject line. You will receive system emails on Keen.com to notify you of system changes and communications relevant to your use of the Site. You may not opt-out of system emails.

If you are earning money on Keen.com, we collect additional information from you so we can process and remit to you your KeenSpeaker fees. We collect your mailing address to remit payments, and we collect your social security number and/or Federal Tax ID number to prepare Form 1099s if necessary. We will never share this information with third parties. Members who are not United States taxpayers will not be asked for their social security numbers or Federal Tax ID numbers, though they may need to report income to their local tax authority.

Keen.com collects credit card information when you add money to your Keen.com account. Keen.com uses a third party to process credit cards for billing purposes. This third party does not store or retain any of a member's personally identifiable information. In certain cases, we will also use credit card information to verify age in order to provide access to certain areas of the site. We do not charge or bill the credit card when we collect credit card information for age verification purposes. 

You can review, update and change your personally identifiable information - including name, e-mail address, telephone number, password and password reminder -- by clicking on the Personal Info tab at the My Account page on the Keen.com Site. You may review, update or change your address and credit card information -- if you have supplied it -- by clicking on the Credit Card Information link at the My Account page. You may correct, update or delete any of your Keen.com listings by clicking on the My Listings tab.

If you choose to include your personal information in the Keen.com search feature, your name and email address will help others find listings you have created. For example, if a person knows that a friend is a member of Keen.com, but doesn't know the friend's member name, that person can search for any listings that the friend has created by typing in the friend's first name, last name, or email address in the search field. We will never disclose member names or email addresses during the search process unless you choose to make this information available, and you can remove themselves from the search feature by clicking on the Personal Info tab at the My Account page.

You may also provide Keen.com additional profile information (such as experience, credentials, affiliations, on-call schedule, etc.) that is displayed publicly on the Site in your homepage or in your listings. Other than the profile information submitted by our members, and except as noted herein, Keen.com does not disclose any personally identifying information without your permission.

Keen.com's Tell A Friend Program allows members to earn money by referring their friends to our Site. The contact information you enter as part of Keen.com's Tell A Friend program will be used only to personalize a one-time referral e-mail sent to your friends.

We use information we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Member Agreement. At times, we may look at your account information and transaction history to identify problems or resolve disputes. Moreover, such information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical constraints and the fact we back up our systems. Therefore, our members' personally identifiable information may not be completely removed from our databases in response to member requests.

Keen.com also facilitates communication among members through our on-site Keen Mail system. Messages sent via Keen Mail are identified only by your member name, and we do not reveal either member's personal e-mail address.

Keen.com may use certain information collected from our members in aggregate form to tailor our members' experience at the Site, showing you content that we think you might be interested in, and displaying the content according to your preferences. We may also use this information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts.

Keen.com uses cookies. Cookies are small amounts of data sent to a user's browser from the Keen.com Web servers and stored on a user's computer's hard drive. Keen.com uses cookies to track the pages on the Site that our users have visited. This allows us to collect aggregate information about usage on the Site.

If you choose not to accept cookies, you will be unable to use the Keen.com web site.

Keen.com uses your IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Site. Generally, IP addresses tell us the location from which a person is connecting to us, what service provider the person is using, and which parts of the Site the User is visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that your session will be tracked, but you will remain anonymous. We reserve the right to track IP addresses for the purposes of fraud prevention, and we reserve the right to release IP addresses to legal authorities.

If you send Keen.com e-mail correspondence, or if other members or other third parties send us e-mail or other correspondence regarding a particular member's activities or postings on the Site, Keen.com may collect such information.

4\. Our Disclosure of Your Information.  
We do not sell, rent, or trade any personally identifiable information to third parties, and we do not use members' mailing address information for unsolicited marketing. The only exceptions are when we either have your permission or we believe in good faith that the law requires it. For example, in some cases, the government can compel the disclosure of information about you, and Keen.com will need to comply if it believes such disclosure to be appropriate, in which case you authorize it to do so. You also consent to Keen.com disclosing information about you to actual or potential parties to a lawsuit that Keen.com is or may become involved in (a) if it required to do so, (b) if it reasonably believes that such disclosures will potentially mitigate its liability, or (c) to enforce its rights. Keen.com may disclose some personally identifiable information to third party service providers in connection with communications and payments to users and other aspects of operation of the site. Such third parties will be under extensive confidentiality restrictions. 

We may from time to time run promotions in which we ask visitors for demographic information (like their zip code, state/province or age). We may also run contests on Keen.com in which we ask visitors for demographic information. We use this data to tailor your experience, showing content that we think you might be interested in, and displaying the content according to your preferences. We also use demographic information to determine eligibility for certain contests.

From time to time Keen.com may ask members to participate in surveys. Such surveys may ask visitors for contact information (like their email address). We use contact data from our surveys to send information about our company. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.

In order to enhance your listings, you may [verify](https://web.archive.org/credentials/credentials_agreement.asp) your professional and academic credentials through Backgrounds Online, a leading provider of comprehensive background checks on individuals. You may submit information to be verified by [Backgrounds Online](http://www.backgroundsonline.com/) (such as academic degrees and professional licenses) on the Keen.com web site. All information submitted as part of the verification program is subject to the [agreement](https://web.archive.org/credentials/credentials_agreement.asp) between the member and Backgrounds Online, which may contain terms that differ from Keen.com's privacy policy.
