We at Keeko believe strongly in confidentiality. Our site requires certain secure and confidential information from you so we can do our job correctly. This information may be something like: Name, Email Address and Facebook Page (or other information that is necessary for the system). 

However, all of this information is held in the strictest form of confidence and is never sold, or given to other service providers or advertisers. The information you provide is used for the sole and express use of completing your service, and is not shared in any way with outside sources or parties.

But personal information will never be disclosed. 

Our company uses the appropriate managerial, electronic, and physical procedures to safeguard all personal information.
