This Privacy Policy does not govern our use of any information you provide to us when you call us, write to us, or communicate with us in any manner other than through the Site. Because the Internet is global, information about you that we collect or that you submit may be transferred to, processed in, and held in countries (including the United States) other than the one in which you reside. **By using the Site, you explicitly consent to such use of your information and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.** This Privacy Policy is effective as of July 1, 2010.

**1.  Information We Automatically Collect.  **We automatically collect certain information to help us understand how our users use the Site (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as " **Usage Data** "). For example, each time you visit the Site we may automatically collect your IP address, browser and computer type, access time, the Web page from which you came, and the Web page(s) that you access during your visit. We also use cookies (which are small amounts of data sent from a web server to your browser that are stored on your computer’s hard drive) to keep track of your use of the Site, to validate your identity, to remember your password and preferences, to tailor the Site to meet your personal interests, and to improve the quality of the Site. In addition, third parties who place advertisements on the Site may also collect information through cookies to ensure that their advertising systems and technologies work properly and to allow them to track responses to their advertisements. Cookies set by these third parties are governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. Generally, you can set your browser not to accept cookies or to notify you if you are sent a cookie, giving you the opportunity to choose whether or not to accept the cookie. Please note that if you do set your browser not to accept cookies, certain areas of our Site may not function properly.

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**. Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. 

**Flash LSOs**. We use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to play training tutorial videos on our site.  In addition, Third Parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information.

Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.  Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.  To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies [click here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118).

**2.  Information You Choose To Submit.**  You can visit the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could personally identify you (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as " **Personal Information** "). If, however, you wish to register to become a member of the Site, you are required to provide certain Personal Information (e.g., your name and e-mail address), and we ask that you also provide a user name and password. We use your Personal Information to fulfill your requests for products and services, to improve our services, and to contact you from time to time about us, our Site, and our products and services, and newsletters. You may also choose to submit additional information about yourself (for example your gender, or zip code) by which someone could not personally identify you (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as " **Non-Personal Information** "). Finally, you may choose to submit documents, photos, calendar entries, or any other information that you would like to share with other users of the Site (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as " **Shared Information** ").  You may at any time decide who is able to review your Shared Information.  You may control the exact sharing of any of your Shared Information by changing the sharing settings for that particular item or its enclosing folder. 

We provide you the ability to import photos from third party sites.  If you choose to import your photos from third party sites we will ask you for your username and password for that site in order to allow you to sign into your account and import your photos.  We do not store this information for any reason. No other information will be imported when we import your photos. 

**3.   Our Information Sharing Practices. **

**(a) _Generally._**  Except as otherwise described in this section of our Privacy Policy, we will never sell, share, rent, or trade your Usage Data, Personal Information, Non-Personal Information, or Shared Information (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as " **User Information** ") with any third party except as disclosed within this privacy policy.

**(b)  ** _ **Advertisers.**_  From time to time, we may share your Usage Data and Non-Personal Information to enable third parties who serve advertisements on the Site to deliver advertisements that will be relevant to you. We will not share any such information, however, in a manner that would enable the advertiser to personally identify you.

**(c)  ** _ **Aggregated Data.**_  From time to time, we may share aggregated User Information (other than Shared Information) with third parties. We will not share any aggregated data, however, in manner that would enable the recipient to personally identify you.

**(d)  ** _ **Service Providers.**_  From time to time, we may enter into relationships with third parties who provide services to us (e.g., data management and storage services or credit card processing services). In those circumstances, we disclose User Information that is necessary for such service providers to perform those services and require that they maintain the confidentiality of such User Information.

**(e)**   _ **Friends.**_   The Site enables you to designate individuals with whom you would like us to share your User Information (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as " **Friends** "). We may share your User Information with your Friends, however we will implement the settings you select with respect to how such information is shared (e.g., providing access, but not editing rights, to documents). In no event, however, will we share any of your User Information that you identify as private. Also, so that other users of the Site can elect to designate you as one of their Friends, certain User Information that you submit will be available to all other users of the Site. The Site pages through which you submit User Information will identify which information will be available to all other users of the Site.

**(f)  ** _ **Other Disclosure Scenarios.**_  Notwithstanding anything in this Privacy Policy to the contrary, we reserve the right, and you hereby expressly authorize us, to share any User Information: (1) in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; (2) if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person or property; (3) if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding significant abuse of the Site’s infrastructure or the Internet in general (such as voluminous spamming, denial of service attacks, or attempts to compromise the security of information); (4) to our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us (in which case we will require such entities to honor this Privacy Policy); and (5) if we are acquired by or merged with another entity.

**4.  Public Information.**  If you identify any User Information as public, you are authorizing us to share such information publicly. For example, you may elect to make certain Shared Information (such as a calendar or photographs) publicly available. Also, there may be areas of the Site (e.g., message boards, discussion rooms, and blogs) in which you are able to post information that will be available to all other users of the Site. By choosing to use these areas, you understand and agree that anyone may access, use, and disclose any information that you post to those areas. If you use these areas of the site you should be aware that any information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.  We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.

**Customer Testimonials**. We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information.  If a testimonial does contain personally identifiable information, we obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial. ****

**5.  Choice/Opt-Out.**  We offer you the opportunity to choose not to receive communications from us. If you would like to take advantage of this opportunity, please let us know by accessing and updating your account settings. You may opt-out from receiving marketing or newsletter communications at anytime by clicking on the unsubscribe link located within each email communication. Please note that sometimes these requests may take up to ten business days to process. Even if you do take advantage of this opportunity, we reserve the right to send you administrative messages relating to the Site (e.g., about changes to this Privacy Policy) and to contact you regarding any goods or services you have ordered.

**6.  Modifying and Deleting Your Personal Information.**  If you would like to modify or delete from our database any User Information you previously submitted to us, please let us know by accessing and updating your profile in your account settings. Please note that any User Information that we have copied may remain in back-up storage for some period of time after your request, and that if you delete certain information you may not be able to order services in the future without re-submitting such information. Also, please note that we will maintain User Information in our database whenever we are required to do so by law.

**7.  Security.**  The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). 

We have implemented reasonable measures to help protect your User Information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access or disclosure. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your User Information, we cannot guarantee its security.

**8.  Links.**  The Site may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any such other website and urge you to review such practices prior to submitting any information to such websites.

**9.  Children’s Privacy.**  We are committed to protecting the privacy needs of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s online activities and interests. The Site is not intended for and may not be used by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 and we do not target the Site to children under the age of 13.

**10.  Changes.  **We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If under any such update we make any material change to the way in which we treat your User Information, we will inform you of such change via e-mail or by posting a notice on relevant areas of the Site. Any updated version of this Privacy Policy will be effective as of the date set forth therein.

**11\. Third Party Information**

**Invite-A-Friend**. If you choose to use our 'Invite a Friend' referral service, we will ask you for your friend’s email address.  We will automatically create your friend a free KeepandShare account to use to sign in and use to view your shared information, and we will send your friend a one-time welcome email inviting him or her to visit the site and use their free account.  Gee Whiz Labs stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and giving your friend access to their KeepandShare account. Your friend may follow the instructions in the welcome email to close their account or instruct KeepandShare to not send them any further emails.

**Address Application**. We allow you to add your friends and families addresses and names to your account so that you may reference them at any time.  You also have the ability to import your contacts as well.  We do not store your email address or password of any other address book that you may use to import your contacts, we will not use your contacts for any reason other than to store them for you. If you wish to delete your friends or families addresses or other personal information you may do so by using the ‘delete’ command on an Address.   
If you send an email to a third party recipient, you have the ability to save the email address that you used to send this third party an email.  We do not use this email address for any reason other then to send the emails to them that you requested we sent.
