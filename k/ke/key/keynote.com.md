Keynote Systems provides subscription- and contract-based Internet performance measurement and analysis services to companies that operate business Web sites. Keynote also provides Web-site performance indexes for publicly-accessible web sites, and publishes these indexes both online and in printed trade publications.

**Use of General Customer Data**

  * Keynote will not reveal to any customer what URLs or transactions another customer is measuring. 
  * Keynote will not reveal to any customer any proprietary consulting reports. 



**Use of Performance Measurements**

Keynote will not share any data about a site that is under development and therefore not public. 

  * From time to time, Keynote may use, distribute or sell the use of the performance data obtained from measuring any URL or transaction on the Internet that either 
    * is publicly accessible without special passwords to any user with a web browser or 
    * requires a special password that Keynote legitimately obtains for its own account. 
  * If anyone contracts Keynote to collect measurement data that requires a password known only to them, we will not distribute or otherwise use that performance data without their permission. 



**Web Visitor Information Collected**  
We collect only the domain name, the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, user-specific information on what pages consumers access or visit and information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations.

**Use of Web Visitor Information Collected Via Online Forms and Surveys**  
Visitor information collected via online forms and surveys is made available only for internal use by Keynote, for research and marketing purposes.
