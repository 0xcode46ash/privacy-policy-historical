  |  | Data collection and its purpose  
  
Your name, phone number, address, and email address are collected when you register an account at Key Survey. You have to enter this information by yourself, and you are solely responsible for its validity.

Key Survey compiles and uses your information so that we may keep you apprised of new products, product enhancements and services that we feel may be of interest to you.

Key Survey collects information about the areas and pages of Key Survey website you visit. We analyze this data to determine what is of interest to our customers as a group, and thereby improve our website. This information is collected in the form of the usual web server logs, cookies and referrals.

Key Survey also collects information to make the website viewable and useful for the majority of our clients. Therefore, we collect information such as your operating system, browser version and the size of your screen.

Key Survey retains all records of your orders, surveys and reports you have completed, and other miscellaneous account information for you. This has been done solely for information and benefit of Key Survey users. This data is not accessible to anyone and any company outside Survey Software Services Inc. besides you, the User.

Key Survey does not share any information about you with any other company, organization, or individual, except for where necessary to complete a purchase that you have authorized.  
   
  
  |  | Survey data  
  
When you publish your survey on the Key Survey server, we will provide you with a unique URL to display your survey. Key Survey will not provide this URL to any other person or entity, but will provide your survey to any web browser requesting your unique URL. Key Survey has the right to review your survey contents for violations of our Terms of Use. If Key Survey determines your survey is in violation of Key Survey Terms of Use we will attempt to contact you and reserve the right to delete your survey and results from our systems.

Key Survey will not attempt to read your survey results at any time unless explicitly instructed to do so by you. We do not own the contents of the data for your survey. Key Survey will only have access to your surveys for purposes of backup and troubleshooting. When your survey results are received by Key Survey, we will store them in a secure location. We will only allow your survey results to be downloaded directly into your desktop software. Key Survey has extensive security measures in place to protect your results while stored on our servers and we will prosecute any attempt to access this information without authorization.  
   
  
  |  | E-Mail Non-disclosure  
  
Our e-mail notification system stores your e-mail addresses on our server in a secured location. These e-mail addresses are kept on the server for tracking and click notification purposes. Much like survey data, these addresses are yours, not the property of Key Survey. Key Survey Customer Support team may examine these lists for support and troubleshooting purposes. Key Survey will never use or sell these e-mail addresses to anyone; any attempt to access your e-mail addresses without your authorization will be prosecuted.

When you provide your email address to receive the Key Survey newsletter we will only use your email to send the newsletter to you. You may opt-out of receiving the Key Survey newsletter at any time by following the instructions provided with it, updating your user profile, or by sending us an email. We will make sure to process your request as soon as possible.
