# Privacy Policy | Kerio

### How We Use the Information We Collect

At Kerio Technologies, we know that you care about how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. Please read the following to understand what information we collect, how we use that information, to whom we may disclose that information, and how we safeguard that information. Because the Internet is global, information about you that we collect or that you submit may be transferred to, processed in, and held in countries (including the United States) other than the one in which you reside. By using our web site, you explicitly consent to such use of your information and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

This Privacy Policy addresses information collection through our web site, www.kerio.com, and related information collected through customer registration of our products. Kerio Technologies reserves the right to change or update this Privacy Policy as our business evolves. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically. Any updated version of this Privacy Policy will be effective as of the date specified in such update. 

### What Information We Collect

As a visitor of our web site, you can engage in many activities without providing any personal information. However, Kerio Technologies may ask you to register and provide information that personally identifies you in connection with other activities, for instance when you register as a customer, download free evaluation software, upgrades, order e-mail newsletters, etc. We also collect personal information from you such as your name, address, contact information and credit card information when you purchase goods or services. 

Kerio Technologies also automatically collects certain information that is not necessarily linked to you by name. For example, we may collect IP addresses of web site users, pages visited, search terms entered in our site and other general information about a user’s visit to our site. 

### How We Use the Information We Collect

We use your personal information to deliver the software you request, to alert you to upgrades and updates, and to share with you special offers and updated information. We also use aggregate data to make the web site easier to use, to improve site performance and content, and to monitor web traffic and usage. Credit card numbers are only used for payment processing and are not retained for marketing purposes. 

You may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, you may opt-out (see below). 

### Links

This web site contains links to other web sites at which personal information may be collected. In such instances, unless otherwise expressly specified, the privacy policy applicable to that other web site will govern the collection and use of your information. Kerio technologies is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other web sites and urges you to review such web sites’ privacy practices prior to submitting any personal information. 

### Disclosure of Your Personal Information

Kerio Technologies will not sell your personal information to anyone. We may share your information to agents who perform limited functions on our behalf, such as delivering packages and processing payments. Those agents have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Note that we use a third party credit card processing company to process payments by customers, but this third party is contractually restricted in its use of information to what is necessary to facilitate the transaction. 

Notwithstanding anything in this Privacy Policy to the contrary, Kerio Technologies reserves the right, unless limited by applicable law, to share any information we have collected about you or that you have submitted: (1) in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; (2) if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person or property; (3) if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding situations that involve significant abuse of our web site infrastructure or the Internet in general (such as voluminous spamming, denial of service attacks, or attempts to compromise the security of information); (4) to our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us (in which case we will require such entities to honor this Privacy Policy); and (5) if we are acquired by or merged with another entity. 

### Public Areas

Your use of areas of our web site that are intended for interaction with other users (e.g., product forums, message boards, and other online forums) may allow you to post personal information. By choosing to use these areas, you understand and agree that anyone may access, use, and disclose any personal information that you post to those areas. 

### Security

When you provide us with a credit card number and other sensitive information, Kerio Technologies will take commercially reasonable steps to protect this information through a secure connection. Your information is stored on physically secured servers and protected using encryption, firewall and password protection. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its security. 

### Cookies and Clear GIFs

Kerio Technologies uses cookies to identify customers when they visit our web site. Cookies are small text files that a web site can send to your browser to be stored automatically on your computer. If you set your browser to reject or disable cookies, you may be prevented access to certain parts of our web site. Kerio may also use clear GIFs, which are one pixel graphic image files on our web site that may collect the time the GIF was viewed or the type of browser that requested the image file.

Please note that sometimes these requests may take up to ten business days to process and that we are not responsible for removing information about you from the database of any third party with which we shared your information prior to processing your request. Even if you do take advantage of this opportunity, we reserve the right to send you administrative messages relating to our web site (e.g., about changes to this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use), to contact you regarding orders you have placed (e.g., order confirmations and shipment tracking information), and, with respect to such orders, to share your information with our agents as discussed above.
