When you submit an enquiry we ask for information such as your name, email address, phone number and criteria specific to your enquiry. This information will be released to a small number of our registered suppliers so that they can contact you regarding the project in question. Your personal information is password-protected so that only Kellysearch and the suppliers selected to receive the enquiry have access to an enquirer's personal information. 

Calls made to companies registered with Kellysearch using the number available on the site will be recorded on a password-protected telephone tracking system. Kellysearch has access to these telephone records and will make no use of them other than for quality and training purposes.
