**Privacy & Usage Policy**

ShPants, Inc. ("we," "us" or "our") has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting the privacy of our website visitors and fan club members. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the websites located at _http://www.KellyClarkson.com_ and _http://www.KellyClarksonStreetTeam.com_ (the "websites"). If you choose not to consent to this Privacy Statement, you may not use these websites. Further, this policy is subject to change, so you should re-read it periodically. 

**1\. How We Use Collected Information**  
Server Logs. Our servers record your computer's IP address and website usage in "server logs" when you use the websites. No personally identifiable information is contained in these logs, such as name, address, phone numbers or email addresses. We use these logs to help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze traffic patterns and to administer the websites. 

> **Cookies**.   
>  We use cookies on certain pages of our websites. Cookies are small text files stored on your hard drive, not on our websites. A cookie is not a program, and does not itself have the ability to automatically collect personal information about you. A cookie can store certain information that identifies your browser to our servers in order to make the websites operate more smoothly. For example, we use cookies to aid in the functioning of the shopping cart and sign in form. Most cookies we use are "session cookies" which means that they are automatically deleted when you leave the websites. Some of our advertising partners may also use cookies. We do not have access to or control over such cookies. 
> 
> **Registration.**  
>  If you choose to register with our websites, our registration forms require you to give us certain information including your name, address, zip/postal code, phone number, email address, and date of birth. In addition, to join the Kelly Clarkson Fan Club or to purchase products or services from the websites, you will be required to give us your credit card information in order to process the membership fee or purchase price. Personally identifying information is used to contact you when necessary in the day to day running of the websites. In addition, financial information that is collected is used to check your qualifications for registration and to bill you for products and services you may purchase through the websites. 
> 
> **Voluntary Contact.**   
>  If you send us information voluntarily, such as through personal correspondence, email, or chat rooms, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on our websites, we may collect such information. We use such information, and other information that we obtain from your use of the services, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Terms of Use agreement, among other things. Please also note that information you volunteer in public areas, such as chat rooms and bulletin boards, is not protected information, and anyone could potentially collect and use such information in ways we cannot control. 
> 
> In addition to using your information as described above, we also may occasionally send you email announcing special promotions, changes in our services, and other information we believe will be of interest to you. You may opt in or out of receiving these mailings by using the join/unsubscribe feature located in the Fan Club portions of our websites at _http://www.KellyClarkson.com_ and _http://www.KellyClarksonStreetTeam.com._
> 
> We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Statement. For example, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances without your consent, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability. However, we will not use your information for marketing purposes outside of the Kelly Clarkson Fan Club or Dog Pound sites. We do not sell or rent our list of users past or present to any third party without your consent.

**2\. Linked Websites**  
For your convenience, the websites contain links to other sites. Please be aware that neither KellyClarkson.com nor KellyClarksonStreetTeam.com is responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other websites, which may differ significantly from our own. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our websites and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by our websites. 

**3\. Security**  
The websites have procedural security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Only authorized individuals have access to your information. On all pages where user credit card information is entered, we utilize a secure digital server, with a secure certificate from VeriSign. Notwithstanding these efforts, we caution you that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. 

**4\. A Special Note About Children**  
Persons under the age of 18 are not eligible to use our websites without parental supervision and consent and we ask that children under the age of 13 not submit personal information to us. We believe that is important that parents supervise their minor children when they are online. As a result, we require that persons under the age of 18 use these websites only in conjunction with parents or legal guardians. 

**5\. Fan Club Membership**  
Membership to the official Kelly Clarkson fan club may be obtained by submitting the form at http://www.KellyClarkson.com/fanclub.aspx. The fan club community is strictly moderated by website administrators. Messages deemed to be innapropriate for any reason may be edited, deleted or locked. Abuse of the message board or chat room will result in the revoking membership priveleges and/or a discontinuation of membership altogether. Membership will also be terminated without refund if 'members only' content is distributed or displayed without written consent. We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason.

**6\. Contacting Us**   
If you have any questions about this Privacy Statement, the practices of this websites, or your dealings with these websites, you may use the "Contact" forms on either KellyClarkson.com or KellyClarksonStreetTeam.com.
