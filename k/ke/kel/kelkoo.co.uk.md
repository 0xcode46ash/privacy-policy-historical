# Kelkoo - Compare. Buy. Save.

At Kelkoo, we are committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology that gives you the most powerful and safe online experience that you can get anywhere

We use the information we collect about you to provide a personalised shopping experience and to notify you about enhancements to our site and any offers or promotions that we believe you will want to know about.

**What information do we collect? How do we use it?**

Personal information will be collected when you register on the Kelkoo.com site, use a service, or enter an online competition.

Your information will be used to personalise your shopping experience, enabling us to shape our recommendations so that we can tell you about products and promotions that we believe might be of interest to you.

We also monitor general customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the Kelkoo.com site.

We also use a "Personal Profile Page", which enables you to update your personal information at any time and/or request that we delete your information from our records. This allows us to maintain accurate and up-to-date personal data.

**Your Consent**

By using our web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Kelkoo. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it.

**What about "cookies"?**

Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many major websites use them to provide useful features for their customers. Cookies do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to prevent that. This should not prevent you from using most of the features on our website.

**Will Kelkoo disclose the information it collects to outside parties?**

No! Kelkoo.com does not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others, unless we have your specific consent to do so. We simply use the information we collect on our site to enhance your shopping experience.

Kelkoo.com may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.

The only time your information may be "sold" to a third party is if the whole business of Kelkoo.com is sold to another company. If you do not wish your information to be passed on please send an e-mail to [feedback.uk@Kelkoo.com](mailto:feedback.uk@kelkoo.com)

Kelkoo.com does reserve the right to access and disclose individually identifiable information to comply with applicable laws and lawful government requests, to operate its systems properly or to protect itself or its users.

We welcome your questions and comments about privacy issues and the design of our website. Should you have such comments or have a complaint about how we are using your personal data, please send an e-mail to [feedback.uk@Kelkoo.com](mailto:feedback.uk@kelkoo.com)

You have the right to ask for a copy of the information we hold on you at any time. You also have the right to have any inaccuracies corrected.
