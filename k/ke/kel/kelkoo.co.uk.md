##  How do we protect Personal Information?

We employ all industry standard practices and have strict security procedures covering the collection, storage and disclosure of Personal Information in order to prevent unauthorised access and to comply with relevant European data protection laws. All Personal Information you provide to us is stored on our or our business partners' secure servers. The secure servers encrypt all Personal Information you input before it is sent to us. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

##  What are cookies and web beacons and how do we use them?

A cookie is a small amount of information which is sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. A web beacon is a small image (usually embedded in a web page or email) that allows a web site to count users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies.

These tracking devices help us to improve our Website and to deliver a better and more personalised service. They enable us to: (a) estimate our audience size and usage pattern; (b) store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise our Website according to your individual interests; (c) speed up your searches; and (d) recognise you when you return to our Website. In addition to our cookies, we allow certain third parties and affiliates to set and access cookies on your computer. Some of these third parties may collect and use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to serve you content that might be of interest to you. These third parties' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies and not Kelkoo's.

You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our Website. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our Website.

##  Where do we store Personal Information?

We hold Personal Information on servers in the UK and Ireland. Some Personal Information may also be transferred to servers in Sweden and the USA managed by a third party processor on our behalf. US laws on holding Personal Information are less stringent than the laws applicable in the European Economic Area ("EEA"), but we will hold and transmit your Personal Information in accordance with this privacy policy and applicable European data protection laws.

##  Access to information

You have the right to access information held about you. If you would like to receive a copy of your Personal Information held by us, please write to us at Legal Department, Kelkoo.com (UK) Limited. We may charge you a small administrative fee to meet our costs in providing you with details of your Personal Information which we hold.
