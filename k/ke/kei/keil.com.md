#### Customer Database

We maintain a customer database and from time-to-time send mail through the postal service to customers listed in this database. If you wish to be excluded from our mailings, please contact our [customer service department](https://web.archive.org/product/custserv.asp).

#### E-mail Addresses

E-mail addresses are **NEVER** used for SPAM or unsolicited e-mail messages. E-mail addresses **ARE** used to help us cross-reference your database information.

Some forms ask if you would like to receive an e-mail message when a new software update is posted to the web site. If you do not wish to receive e-mail notifications of these updates, make sure that you un-check that control in the form.

### With Whom is the Information Shared?

 **Keil** will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.

We may occasionally share aggregated **demographic** information with our tool partners. This information is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

We use outside shipping companies (like FedEx, UPS, Airborne, USPS, and courier services) to ship orders. Therefore, we must provide your name, mailing address, and phone number to them. If you do not wish us to share this information, you may pick up your product from our offices.

We accept credit card orders and, on occasion, must provide the customer name and address information to VISA, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover for verification purposes. If you do not wish us to verify your credit card, you may use an alternate form of payment.

We partner with other embedded tools companies and chip manufacturers to provide you with important or interesting information about products or services that you may find beneficial. On occasion, we provide names and other contact information that are necessary for these companies to provide such information via a one-time mailing. Information transferred is used for only one mailing. To prevent the sharing of your information with these companies, refer to the section on opting-out.

### What Security Precautions are in Effect?

 **Keil** takes every precaution to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, that information is protected both online and off-line.

All forms on this web site are available in both non-secure and secure formats. Secure forms encrypt and protect information with the best encryption software in the industry -- SSL. While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just _surfing_. To learn more about our SSL certificate, refer to [http://www.keil.com/company/cert_ssl.asp](https://web.archive.org/company/cert_ssl.asp).

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our accounts receivable clerk or technical support personnel) are granted access to personally identifiable information. All database access is password-protected. Our employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure, locked environment.

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [security@keil.com](mailto:security@keil.com).

### Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Most of the forms on this web site attempt to store and/or retrieve cookies from your computer. The cookies requested contain information such as:

  * Name,
  * Title,
  * Company Name,
  * Address,
  * Phone & FAX Numbers,
  * E-mail Address,
  * and Product Serial Number.



When you enter and submit your personal information in a form on our web site, we send your browser a cookie that contains this information. Cookies we send are set to expire in 180 days (6 months). Subsequent visits to a form on our web site request the cookie and automatically fill-in the form. We automatically complete forms this way to save you time and avoid the redundant entry of information.

If you are concerned about cookies we store on your computer, you may disable cookies in your browser. If your browser rejects cookies, you may still use our site. The only drawback is that the information in the cookie must be manually entered each time you return to one of our forms. For example, each time you download an update your user information must be re-entered.

### Log Files

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the web site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

### Links

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that **Keil** is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. In most cases, a new browser window opens when you link out of the Keil web site.

This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the Keil Web site.

### Surveys

From time-to-time our web site requests information via user surveys. Participation in a survey is completely voluntary and you, therefore, have a choice of whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

### Correcting or Updating Personal Information

If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if you no longer desire our service, we endeavor to provide a way to correct, update, or remove the personal data provided to us. Contact our [customer service department](https://web.archive.org/product/custserv.asp) to make changes to your personal information.

We do not offer a way to retrieve the information you provide us on-line. However, you may use the [Customer Information Maintenance Form](https://web.archive.org/product/custserv.asp) to request a copy of your personal information.

### Opting Out

We want to give you every opportunity to opt-out of receiving undesired mailings or e-mail from us or from our partners.

  * You may [remove your e-mail address](https://web.archive.org/update/udremove.asp) from our Update List Server.
  * You may [block the sharing of your information](https://web.archive.org/product/custserv.asp) with third parties.
  * You may [remove or update your personal information](https://web.archive.org/product/custserv.asp) maintained in our customer database.
  * Contact our [customer service department](https://web.archive.org/product/custserv.asp) for any other requests you may have.



To remove your e-mail address from one of our list servers, follow the directions at the bottom of the e-mail.

### Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes at <http://www.keil.com/company/privacy_changes.asp> so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by e-mail. You will have a choice as to whether or not we may use your information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
