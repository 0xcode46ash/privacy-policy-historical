# Keil Software Privacy Statement

At Keil Software, we understand that privacy is a concern of many of our customers. For that reason, we have established the following policies concerning the information we collect on our web site.

### Who Collects the Information from this Site?

**Keil Software** collects and is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.

### Where is Information Collected?

**Keil Software** collects information at several different points on this web site including the following forms: 

  * [Product Registration](http://www.keil.com/support/register.htm),
  * [Downloading a Product Update](https://web.archive.org/update/),
  * [Requesting Technical Support](https://web.archive.org/support/gethelp.htm),
  * [Requesting a Quote](https://web.archive.org/product/prices.htm),
  * [Requesting Product Information](https://web.archive.org/product/literature.asp),
  * [Registering for a Training Course](https://web.archive.org/training/),
  * [Adding your name to our E-mail List](https://web.archive.org/update/list.asp),
  * and [Requesting a FREE CD-ROM](https://web.archive.org/demo/cdrom.htm).



These forms request you to enter personal information that is sent to **Keil Software** over the internet. You may select to use our secure server (SSL/HTTPS pages) to ensure that the information you send is encrypted and secure.

### What Information is Collected?

The information that is collected typically consists of the following:

  * Name,
  * Title,
  * Company Name,
  * Address,
  * Phone & FAX Numbers,
  * E-mail Address,
  * and Product Serial Number.



### How is the Information Used?

We use the information you enter to maintain our customer database. 

From time-to-time we send mail to this database. If you wish to be excluded from our mailings, please contact our [sales department](https://web.archive.org/product/sales.htm). 

Demographic information is used to determine trends in our customers' use of our products. This helps us design new products and services that help our customer meet their goals. 

E-mail addresses are **NEVER** used for SPAM or unsolicited e-mail messages. E-mail addresses **ARE** used to help us connect the e-mail messages you send us to your database record. 

Some forms ask if you would like to receive an e-mail message when a new software update is posted to the web site. If you do not wish to receive e-mail notifications of these updates, make sure that you un-check the controls in these forms. 

### With Whom is the Information Shared?

**Keil Software** will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. 

We may occasionally share aggregated **demographic** information with our tool partners. This information is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

We use outside shipping companies (like FedEx, UPS, and Airborne) to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

We partner with other companies to provide our customers with important or interesting information about products or services that they may find beneficial. On occasion, we provide names and other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide such information (usually via mail). 

### What Security Precautions are in Effect?

[ ](https://digitalid.verisign.com/as2/55464fbce992c07ab00982a6524b5f46)**Keil Software** takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, that information is protected both online and off-line. 

All forms on this web site are available in both non-secure and secure formats. Secure forms encrypt and protect information with the best encryption software in the industry -- SSL. While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just _surfing_. To learn more about SSL, refer to [http://www.verisign.com](http://www.verisign.com/). 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our accounts receivable clerk or technical support personnel) are granted access to personally identifiable information. All database access is password-protected. Our employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure, locked environment. 

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [security@keil.com](mailto:security@keil.com). 

### Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Most of the forms on this web site attempt to store and/or retrieve cookies from your computer. The cookies requested contain information such as: 

  * Name,
  * Title,
  * Company Name,
  * Address,
  * Phone & FAX Numbers,
  * E-mail Address,
  * and Product Serial Number.



When you enter and submit your personal information in a form on our web site, we send your browser a cookie that contains this information. Cookies we send are set to expire in 180 days (6 months). Subsequent visits to a form on our web site request the cookie and automatically fills-in the form. We automatically complete forms this way to save you time and avoid the redundant entry of information. 

If you are concerned about cookies we store on your computer, you may disable cookies in your browser. If your browser rejects cookies, you may still use our site. The only drawback is that the information in the cookie must be manually entered each time you return to one of our forms. For example, the next time you download an update, your user information must be re-entered. 

### Log Files

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

### Links

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that **Keil Software** is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the Keil Software Web site. 

### Surveys

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user, therefore, has a choice of whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 

### Correction or Updating Personal Information

If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update, or remove that user’s personal data provided to us. Contact our [sales department](https://web.archive.org/product/sales.htm) to make changes to your personal information. 

### Opting Out

We want to give you every opportunity to opt-out of receiving undesired mailings or e-mail. 

  * Use a [web form](https://web.archive.org/update/remove.asp) to remove your e-mail address from our Update List,
  * Contact our [sales department](https://web.archive.org/product/sales.htm) to remove your address from our database or to stop receiving mass mailings.



To remove your e-mail address from one of our list servers, follow the directions at the bottom of the e-mail. 

### Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes at <http://www.keil.com/company/privacy_changes.htm> so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
