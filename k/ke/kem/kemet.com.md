**Privacy Statement for www.kemet.com**  


We at KEMET have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy. As individuals, we expect others to respect our privacy and you should expect nothing less of us. Here are our information-gathering and dissemination practices for our website: www.kemet.com.

Our site uses different forms for registration, feedback, notification and authentication. Depending on the use of the data, each form will require different data about you such as your name, title, company, address, or e-mail address.
