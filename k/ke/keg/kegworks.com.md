Why We Collect Information  
First and foremost, KegWorks collects information to improve the product offerings and site features that we present to you via our site. We also use your information to measure our site's success and performance. Collecting information about what products you are interested in and what site features you use helps us to improve our site for you.

Looking at this compiled information allows us to give you a better KegWorks! 

Personal Information We Collect  
Personal information that we collect is provided (to us, by you) on a strictly voluntary basis. We may receive personal information from you in a number of ways, depending on the service you are using and your choices while using our services. 

We may ask you for, and you may choose to send to us, your name, email address, physical address or other personal information necessary to complete a transaction or provide services to you. For example, we collect information you provide when you place an order, register with us, send us an email or call us, enter a sweepstakes, or enroll to receive our newsletters. This information may include:

You, our customer, voluntarily provide all of this information. Wherever we ask you for personal information, we try to include a link to this Privacy Policy for your review. 

Use of Personal Information  
As noted above, unless you voluntarily provide personal information for a specific purpose, we do not collect personal information from you. If you choose to provide personal information, we use your personal information to provide you with particular services that you request. For instance, we may use your personal information to ship a product that you have ordered or to provide you with billing and status information regarding your order. 

KegWorks does not sell, trade or rent personal information to other companies. In certain instances, we may share your personal information with our consultants, third party auditors and other third parties who make our site available, enhance its functionality or provide associated services. This may include those who process your orders, order your products, provide you with services or supply your sweepstake gifts and prizes. These third parties are not allowed to use personal information except for the purposes of providing the applicable services. In addition, we may provide information to law enforcement authorities or pursuant to a court order or to investigate suspected fraud. Our site and services are maintained in the United States of America. By using the site and/or services, you authorize the export of personal information to the USA and its storage and use as specified in this policy. 

Aggregate Information We Collect and Use  
In addition to personal information, we may also collect non-personally identifiable information, such as site pages viewed, browser type, computer information, cookies, clickstream data and other information. Such aggregate information is anonymous and does not identify any individual user. 

"Cookies" are small data files that are sent to your browser and are stored on your hard drive, keeping track of your general activity on the Web. When you make subsequent visits to our site your cookie gives us a summary of your preferences and past experiences on the site. This allows us to tailor our product offerings more distinctly to your interests. 

"Clickstream data" is a trail of electronic information that is left at each Web site you visit. This information can be collected and stored by a site's server. We may, for example, use clickstream data to tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use, the address of the site from which you linked to our site, how much time you spend on each page of our site, how you navigate throughout the site and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the your needs.

Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, if your credit card is used without your authorization, your liability for those fraudulent charges cannot exceed $50.
