### Company Sale

Information collected through our Website is considered a trade secret of DNC P&R.  As the owner of such information, we may disclose or sell such information as an asset of the company in conjunction with the sale to a third party of our company or a portion of our assets.

### Aggregate Information

We collect aggregate information about you and your use of our Website whenever you visit us online (See “Information About You” above).  For instance, we may collect various forms of “click stream” information such as entry and exit points for our Website (i.e., referring URLs or domains), site traffic statistics, page views, impressions, and operating system and browser type.  In addition, when you request pages on our Website, our servers automatically log your IP addresses.  An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the internet. 

We also use third-party software that tracks traffic directed to the Website from affiliate Websites and the purchases that result from this traffic.  This information is aggregated and is not tied to an individual purchase.

This aggregate information generally will not identify you or be correlated to you individually for external purposes.  We may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and all aggregate information provided that such information does not reveal your identity.  When we share such information with other companies, it is not traceable to any particular user, and will not be used to contact you.  If we do correlate any aggregate information to you, such information will be treated like any other personal information under this statement.

### Links to Other Sites

Please be aware that we provide links to third-party Websites as a service to our users, and that we are not responsible for the content or information collection practices of those pages.  Please note that these Websites' privacy policies may differ from those of DNC P&R.  We encourage you to review and understand their privacy practices before providing them with information.

### Children

Our Website is intended for a general audience.  However, it is not designed nor intended to collect personal information from children under the age of 13.  To respect the privacy of children and to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, children under the age of 13 should not provide any personal information on this Website.  We ask that parents supervise their children while online.

### Security

DNC P&R is committed to safeguarding and securing your personal information.  To maintain data accuracy, prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of, and ensure the appropriate use of your personal information, we have put in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures.  When we ask for credit card data, it is transferred over a Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) line provided you are using an SSL-enabled browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer.  This ensures that your information is encrypted as it travels through the Internet.  This secure mode is enabled before any such information is transmitted from your computer.  You will know that you are in “secure mode” when the padlock or key icon in the lower-right-hand or lower-left-hand corner of the computer screen appears in the locked position.  In addition, when accessing a secure server, the first characters of the Website address will change from “http” to “https.”

### Opting Out of Promotional Materials

As noted above, we may use your e-mail address and other contact information provided to us through the Website to send promotional materials to you.  If you do not want to receive such promotional information, you can change your privacy preference and remove yourself from our e-mail list at any time.

### Access and Accuracy

DNC P&R strives to keep your personal information accurate.  We will provide you with access to your personal information, including making reasonable efforts to provide you with online access to your email community subscription or press room registration data so that you may review, update or correct your information at the Site.  To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access or enabling you to make corrections.  To access your personal information, return to the Website where you originally entered and update your information.  If you cannot access your information on the web page, please telephone us at 866-737-5235 for assistance, or [click here](https://web.archive.org/contact-us.aspx) to send your request.  We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, would be extremely impractical or for which access is not otherwise required.  We will provide information access and correction free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.
