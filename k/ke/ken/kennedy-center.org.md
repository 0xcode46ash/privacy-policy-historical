**1\. Information Collection and Use**. ****

  * **Anonymity**.  
You may purchase tickets and remain anonymous if you choose to pay by cash in person at our Box Office. 
  * **General Information**.   
You may visit and browse our websites as often as you like without logging in and no personal information about your visit will be collected. If you visit our websites simply to browse, we may collect general information about the way in which you use our websites, including, but not limited to, the time and duration of visit, type of web browser used, the operating system/ platform you are using, your IP address, the websites from which you linked to us, and your CPU speed. We also may note whether and how you use the websites by recording site traffic patterns and clickstreams. We do not associate this general information that we collect with any personal information and we do not otherwise monitor this information on an individual basis. Instead, we aggregate this usage information and use it only to identify the levels and areas of interest in the Kennedy Center and to improve and refine our websites and services. We may perform (or have third parties perform) analyses of visitors' behavior, and may share aggregated, anonymous data with sponsors and advertisers. 
  * **Personal Information**. 
    * The Kennedy Center collects personal information when you make a purchase or a contribution, register as an E-Patron, request information on our products and services, participate in a promotion or an online survey, contact the Kennedy Center with a question or suggestion, apply for employment with the Kennedy Center, and when you attend certain special events where heightened security is necessary. Depending on the nature of your interaction with the Kennedy Center, we may ask you for information such as your name, phone number, physical address, social security number, birth date, company related information, email address, credit card information including expiration date and billing address, and product preferences. Once you register with the Kennedy Center and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. 
    * Your personal information may be used by us (or third parties engaged by us) to: (1) customize the advertising and the content that you see, (2) fulfill your requests for products and services, (3) contact you, (4) conduct research, (5) respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, and (6) establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. 
    * In addition, the Kennedy Center may provide your name and address or phone number to third parties whose products we believe may be of interest to you (although we do not share any other information about you, the selection criteria may result in the third party being able to identify your relationship with the Kennedy Center in a broad manner, i.e., that you are a subscriber or donor, or may have attended a particular production). You can request at anytime that we do not share your name and address or phone numbers with such third parties. The Kennedy Center does not monitor or control the privacy policies of third parties. 
    * Certain performances at the Kennedy Center are produced or presented by third parties. Examples of these third parties include the Washington Opera, the Washington Performing Arts Society, and the Washington Ballet. When you make a purchase to a performance presented or produced by one of these third party organizations, the Kennedy Center will provide them with the information regarding your purchase. This information may include, but shall not be limited to, your name, address, telephone number and email address, as well as details of your purchase, which may include, but shall not be limited to, the date you purchased your tickets, any offer you responded to, the locations of your seats, and the dollar amount of your transaction. 

Any emails sent to you by the Kennedy Center offer you the option to be removed from the emailing list. You may request to be removed from our mailing or phone list at anytime. Also, you can edit personal information in your account with us, specifically your name, address, phone number, interest preferences and contact preferences through our websites or by contacting us at the phone number or mailing address listed at the end of this document. 




**2\. Personal Information of Children**.  
We do not solicit personal information from children. Sites specifically geared toward children will not request any personal or contact information. You must be 13 years of age or older to register as an E-Patron. 

**3\. Technology  
**We may use “cookie” technology.   A cookie is a small amount of data sent by our websites and stored on your computer's hard drive that our site can read and which helps us keep track of how you use our websites.   Many web browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but contain an option for you to turn off the cookie acceptance if you prefer. If you turn off acceptance, there may be some features of our websites that will not be available to you and some webpages may not display properly. We do not allow unrelated third parties to set cookies via the Kennedy Center websites. 

The Kennedy Center does not use electronic images known as Web beacons to monitor the activity of our Web site or email messages. Used in combination with cookies, a Web beacon is an often-transparent graphic image, usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, which is placed on a Web site or in an e-mail that is used to monitor and track behavior of the user visiting the Web. 

**4\. Links**  
Our websites may include links to other websites. We do not control the privacy policies of the destination sites. Once you leave our servers (you can check where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, you should contact the manager of that site for more information. The Kennedy Center is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of websites other than the Kennedy Center websites. 

**5\. Security and Disclaimer**  
Although we use security that we believe to be appropriate to protect your personal information, we do not guarantee that our security precautions will protect against, and we expressly disclaim any liability for, any loss, misuse, or alteration of your personal information. 

**6\. Changes to this Privacy Policy**  
The Kennedy Center may update this policy at any time. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the email address that you have provided us or by placing a prominent notice on our websites.
