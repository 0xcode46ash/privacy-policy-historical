You may visit and browse the Kennedy Center's websites as often as you like without logging in and no personal information about your visit will be collected.

The Kennedy Center collects personal information when you make a purchase or a contribution online, register an account, utilize our network, request information about our products and services, participate in a promotion or an online survey, contact the Kennedy Center with a question or suggestion, apply for employment with the Kennedy Center, and when you attend certain special events where heightened security is necessary. 

**How Information is Collected**

__We may ask you to provide specific information._ _ Depending on the nature of your interaction with the Kennedy Center, we may ask you for information such as your name, phone number, physical address, birth date, company related information, email address, credit card information including expiration date and billing address, and product preferences. Under certain less common and special circumstances, we may ask you for other information such as your social security number. In such cases, we will inform you of the reason we are requesting that information and how it will be used.

__We may use Cookies, tracking tags and other technology._ _The Kennedy Center uses cookies and other tracking mechanisms across our websites and social media platforms. These technologies work by sending a small amount of data from our websites which is stored on your computer's hard drive ("cookies"). Our site can then read this cookie, which helps us keep track of how you use our websites and remember your preferences. Many web browsers accept cookies by default but contain an option for you to turn off cookie acceptance if you prefer. If you turn off acceptance, there may be some features of our websites that will not be available to you and some webpages may not display properly. 

In addition, the Kennedy Center incorporates tracking or measurement tools into our websites and other communications which enable us to track your browsing activity on Kennedy Center websites as well as across social media platforms or other non-Kennedy Center websites and applications (known as "tracking tags", "web beacons," "action tags" or "single-pixel gifs"). If you utilize services which are linked to these tracking tags, these third-party services may also provide non-personal information to the Kennedy Center about your activity on non-Kennedy Center websites and social media platforms, which we may utilize to increase the effectiveness of our promotional efforts and to personalize our services and offerings for you. 

Cookies, tracking tags, and embedded third-party features provide overall usage patterns for our websites that we use for analysis and to provide personalized services and advertising content.   Your browsing may be tracked by these third-party services for their own use and for their clients.  Such tracking could give information about you as an individual to third-parties based on your browsing activity, but this information will not include personal information unless you specifically provide it. 

The ability of tracking tags to gather and use your information through any **** third-party services is governed by that service's privacy policy, which may differ from the Kennedy Center's policies.   The Kennedy Center is not responsible for the privacy practices or the use of the data collected by these third-party services. ****

**How Information is Used**

First and foremost, the Kennedy Center uses any information you provide to us to provide you with products and services such as online ticket and gift shop purchases, newsletter subscriptions and other specifically requested information and activities. In addition, we may perform (or have third parties perform) analyses of visitors' behavior, and may share data with sponsors, advertisers, and collaborators. 

**4\. Security and Disclaimer**

Although we use security that we believe to be appropriate to protect your personal information, we do not guarantee that our security precautions will protect against, and we expressly disclaim any liability for, any loss, misuse, or alteration of your personal information.

**5\. Personal Information of Children**

The Kennedy Center does not allow children under the age of 13 to register a Kennedy Center account. The Kennedy Center will not knowingly ask children under 13 for any personally identifiable information.

**6\. Changes to this Privacy Policy**

You may choose to only receive certain types of email messages, or none at all.
