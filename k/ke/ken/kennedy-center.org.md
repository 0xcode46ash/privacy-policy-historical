# Kennedy Center: Privacy Statement

This policy covers how the Kennedy Center treats the personal information that it collects from its patrons in any manner, including via phone, by mail, at the Kennedy Center and through the following Kennedy Center websites: 

Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable such as your name, address, email address, or phone number, or other information that is not otherwise publicly available, including information related to your usage of the Kennedy Center’s products and services. 

**1\. Information Collection and Use**

**General Information**  
You may visit and browse the Kennedy Center’s websites as often as you like without logging in and no personal information about your visit will be collected. If you visit our websites simply to browse, we may collect general information about the way in which you use our websites, including, but not limited to, the time and duration of visit, type of web browser used, the operating system/ platform you are using, your IP address, and the websites from which you linked to us. We also may note whether and how you use the websites by recording site traffic patterns and clickstreams. We do not associate this general information that we collect with any personal information and we do not otherwise monitor this information on an individual basis. Instead, we aggregate this usage information and use it only to identify the levels and areas of interest in the Kennedy Center and to improve and refine our websites and services. We may perform (or have third parties perform) analyses of visitors' behavior, and may share aggregated, anonymous data with sponsors and advertisers.

**Personal Information**  
Certain performances at the Kennedy Center are produced or presented by third parties. When you make a purchase to a performance presented or produced by one of these third party organizations, the Kennedy Center may provide them with information regarding your purchase. This information may include, but shall not be limited to, your name, address, telephone number and email address, as well as details of your purchase, which may include, but shall not be limited to, the date you purchased your tickets, any offer you responded to, the locations of your seats, and the dollar amount of your transaction.

  * The Kennedy Center collects personal information when you make a purchase or a contribution online, register an account, request information about our products and services, participate in a promotion or an online survey, contact the Kennedy Center with a question or suggestion, apply for employment with the Kennedy Center, and when you attend certain special events where heightened security is necessary. Depending on the nature of your interaction with the Kennedy Center, we may ask you for information such as your name, phone number, physical address,  birth date, company related information, email address, credit card information including expiration date and billing address, and product preferences.  Under certain less common and special circumstances, we may ask you for other information such as your social security number.   In such cases, we will inform you of the reason we are requesting that information and how it will be used.  

  * Your personal information may be used by us (or third parties engaged by us) to: (1) customize the advertising and the content that you see, (2) fulfill your requests for products and services, (3) contact you, (4) conduct research, (5) respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, and (6) establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.  

  * In addition, the Kennedy Center may provide your name and address or phone number to third parties whose products we believe may be of interest to you (although we do not share any other information about you, the selection criteria may result in the third party being able to identify your relationship with the Kennedy Center in a broad manner, i.e., that you are a subscriber or donor, or may have attended a particular production). You can request at anytime that we do not share your name and address or phone numbers with such third parties. The Kennedy Center does not monitor or control the privacy policies of such third parties.  




**Anonymity**  
While you are logged into your Kennedy Center account to purchase tickets or use other online services, you are not anonymous to us online. If you wish to browse our site anonymously you will need to log out of your online account. You may purchase tickets anonymously if you choose to pay by cash in person at our Box Office.

**Account Information and Preferences**  
Except for email messages related to a direct action by you, such as a password reset request or order confirmation, any email messages sent to you by the Kennedy Center offer you the option to request not to receive future email messages.   You may choose to only receive certain types of email messages, or none at all. You may request to be removed from our mailing or phone list at anytime by accessing the Contact Preferences on your account [here](https://www.kennedy-center.org/secure/epatron/forms/gateway.cfm?action=contact_pref):  ([https://www.kennedy-center.org//secure/epatron/forms/gateway.cfm?action=contact_pref](https://www.kennedy-center.org/secure/epatron/forms/gateway.cfm?action=contact_pref)) or by contacting us at the phone number or mailing address listed at the end of this document.

  * In addition to changing Contact Preferences, you may alter or change certain information associated with your account, such as your name, physical address, phone numbers, email address, and your interests by logging into our website or contacting us at the address or phone number below.  If you wish to inactivate your Kennedy Center account, please contact us at the address listed below. 



**2\. Personal Information of Children**

The Kennedy Center allows children under the age of 13 to register an account with verification from a parent or guardian. Use of these accounts enhances the child’s interaction with educational content, such as allowing the child to tag or bookmark content.   Registrants under the age of 13 are required to provide an email address for a parent or guardian (collectively, “parent(s)”) who will be notified of the child’s attempt to register an account and have the opportunity to approve or deny the account. The account will only be fully activated once the Kennedy Center receives a verification response from a parent. Parents will have the ability to login using their child’s account to access all content which is available to their children.

The only information requested by the Kennedy Center for registration by a person under the age of 13 is a username (which should be distinct from the user’s email or personal name), date of birth (for purposes of age validation only, this information will not be stored), a password, and a parent’s email address.   A verification request will be sent to the parent at the address provided.  If the parent denies permission for the account or fails to validate the account within 7 days, the child will no longer be able to login to the account.  

The Kennedy Center will not ask children under 13 for any additional personally identifiable information without first getting a parent’s permission. Parents will receive an email notifying them of any attempt by their child to change the email or password associated with the account.   Parents may choose to deactivate their child’s account at any time. 

**3\. Technology**

The Kennedy Center uses "cookie" technology on some parts of our websites. A cookie is a small amount of data sent by our websites and stored on your computer's hard drive that our site can read and which helps us keep track of how you use our websites and remember your preferences. Many web browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but contain an option for you to turn off the cookie acceptance if you prefer. If you turn off acceptance, there may be some features of our websites that will not be available to you and some webpages may not display properly. We do not allow unrelated third parties to set cookies via the Kennedy Center websites.

The Kennedy Center does not use tracking or measurement tools that would allow your individual browsing activity to be tracked across third-party websites or that would give information about you as an individual to third-parties based on your browsing activity.  

**4\. Links**

Our websites may include links to other websites. We do not control the privacy policies or terms of service of the destination sites. Once you leave our servers (you can check where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, you should contact the manager of that site for more information. The Kennedy Center is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of websites other than the Kennedy Center websites.

**5\. Security and Disclaimer**

Although we use security that we believe to be appropriate to protect your personal information, we do not guarantee that our security precautions will protect against, and we expressly disclaim any liability for, any loss, misuse, or alteration of your personal information.

**6\. Changes to this Privacy Policy**

The Kennedy Center may update this policy at any time. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the email address that you have provided us or by placing a prominent notice on our websites.

**7\. Questions and Suggestions**
