# My San Antonio: Privacy Policy

**Our Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy describes how MSA.com, LLC("MySA") treats the personally identifiable information that is collected about you when you visit MySanAntonio.com, the website of The San Antonio Express-News, a publication of Hearst Newspapers Partnership, LP ("Hearst") and KENS TV, a station of Belo Communications, Inc. ("Belo"). Hearst and Belo are referred to as our "Partners". The information collected on MySanAntonio.com may be shared with our Partners, and used by them in accordance with the terms set forth in this policy. This privacy policy also applies to those website pages of The San Antonio Express-News and KENS TV that are accessible through links on MySanAntonio.com. If you have any questions or concerns about these privacy guidelines, please send an e-mail to webmaster at: [feedback@MySanAntonio.com](mailto:feedback@mysanantonio.com)

Any information you provide when you visit web sites other than those covered by this policy (including other web sites affiliated with our Partners) or when you purchase any products or services that may be offered or advertised on our web site by companies other than MySA is subject to the privacy policies of the third party organizations who run and/or own these web sites. This policy also does not apply to information you may provide to us or our Partners offline.

**Your IP Address:**  
An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers -- the computers that send out Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address. MySA collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site. MySA does not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules and policies or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers or others. 

**Cookies:**  
Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you're at a site. The use of cookies is an industry standard -- you'll find them at most major Web sites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers or from our affiliate sites. MySA does not control these cookies, and they may or may not collect personally identifiable information. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry. MySA (or third party service providers on our behalf) may also use cookies to collect aggregate information about web site users on an anonymous basis. We may share aggregate demographic and usage information with our prospective and actual business partners, advertisers and other third parties, including our Partners, for any business purpose.

**Collection of Personally Identifiable Information:**  
MySA and its Partners generally collect personally identifiable information when you specifically and knowingly provide us with it. For instance, when you enter a sweepstakes or contest, complete a survey, subscribe to the Express-News, or subscribe to our newsletters, you will be asked to provide information such as your e-mail address, name, phone number, and sometimes shipping address. Optional information such as your age or gender may also be requested.

MySA and its Partners use this information to provide you with the service you have requested. If you subscribe to the Express-News, we may use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice and your mailing address to send you your magazine. Similarly, if you enter online sweepstakes, we will use this information to notify you if you are a winner.

If you elect to customize the site, we collect your log-in, encrypted password, first and last name, email address, zip code, gender, birthdate, and income level. We will also give you the option to tell us your news preferences, favorite hobbies, whether you subscribe to the Express-News and how often you watch KENS-TV. We use this information to provide you with the customized news and features you have indicated you prefer.

We may also use information you provide to serve you ads, and, if you have given your consent for us to do so, to send you e-mails concerning offers from our partners and other third parties that we think may be of interest to you. 

When you conduct e-commerce with one of the e-commerce affiliates to which our site is linked, personal information such as your email and home address may be collected by the vendor's server and made available to us. We do not, however, collect your credit card information. We may use the information provided to us on an anonymous aggregated basis for purposes of analyzing traffic and usage.

**Disclosure of Personal Information:**  
MySA and its Partners may share or disclose personally identifiable information about you to other companies or individuals other than our partners when:

\- We have your consent to share the information;   
\- We need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested;   
\- We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of MySA and its Partners to provide a product or service to you. (Unless otherwise stated, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us);   
\- We comply with subpoenas or court orders, or need to collect a debt of money you may owe us:  
\- The entity to whom the information is disclosed is one under control of, or under common control with MySA or its partners (for these purposes, a company controlling twenty (20%) percent or more of the voting stock of another entity shall be deemed to control such entity); or  
\- The disclosure is made in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange, or other disposition (whether of assets, stock, or otherwise) of all or a portion of the business conducted by the web sites to which this policy applies. 

**Children:**  
The sites covered by this policy are not intended for use by children, especially those under age 13. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information or use our public discussion areas, forums and chats. MySA does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

**Security:**  
The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with users is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, MySA can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. 

**Choice/Opt-Out:**  
To keep you in control of communications directed to you, we allow you to opt-out of the following services: receiving communications from MySA and its Partners about new features or services, and receiving communications about offers from third-party companies that offer a product or service that we think would be of value to you. 

**Correct/Update:**  
MySA gives users the option of changing and/or modifying information previously provided. 

**Non-US Users:**  
If you are located outside of the United States, please note that the information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States. By using this web site, you consent to this transfer.

**Changes to Privacy Policy:**  
MySA may change this policy from time to time in its discretion. Your continued use of our sites indicates your consent to this privacy policy and any amended versions of it.

This policy was last updated on October 25, 2002.
