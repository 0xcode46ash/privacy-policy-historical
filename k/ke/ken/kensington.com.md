# Privacy Policy - Kensington

We respect your privacy and personal data.

ACCO Brands and its subsidiaries respect your privacy.  This policy identifies the ways in which we collect your data, what we will do with the data collected and your choices relating to our collection and use of your data.

This policy is available on all of our websites via a link on all web pages, commonly at the bottom of the screen.

We take privacy very seriously and in compiling this policy we have taken steps to ensure we have taken into account the standards and principles outlined in data collection and privacy frameworks around the world.

We also apply the principles of the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor framework:

  * Notice (we tell you what we are collecting and when we are collecting it)
  * Choice (we give you the choice to not have data collected about you)
  * Onward Transfer (we explicitly state how  and where we will transfer your data)
  * Access and Accuracy (we will provide you with the ability to monitor the accuracy of your data)
  * Security (we will keep all of your data as if it is our own - securely)
  * Oversight/Enforcement (if we fail in any of these respects we will abide by any enforcement measures)



More information about the U.S. Department of Commerce Safe Harbor Program can be found at <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>

**1\. Sites covered**

ACCO Brands is a global organization, with legal entities, business processes, management structures, and technical systems across the globe. This Privacy policy applies to all ACCO Brands owned websites and domains and the websites and domains of our wholly owned subsidiaries ("web site"), except in cases where a privacy policy or statement is available on one of the above mentioned websites that differs from this policy in which case the former will apply

**2\. Links to external websites and services**

Our websites may link to 3rd party web sites and services. These links are not endorsements of these sites and this policy does not extend to them. Because this policy is not enforced on these third party websites we would encourage you to read the privacy policy of the web site before using the service or site and providing any personal data.

**3\. Online shopping facilities**

In some cases we will partner with a third party service provider to facilitate our online shopping services. The information collected during your shopping experience is in some cases owned by the third party operating the online shopping facility. In these cases their privacy policy will be in force and we encourage you to make yourself aware of it in advance of placing an order. These third parties will usually share information with us about your transaction and we will store this.

In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and order fulfilment are handled by established third party banking, process agents and distribution institutions. They receive the information they need to verify and authorize your credit card transactions and to ship your order. When collecting credit card information for online purchases, we offer secured-server transactions that encrypt your information in transit to thwart someone from intercepting it and misusing it.

**4\. Collection of data and personal information**

To ensure that we provide you with the best possible experience we will store, use and share data about you in accordance with this policy and the relevant registrations with data protection authorities.

For example, when you request information, subscribe to our eMails or ask for support materials, register yourself or your ACCO Brands products, enter competitions or participate in surveys, or apply for a job at ACCO Brands, we will ask you to provide personal information to complete these transactions.

The sort of information that you provide in each case will vary and could include personal details such as your name, age and address. In some cases you will also provide profiling information such as your preferences or product choices. In some cases we will ask you for a username and password that should only be known to you.

In addition to the information that you provide to us we may also collect data about you during your visit to our website or whilst you engage with one of our marketing campaigns. We collect this data using automated tools that are detailed below. These tools collect data about your behaviour and your computer system. Information like your Internet address (IP Address), the pages you have looked at and the things you have done whilst on our web sites.

We may also use these tools on our eMail marketing campaigns to allow us to understand what links you click on and what content is of interest to you.

ACCO Brands may also collect data form commercial sources to enrich and verify the data that you have provided or that we have collected about you. This data will help us to ensure we have accurate records and will provide us with the ability to keep your information up to date. In some cases we may use this commercial data to work out something about you. For example we may use your IP address to calculate your approximate geographic location.

**a. Cookies**

A “cookie” is a small data file transmitted form a website to your computer’s hard drive. ACCO Brands will use cookies on our websites to provide you with services and features. For example we will use cookies to help you login to your account and provide a personalised experience. We will also use cookies to connect your activity together across multiple visits. In some cases we will also use cookies to monitor your interaction with our advertising campaigns; these cookies will be delivered by a third party website but will provide us with information when you visit our web site.

Cookies are usually defined in one of two ways and ACCO Brands sites use both of them: 

Session cookies do not stay on your computer after you close your browser.

Persistent cookies remain on your computer until you delete them or they expire. Most browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but you can usually refuse cookies or selectively accept cookies by adjusting the preferences in your browser.

The following browsers have online guides to cookies at the following links:

Microsoft Internet Explorer: <http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm>  
Mozilla Firefox: <http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/psm/help_21/using_priv_help.html>

Please be aware that a number of features on our site require cookies to operate correctly – turning off cookies will affect your experience on our website.

**b. Web beacons**

A Web beacon is an electronic image. Web beacons can track certain things form your computer and can report activity back to a web server allowing us to understand some of your behaviour.

If you choose to receive emails form ACCO Brands we will use web beacons to track your reaction to our emails. We will also use them to track if you click on the links and at what time and date you do so. Some of our marketing partners will use web beacons to track your interaction with online advertising banners.

**c. Embedded Web links**

Links provided in our emails and in some cases on 3rd party websites may include tracking embedded in the link. The tracking is accomplished through a redirection system. The redirection system allows ACCO Brands to understand how the link is being used.

Some of these links will enable ACCO brands to identify that you have personally clicked on the link and this may be attached to the personal data that we hold about you. This data is used to improve our service to you and to help us understand the performance of our marketing campaigns.

**d. Third-party websites and services**

ACCO Brands works with a number of service providers of marketing communications technology. These service providers may use various data collection methods to improve the performance of the marketing campaigns we are contracting them to provide. The Data collected can be gathered on our websites and also on the websites where our marketing communications are appearing. For example we may collect data where our banner adverts are displayed on third party websites.

**5\. Social Media**

We provide features on our web sites that allow you to share and connect through social networks. These features are connecting with the services provided by the social networks and therefore the privacy controls in place are those of the social networks. Before engaging with any of these tools we would encourage you to be aware of the privacy settings of your social profiles and also to read the privacy policies of the networks in question. These social features will often store information about you and the things that you share or comment upon.

If you share any of your personal information through a public forum or social network enabled feature on our web sites this information could be read by any one. ACCO Brands is therefore not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums.

**6\. How we use your information**

All of the information that we gather and that you provide is aimed at improving our service to you and your experience when engaging with our brands. For example we may use your information to:

  * prevent malicious activity and provide you with a secure experience;
  * provide service and support for products that you own;
  * provide marketing communications that are effective and optimised for you;
  * keep you up to date with the latest benefits available from us;
  * avoid sending you something that will not be of interest;
  * define what content you might be interested in;
  * personalize our websites to you;
  * measure performance of marketing programmes;
  * invite you to participate in competitions;
  * to learn about your behaviour and try to improve what we do for your benefit;
  * contact you about services and offers that are relevant to you;



Where we display testimonials, reviews or recommendations on our web site they have been placed there with the express consent of the owner of the statement.

**7\. How we share your information**

ACCO Brands will never sell or lease your information to any third party. We may disclose your personal information to our partners in accordance with this policy. We will share your information in the following ways:

ACCO Brands works with a number of suppliers internationally that help us to process your requests, deliver customer service and support, send our email marketing communications and provide the experience that you have come to expect form our brands. We will share your information with these suppliers in order to fulfil the service that they provide to us. They are under contract to keep your data secure and not to use it for any reason other than to fulfil the service we have requested from them.

On occasion we may provide you with the ability to communicate with selected third parties. Where this is the case we will provide you with the facility to instruct us to share your data with the selected third party. We will only ever share your data in this way if you have told us that you are willing to allow us to do so.

ACCO Brands requires that all users of our web sites and marketing campaigns allow us to share information with our subsidiaries and global legal entities. As a global organisation we have systems and process in countries around the globe and therefore need to be able to process your information globally to fulfil your requests for service and deliver the experience that you have asked for. This sharing is required as a condition of you providing us with information.

Except as describe in this policy we will not share your data with third parties unless it is under one of the following circumstances

(i) respond to duly authorized information requests of police and governmental authorities;  
(ii) comply with any law, regulation, subpoena, or court order;  
(iii) investigate and help prevent security threats, fraud or other malicious activity;  
(iv) enforce/protect the rights and properties of ACCO Brands or its subsidiaries; or  
(v) protect the rights or personal safety of ACCO Brands employees 

There are circumstances where ACCO Brands may decide to buy, sell or reorganise business in selected countries. Under these circumstances it may be necessary to share or receive personal information with prospective or actual partners. In these cases ACCO Brands will seek to ensure that all data remains protected by a policy of this nature.

**8\. Children's privacy**

ACCO Brands does not actively seek to gather data from Children. We do not target our products or services at children and would not expect them to be engaging with our web sites or services. We would encourage parents and guardians to provide adequate protection measures to prevent children from providing information unwillingly on the internet. If we are aware of any data that we have collected about children we will endeavour to delete it.

**9\. Your choices and selecting your privacy preferences**

ACCO Brands wants to provide you with relevant information that you have requested. 

You can make choices about the subscription based services we provide at the point of data collection or at anytime after you have received a communication form us or whilst you are subscribed to a service. This assumes that any transactional or service oriented messages are excluded form your preference as they are not intended to be for the purposes of marketing communications and rather to fulfil a service you have requested.

The communication that you receive form ACCO Brands will be in accordance with your preferences and this policy. Some of the communications you receive could include automatic data collection tools.

**a. Subscription eMail communications**

ACCO Brands provides the ability for you to subscribe to receive eMail newsletters that are expressly requested by you or which you consented to receive. 

After you request to receive these emails, you may opt out of receiving them by selecting the “Change preferences” or "unsubscribe" link, or follow the opt-out instructions included in each email communication.

Please note that by opting out you may affect other services which you have requested we provide to you where eMail communication is a requirement of the service provided.

**10\. Access to and accuracy of your information**

ACCO Brands strives to keep data accurately. We have processes in place to ensure that we keep all of our data in accordance with relevant frameworks and take steps to monitor accuracy. We employ technologies that will try to maintain data accuracy on input and processing to help us achieve this aim.

Where we enable you access to your private data we will always ask you for a username and password to help protect your privacy and security. We recommend that you keep your password safe and do not disclose it to any third party.

To view and change the personal information that you directly provided to ACCO Brands you can return to the Web page where you originally submitted your data and follow the instructions on that Web page or contact us directly for assistance.

**11\. Keeping your personal information secure**

ACCO Brands will use appropriate physical, technical and administrative procedures to safeguard the information that we collect to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure.

When we collect or transmit information over the internet we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. All of our data is stored in secure facilities with limited access and stringent security procedures.

**12\. Changes to this statement**

If we make any changes to this policy they will be posted on this page. You can get to this page from any of the Web sites that this policy applies to by clicking on the privacy policy link (usually at the bottom of the screen) We will always date these changes so you know if you are looking at a changed version.
