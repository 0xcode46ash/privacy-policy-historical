# Privacy Policy | Ketto.org

### 1.Introduction

We at Ketto respect your right to privacy and we comply with our obligations under the relevant Irish legislation, the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to outline how we deal with any personal data you provide to us while using this website. Naturally, if you are not happy with this Privacy Policy, you should not use this website. By visiting this website, you are accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy. Any external links to other websites are clearly identifiable as such, and we are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of these other websites. This Privacy Policy is a preliminary version and is subject to change.

### 2.Types of Information Collected

We retain two types of information:

#### "Personal Data"

This is data that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you and may include your first and last name, email address, country of residence, date of birth and gender. Such information is collected from you only if you voluntarily submit it to us. Of this information, only your first and last name, gender and country of residence are publicly available to all members of the Ketto community. Other information including, but not limited to, personal preferences, interests, occupation and education may also be provided and/or posted on the website by you at your discretion. You can control access to your pages and with whom you share information by using our privacy settings. To invite friends to connect with you on Ketto, we will ask you for their email addresses. The email addresses of people that you invite will be used only to send a one-time email inviting them to visit the website. Ketto stores this information only to send this one-time email, and to register new users if your invitations are accepted. Your friends may request that we delete this information from our database by emailing [info@ketto.org](mailto:info@ketto.org) Ketto may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by us. You may opt out of such email notifications. Even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications, Ketto reserves the right to notify you about your account. If you make a donation through Ketto, we require your email address to send you confirmation of the status of the payment. Please note that we display your email address - as well as your name and country - to the nonprofit organization that benefits from your donation. If you do not wish these details to be visible to a nonprofit organization, please select the "Anonymous" option when making your donation. Similarly, if you donate to a fundraiser, we display your name and country (but not your email address) to the moderator of the fundraiser that benefits from your donation. If you do not wish these details to be visible to a moderator of a fundraiser, please select the "Anonymous" option when making your donation. As part of the Ketto Services, Ketto's nonprofit members are required to provide certain information to Ketto. Of this information, only the nonprofit name, country and public e-mail must be displayed on this website. Other information such as the nonprofit member's alias, "strapline" (i.e. the nonprofit member's mission statement or nonprofit objectives), website, address and nonprofit number can be provided at the discretion of the nonprofit member, but if such information is provided, it must be displayed on the website.

#### "Non-Personal Data"

We gather statistical and other analytical information collected on an aggregate basis of all visitors to our website. This Non-Personal Data comprises information that cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information regarding, for example, clipped or anonymized user IP addresses, browser types and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our website.

### 3.Purposes for which We Hold your Information

####  "Personal Data"

  * We will process any personal data you provide to us for the following purposes:
  * (a) to respond to any queries you submit to us;
  * (b) to provide you with information on services offered by us; and
  * (c) to seek your views on our site and our services



#### "Non-Personal Data"

  * We use the non-personal data gathered from visitors to our website in an aggregate form to get a better understanding of where our visitors come from and to help us better design and organize our website.



### 4.Cookies

A cookie is a little piece of text stored by the browser on your computer, at the request of our server. Ketto makes use of cookies purely to facilitate a better experience. Our cookies only contain the identity of users and the last time they entered a password. You are always free to decline such cookies, if your browser permits, or to ask your browser to indicate when a cookie is being sent. You can also delete cookie files from your computer at your discretion.

### 5.Disclosure of Information to Third Parties

We will not disclose your Personal Data to third parties unless you have consented to this disclosure or unless the third party is required for the Ketto Services. (In such circumstances, the third party is bound by similar data protection requirements.)

We will disclose your Personal Data if we believe in good faith that we are required to disclose it in order: (a) to comply with any applicable law, a summons, a search warrant, a court or regulatory order or other statutory or legal requirement; (b) to enforce the Ketto Terms & Conditions or to protect our rights; or (c) to protect the safety of users of the Ketto website.

We will never disclose the Personal Data of your contacts to any third party, whether or not you choose to upload your contact details to the website.

We may provide Non-Personal Data to third parties, where such information is combined with similar information of other users of our website. For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit our website, the demographic breakdown of our community users of our website, or the activities that visitors to our website engage in while on our website. The third parties to whom we may provide this information may include, for example, potential or actual advertisers, providers of advertising services (including website tracking services), commercial partners, sponsors, licensees, researchers and other similar parties.

### 6.Sale of Business

We reserve the right to transfer information (including your Personal Data) to a third party in the event of a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of our company provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of the Privacy Policy and provided that the third party uses your Personal Data only for the purposes that you provided it to us. You will be notified in the event of any such transfer and you will be afforded an opportunity to opt-out.

### 7.Petitions

Ketto allows Nonprofit Members to create and display petitions on the Ketto website. The information requested and/or required from you for such petitions is determined by the Nonprofit Member who has created the petition and not by Ketto, and may include any or all of the following: your first and last name, title, street address, post code/zip code, town/city/region/state/province, country, email address and comment. You understand and agree that you are providing such information to the Nonprofit Member at your sole discretion and at your own risk. You understand and agree that Ketto does not accept any responsibility for any subsequent use of such information by the Nonprofit Member. If you are unhappy with providing any information that is requested and/or required by the Nonprofit Member for its petition, then you should not do so.

### 8.Security

Your Personal Data is held on secure servers hosted by our Internet service provider. The nature of the Internet is such that we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us via the Internet. No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. However, we will take all reasonable steps (including appropriate industry and technical protocols and standards) to protect your Personal Data. Ketto user accounts are secured by user-created passwords. In addition, Ketto takes all reasonable precautions to ensure that any information you provide which you have not chosen to make publicly available is kept private. To this end, Ketto restricts access to such user information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our technical staff.

### 9.Updating, Verifying and Deleting Personal Data

You may inform us of any changes in your Personal Data, and in accordance with our obligations under the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 we will update or delete your Personal Data accordingly. To find out what Personal Data we hold on you or to have your Personal Data updated, amended or removed from our database, please email it to us at [info@ketto.com](mailto:info@ketto.com). Any such data subject requests may be subject to the prescribed fee.

This Privacy Policy governs only information collected on this website. When linking to another website, a user should read the privacy policy stated on that website.

### 11.Changes to the Website Privacy Policy

Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted on this website so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any time we decide to use Personal Data in a manner significantly different from that stated in this Privacy Policy, or otherwise disclosed to you at the time it was collected, we will notify you by email, and you will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in the new manner.
