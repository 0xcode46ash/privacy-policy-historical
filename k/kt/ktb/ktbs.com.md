    ...Black Ice will remain a problem over all of the Ark-La-Tex
    This Afternoon through much of Wednesday...
    
    Widespread snowfall totals of one to three inches has fallen
    across much of the Ark La Tex this morning, with the snow expected
    to diminish across Deep East Texas and the southern sections of
    Northcentral Louisiana this afternoon. However, temperatures will
    remain below freezing this afternoon areawide, with the cloud
    cover expected to diminish along and south of the Interstate 20
    corridor by tonight. 
    
    The existing snowpack, clearing sky, and weakening winds will
    allow temperatures to quickly fall into teens and lower 20s this
    evening, and into the lower and middle teens areawide by 
    Wednesday morning. As a result, any melting snow on the roadways, 
    bridges, and overpasses this afternoon will quickly refreeze into
    black ice this evening, making travel very treacherous. 
    Temperatures will only warm slowly Wednesday, but will likely 
    remain below freezing until early to mid afternoon, if at all. 
    Thus, black ice on area roadways will remain a problem through 
    much of Wednesday, with this threat again increasing Wednesday 
    night as temperatures fall into the teens once again. 
    
    Travel is strongly discouraged across the region this afternoon
    through Wednesday. If you must travel this afternoon or tonight,
    please drive slowly, allow plenty of time to reach your
    destination, and allow extra space between you and the other 
    drivers around you. Be sure you pack a winter weather survival 
    kit, by including food, water, extra blankets, a flashlight, and 
    provide a means to charge your cell phone or other electronic 
    devices in case you are stranded. Be sure you have a full tank of 
    gas before leaving as well.
