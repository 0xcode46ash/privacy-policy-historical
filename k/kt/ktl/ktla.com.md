# ktla.com | Station Information - Privacy Policy

Last Updated: October, 2000

ktla.com is dedicated to providing visitors to this site with a highly interactive and personalized experience, while at the same time protecting users from any unexpected use of personally identifiable information (your name, e-mail address, snail mail address, telephone number). Like other Web publishers, we collect information from users in order to deliver more individualized content and advertising, and we sometimes permit our advertising and promotional partners to call to your attention products, special offers and unique content we believe might be of interest to you. In each case, we do so only within the guidelines in this policy. Your use of our site tells us you have read and accept the practices outlined in this policy.

**How we gather information from users**

ktla.com gathers information you provide to us when you register for access to certain portions of our site. We also gather information you provide to us when you participate in interactive areas of our site, including sweepstakes and contests, voting and polling activities, message boards and chat rooms. Also, in connection with our current and planned electronic commerce services, you may be asked to provide information, including credit card information, necessary to complete a transaction you have requested. Some of the demographic information we request may be identified as "optional" during the registration process. 

ktla.com may also employ "cookie" technology to improve your navigation through the site and to allow customization of the site according to your individual preferences. The technology involves a string of information (the cookie) that is passed to your Web browser and stored on your computer. This cookie identifies you as a unique user and holds your preferences, as you have identified them, and other information from your visit. For example, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit and granting you certain access privileges.

Cookies may also be used to control the number of times you encounter particular advertisements while visiting our sites. You can set your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we will not be able to customize the site's features according to your preferences.

Like most Web sites, ktla.com also logs IP addresses (such as the name of your Internet Service Provider of browser), or the electronic location of your computer on the Internet.

**What we do with the information we collect**

The information you share with us may be used in several ways. Typically, during your visit to our sites, we will use your registration and demographic information to deliver targeted editorial or advertising content we think might interest you. 

We may also combine information about you, your computer, and your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to create profiles of ktla.com users as a whole and to identify their preferences in content and advertising. This aggregated information occasionally may be shared with our advertisers and business partners and may be used by Tribune Interactive, Inc., and other Tribune Company affiliates.

We may also use personally identifiable information to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policies; services and products offered by Tribune Interactive, Inc., and other Tribune Company affiliates; and other topics. For example, we may communicate with you from time to time about changes and improvements to ktla.com and about sweepstakes or promotions we are conducting.

From time to time we or our advertising and promotional partners may call to your attention products, special offers and unique content we believe might be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive direct communications from our advertisers or promotional partners, you will be given an opportunity to decline before you provide us any information we might use for this purpose. If you decline each time you provide us with the information, you will not receive e-mail or other communications directly from our advertisers utilizing information collected from our site.

Personal information collected by ktla.com may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to: site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. We will also disclose such information in response to a court order and when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law. Please note that we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.

**Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements**

Through ktla.com, you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. ktla.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates, and other content providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. During your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame that includes ktla.com content, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. ktla.com is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. Users should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing personally identifiable information on a co-branded, affiliated, framed or linked site, or on a site hosted by a third party.

While on our site, you may occasionally receive cookies from advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties whose information is displayed on our site. The placement of cookies by third-party servers is common on the Internet. ktla.com does not control the use of these cookies or the resulting information; therefore, the information collected by these cookies is not subject to ktla.com's privacy policy. 

Finally, you should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address, or other messages) on message boards or in chat areas of ktla.com, that information can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of ktla.com.

**Children**

ktla.com does not knowingly collect or solicit personally-identifiable information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If we discover that we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately.
