**Effect of Policy**

This policy does not form a contract between KTMB and an individual. The policy may also be subject to change. Whenever a user needs to refer to this policy the user should contact KTMB for the most up to date version.

**

Concerns, Correction and Access

**

If a user has concerns about how KTMB is handling the user’s personal information or if a user believes that information KTMB holds about the user is incorrect, then KTMB requests that the user contact KTMB and KTMB will try to resolve those concerns. In some cases, KTMB may not be able to give the user access to personal information it holds on the user if making such a disclosure would breach KTMB’s legal obligations to its customer.

Concerns, access requests or questions should be directed in writing to the Information Technology Department, Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad, KTMB Corporate Headquarters, Jalan Sultan Hishamuddin, 50621 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia or by email at [webmaster@ktmb.com.my](mailto:webmaster@ktmb.com.my)

In some cases, KTMB may request an administrative fee to cover the cost of access.  


 **

Security of Personal Information

**

KTMB aims to achieve best industry practice in maintaining the security of personal information it holds. Where possible, documents or work product retained are de-identified. Otherwise, it is KTMB’s policy to destroy personal information once there is no longer a business or legal need for KTMB to retain it.

**

Overseas Transfers

**

KTMB will only transfer the user’s personal information overseas where:

  * the user would be likely to give consent if KTMB were able to contact the user, the transfer is for the user’s benefit and it is impracticable for KTMB to obtain the user’s consent; or
  * the user has requested the transfer or consented for KTMB to do so; or
  * KTMB is satisfied that the recipient is subject to effective data protection standards. 

**

Disclosure and Use

**

KTMB will only disclose or use the user’s personal information for the purpose it was collected unless:

  * KTMB is compelled by law or otherwise required to disclose such information; 
  * the disclosure/use is related to the purpose of collection and the user would reasonably expect KTMB to disclose or use it in such a way; or
  * the user has impliedly or expressly consented to its disclosure or use. 



  
KTMB has procedures and controls to ensure that personal information provided to KTMB remains confidential. KTMB’s staff has professional duties of confidentiality to the customers and the company. KTMB is also subject to professional standards of fairness and honesty as to the way KTMB conducts its business. KTMB does not allow third parties to use personal information for their own purposes, or trade or sell that personal information. 

**

Collection of Personal Information

**

KTMB only collects personal information where there is a legal requirement for it to do so or if it is necessary for KTMB’s business purposes. 

KTMB will take reasonable steps to ensure that the user knows how the user can access the user’s personal information to ensure it is up to date and accurate, to whom KTMB may disclose it, what KTMB uses it for and why KTMB is collecting the user’s personal information. 

There are some circumstances where it is not practicable or reasonable for KTMB to let the user know this information. For example, it is KTMB’s practice not to disclose such information to an individual if doing so would:

  * undermine the purpose for which the information is being collected (where collection is for a legitimate business practice); or
  * breach KTMB’s legal and professional obligation to KTMB’s customers; or
  * where KTMB collects information from public records.

KTMB believes that privacy is important to the businesses of KTMB’s customers and its own business and is an important individual right. This policy sets out KTMB’s commitment to maintain information handling standards.
