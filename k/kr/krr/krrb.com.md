This policy describes the ways we collect, store, use and protect your personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") and other data that Krrb gathers (“non-Personal Information”) when you are accessing our Service. All capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use/).

## Collection of Information

The types of Personal Information collected may include your name, email address, physical address(es), phone number, birthday, Twitter and/or Facebook usernames, and any other information you may enter into your account settings or provide during your use of the Service.

## Use of Information

### How We Use Your Information

The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as allowing you to use the Service including, but not limited to, setting up your User account and profile that can be used to process transactions and interact with other Users through the Service. We may draw upon Personal Information and non-Personal Information and other server usage information to analyze User behavior in order to improve the Service, customize the advertising and content you see, communicate with you about the Service, troubleshoot technical problems, resolve disputes, address complaints and generate reports of aggregated non-Personal Information and activity that we may share with others.

### Public Display of Information

Personal Information about our Users is a central part of our business. One of the primary reasons people use Krrb is to connect with trusted individuals and businesses. In order to build trust, certain Personal Information is shared publicly. Krrb may share your Personal Information only as described below.

  * **Profile:** Any information you add to your “About Me” and “Corner” settings will be displayed publicly, including information automatically added from Facebook or Twitter.  You can edit or remove any of this information in your account settings.
  * **Activity:** By default, your activity will display publicly including your posts, generalized locations and people you follow. You may choose to publicly display other information. This option can be managed in your account settings. 
  * **Locations:** By default, your exact address is concealed and will never be shared publicly or privately. Instead, a small radius around you is displayed with the exact center-point randomly displaced for further privacy. You may choose to display publicly your exact location, which we do not recommend unless you are a business. 
  * **Stats and Verifications:** In order to help you build trust with other Users, your stats and verifications will be displayed on your posts and corner, including join date, city and country from which you last signed in, account certification, email verification, number of Facebook friends, number of Twitter followers, number of member referrals, number of posts published, number of posts closed, number of conversations, response rate and average response time. Other stats and verifications may be added at any time. You do not have the ability to hide your stats and verifications. 
  * **Closed Listings:** By default, your closed listings will display publicly. You can disable this feature in your account settings.
  * **Email Address:** Your email address is kept private and it is a violation of our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use/) to share it publicly or privately.



### How Long We Keep Your Information

Following termination or deactivation of your account, or if you remove any data from our Service, we may retain your User Information and/or User Content for a commercially reasonable period of time for backup, archival, or audit purposes. Furthermore, Krrb and its Users may retain and continue to use, store, display, reproduce, modify, create derivative works, perform, and distribute any of your User Content that other Users have stored or shared through our Service.

### Information Changes or Removal

To the extent you are able to modify or delete information as defined in this Privacy Policy, it will usually be changed or removed immediately, but in some cases, such as cached content, the update will take time, and some or all information may remain indefinitely in our database. Even after you remove information from your account or profile, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere, to the extent it has been indexed by search engines, shared with others, copied or stored by other Users, or it was otherwise distributed as defined in this Privacy Policy.

## Disclosure of Information

We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. Krrb may share your Personal and non-Personal Information only as described below.

  * **Our Corporate Family:** We may share your information with any parent company, subsidiary, joint venture, other entity under a common control with Krrb or with third party acquirers, including, but not limited to, Area 17 Media, LLC, a New York limited liability company, and its French affiliate Area 17, S.A.R.L.
  * **Our Agents:** We employ other companies, organizations, people (including outside of your country of residence) to perform tasks (e.g. fraud and spam protection) on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide our Service to you. Our agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us, and they are required to provide a comparable level of protection for your Personal Information.
  * **Business Transfers:** If Krrb or substantially all of its assets are acquired, or in the unlikely event that Krrb goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, User information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
  * **Law Enforcement:** In accordance with our [Law Enforcement Policy](https://web.archive.org/law-enforcement/), we may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to (1) comply with the law, including laws outside your country of residence; (2) enforce or apply our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use/) and other agreements; or (3) protect the rights, property or safety of Krrb, our employees, our Users, or others.
  * **Our Partners:** In addition to the data-sharing described above, we enter into relationships with a variety of companies, organizations and people and work closely with them. We may provide aggregate non-Personal Information and activity to our partners about how our Users, collectively, use our Service. If you register through a Krrb partner site or joint initiative, we might share your Personal Information and non-Personal Information with that partner, in which case your data is also governed by that entity's privacy policies, in addition to ours.

## Cookies and Similar Technologies

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website, krrb.com, and other websites we power (the “Site”) are visited and by how many people. Krrb cookies do not collect Personal Information.

Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. If you refuse cookies, you will not be able to use our Service.

Ads appearing on the Service may be delivered to Users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time it sends you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Krrb and its service providers and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. You may opt out of advertiser cookies and continue to use our Service.

Krrb uses analytics software to better understand who is using our Service, and how people are using it. Analytics software uses cookies to collect and store anonymous information such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the Site, IP address, and type of operating system used. We use this information to improve the Service and make it appealing to as many Users as possible.

## Payment Security and PCI Compliance

Security is one of the biggest considerations in everything we do. When using [Krrb Payments](https://web.archive.org/payments-terms-of-use), social security and tax ID numbers, credit card and bank account numbers are securely encrypted, transmitted to and stored with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), our payment processor. Absolutely no credit card, bank account, social security and tax ID numbers are stored on our servers nor do we have access to the un-encrypted data. Stripe has been audited by a PCI-certified auditor, and is certified to [PCI Service Provider Level 1](http://www.visa.com/splisting/searchGrsp.do?companyNameCriteria=stripe). This is the most stringent level of certification available. Any other sensitive data that is stored on our servers is securely encrypted.

Any developer that does not follow our policies may have their API access revoked at any time. The use of third party apps developed using our API may be subject to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policies of such third party developers. Certain Personal Information may be made available to third party developers if you use these third party apps. You should review the policies of third party apps to ensure that you are comfortable with the ways in which they use the information you share with them. 

## International Users

As a result, United States federal and state governments, courts, or law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through laws applicable in the United States. Your use of our Service or your submission of any Personal Information to us will constitute your consent to the transfer of your Personal Information outside of your home country, including to the United States, which may provide for different data protection rules than in your country.
