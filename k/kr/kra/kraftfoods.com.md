# KRAFT Privacy Policy

This website is owned and operated by Kraft Foods, Inc. Here at Kraft, we recognize that many visitors to our site are concerned about the information they provide to us, and how we treat that information. So we've developed a Privacy Policy to address those concerns. We may update the Policy from time to time, so please check in occasionally. 

**Information We Collect and What We Do With It**

At our site, we don't collect personally-identifiable information from individuals unless they provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. This means we don't require you to register or provide information to us in order to view our site. If you register in order to use the "Recipe Box," "Simple Meal-Planner," or "Recipes By E-Mail" features of our site, we use the information you supply for the purpose of providing the services you've requested. If you specifically agreed to follow-up contacts by us or asked to be put on our mailing list when you registered, we may also contact you from time to time. You can always change your preference for follow-up contacts just by e-mailing the Online Team at the address listed below. We don't share any information you give us with anyone outside of Kraft Foods. 

In the e-mail section of our site, we ask for some personally-identifiable information, such as your name and phone number. We use this information only if we need to contact you directly because our attempts to contact you by e-mail were unsuccessful. We don't use the information internally for other purposes, and we don't share it with anyone outside of Kraft Foods. We don't use your e-mail address for any purpose other than responding to the message you've sent, unless we have your permission. Our site sometimes includes notices of sweepstakes or other promotions we are conducting, and we may permit you to enter electronically in some cases. If that occurs, we will use the information you provide for the purpose of conducting the promotion (e.g., to contact you if you're a winner). We don't share the information you give us with anyone outside of Kraft Foods. 

**Important Note to Kids**

Before providing your name, address, email address, or any other personal information to anyone on the Internet, be sure to ask your parents if it's ok. 

**Important Note to Parents**

The portions of our website that are dedicated to the Oscar Mayer and Lunchables brands are directed in whole or in part to kids under 13. At the present time, we do not knowingly collect personally-identifiable information from kids under 13 in these areas, except as described below. 

We do sometimes offer promotions in these areas of our website, such as a sweepstakes or contest. In those cases, we permit the child to enter by submitting a first name and e-mail address only, along with the name and e-mail address of his/her parent. We then notify the parent about the child's entry, and offer the parent an opportunity to withdraw the entry and remove the submitted information from our operational database. If the parent permits the child's participation in the promotion and the child wins, we contact the parent (not the child) for further personal information needed for any prize delivery. We do not use the child's personal information for any purpose other than completion of the promotion, and we do not share the information with any third parties unless we've explicitly said so in the notice to parents. We delete both the child's and the parent's personal information from our operational database within a reasonable time after the conclusion of these promotions. 

We may permit a child to send us an e-mail, or to send a friend an e-mail through our site. We will respond to or deliver the e-mail, but we do not store the names, addresses, or the e-mails in our operational database. We do not maintain this information and we do not share it with any third parties. 

Under federal law, websites directed to children under 13 are prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an activity on the child's disclosing more information than is reasonably necessary. We comply fully with this requirement. 

Upon proper identification, any parent can review any personal information we have collected from their child, if we are still maintaining the information in our operational database. They may also have the information deleted from the database, and refuse to permit further collection or use of their child's information. If you are a parent and wish to exercise these rights, please contact the Online Team as described below. 

**Cookies**

Like many companies, we use "cookie" technology on our web site. We use a temporary session cookie to enable you to use our shopping list and play some of our games. These temporary cookies are eliminated when you exit your browser. Another type of cookie can be stored on your computer by your browser. When you log in, this type of cookie tells us whether you've visited us before or are a new visitor. The cookie doesn't obtain any personal information about you or provide us with any way to contact you, and the cookie doesn't extract any information from your computer. We do use the cookie to help us identify site features and recipes in which you have the greatest interest, so that we can provide more of what you may want.
