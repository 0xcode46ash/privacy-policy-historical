**_Information We Collect_**  
---  
|   
**_Personally-Identifiable Information_**  
|   
On our website, we collect certain personally-identifiable information about our online visitors. Personally-identifiable information relates to an individual consumer - for example, name, address, telephone number and e-mail address. You may provide personally-identifiable information, for example, by entering a promotion. We don’t require you to provide personally-identifiable information to view our site or play our games. Here are the ways we collect personally-identifiable information.  
|   
**_Registration_**  
|   
To take full advantage of all our offerings, you may choose to register on our site. In the registration process, we request that you provide a user name. We ask you to avoid using your actual name as your user name. All user names are maintained in our database so visitors can use the special features on our site.  
|   
**_Contests, Sweepstakes and Games_**  
|   
Our site contains notices of contests, sweepstakes and games we are conducting, which you may enter electronically in some cases. We use the information you provide to conduct the promotion (for example, to contact you if you’re a winner). We won’t use the information you provide to enter the promotion for any other purpose unless you’ve agreed otherwise.  
|   
**_"Contact Us" Link_**  
|   
If you e-mail us through the “Contact Us” link on this site, we ask you for information such as your first name and e-mail address so we can respond to your questions and comments. You may choose to provide additional information as well.  
|   
**_Tell A Friend_**  
|   
We may give you the opportunity to tell your friends about our games and send your friends activities you’ve created on our site. If you take advantage of these features, we may ask you for your friend’s and your first name and e-mail address. We use the information you provide only to send the e-mail you requested we forward.  
|   
**_Other Site Features_**  
|   
We may offer visitors to our website various features for their enjoyment, which we may change from time to time. We may ask you to submit certain personally-identifiable information so we can provide you with these features.  
|   
**_Aggregate and Non-Personal Information_**  
|   
We collect certain aggregate and non-personal information when you visit our website. Aggregate and non-personal information does not relate to a single, identifiable visitor. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our website to our visitors.  
|   
**_Cookies_**  
|   
Like many companies, we use “cookies” on our website. Cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer’s hard drive when you visit certain websites. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site. 

When you visit our website, cookies are placed on your computer. We use cookies to tell us, for example, whether you’ve visited us before or if you’re a new visitor and to help us identify site features in which you may have the greatest interest. We collect this information to enhance your experience on our website.

The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. Remember, though, without cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of all of our website features.  
  
|   
**_Web Beacons_**  
|   
Certain pages on our site may contain “web beacons” (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). These web beacons allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the third party.  
|   
**_Questionnaires and Surveys_**  
|   
We occasionally ask visitors to our website to complete online surveys and opinion polls about their activities, attitudes and interests. These surveys help us understand the needs of our visitors. We do not ask for any personally-identifiable information about you in connection with your participation in a website survey.  
  
**_How We Use Personally-Identifiable Information_**  
  
We may use the information you provide to contact you from time to time. For example, we may (i) send you promotional materials and other communications you request, (ii) respond to your comments or questions, or (iii) contact you if needed while processing a product or service you requested through our website.  
  
**_How We Share Personally-Identifiable Information_**  
  
Except as described below, we don’t sell, transfer or otherwise disclose to third parties the personally-identifiable information we collect on this website without your prior consent. We disclose information where we think it’s necessary to investigate or prevent an actual or suspected crime or injury to ourselves or others or where disclosure is required by law. We also may disclose information in response to a request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials. We also disclose information to third parties we retain to perform services on our behalf. For example, we hire service providers to help us run promotions, fulfill orders you may place and provide customer service. These service providers may have access to personally-identifiable information about our website visitors if it is needed to perform their functions for Kraft, but they are not authorized by Kraft to use the information for their own marketing purposes.

On our website, we may conduct joint promotions with other companies. We may share with our promotional partners (and their service providers) certain personally-identifiable information as necessary to conduct the promotion. We will not share this information with our promotional partners for any other purpose unless you tell us it’s ok to do so.

We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use personal information provided through this website in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice.  
  
  
**_Links To Other Websites_**  
  
This website may contain links to other websites. We provide these links solely for your convenience and information. Different websites have different privacy practices. You should always check the privacy notice of the specific site you’re visiting to understand the privacy practices associated with that site.  
  
**_Children’s Privacy_**  
  
This website may appeal to kids under 13. Our conduct on the website is governed by federal law and regulations that address children’s online privacy, as well as by the guidelines of the Children’s Advertising Review Unit (CARU), a part of the Council of Better Business Bureaus.

We do not knowingly collect personally-identifiable information from kids under 13 on our website, except as permitted by legal requirements and the CARU guidelines. We sometimes offer promotions on our website, such as contests, sweepstakes and games. We may permit a child to enter certain promotions by submitting the parent’s e-mail address, and, sometimes, the child’s e-mail address as well. If the child wins, we contact the parent for further information needed for any prize delivery. Unless the parent has explicitly consented, we do not (i) use the child’s or the parent’s personal information for any purpose other than to complete the promotion or (ii) share the information with third parties except as described above in this Privacy Notice. We do not retain the child’s personally-identifiable information in our database unless the parent has given us permission to do so.

We permit children under the age of 13 to contact us through the website “Contact Us” link with questions or comments. We request only the child’s first name and e-mail address and use that information solely to respond directly to the child on a one-time basis. We do not use the information to recontact the child and we delete the child’s personal information from our database after responding to the child’s inquiry.

Upon proper identification, a parent may review any personal information we have collected from his or her child if we still have the information in our database. The parent also may request that the child’s information be deleted from our database and may refuse to permit further collection or use of the child’s information. If you are a parent and wish to exercise these rights, please contact us as described below.  
  
  
**_How We Protect Personally-Identifiable Information_**  
  
The security of personally-identifiable information is important to us. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized use, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the personally-identifiable information we collect on this website.  
  
**_Updates To This Privacy Notice_**  
  
We may change or update portions of this Privacy Notice at any time. Please check back from time to time so you are aware of any changes or updates to the notice. We will indicate the notice’s effective date on the first page of the notice.
