# Privacy Promise

Here at Kraft Canada, we recognize that many consumers are concerned about the personal information they provide to us and how we treat that information. That's why we've developed a Privacy Promise to address those concerns.

This Policy relates only to our online information collection and use practices.

**COLLECTION**  
At Kraft Canada, we sometimes collect personal information from consumers via direct mail, questionnaires, sweepstakes, contests, product packaging, in-store promotions, and through our web site. However, we will not collect such information from you unless you provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. This means we don't require you to provide such information in order to communicate with us.

**USE  
**At the time we collect your personal information we will explain how we will use it, and we will only use it for the stated purpose. If you specifically agree to follow-up contacts by us or asked to be put on our mailing list, we may also contact you from time to time.

**CHANGING INFORMATION**  
If you're registered and logged onto the site, you can always change your preference for follow-up contacts, or advise us of changes in your circumstances (such as address) just by [clicking here](http://www.kraftcanada.com/en/registration/myprofile.aspx) and editing your profile. If you're not registered on the site but receive communications from Kraft and wish to change your contact information, you can send us an email or write to us (see our contact details at top of page.)

**PROTECTION**  
We will not share any information you give us with anyone outside of Kraft except when required or permitted by law, and with those suppliers, or advertising and promotional agencies that need to have access to the information to provide the services you have requested. We protect your personal information with appropriate security measures, and we require our suppliers, and advertising and promotional agencies to do the same.

**INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH THIS WEBSITE**  
In the registration section of our web site, we ask for your name and other information which will enable us to provide you with new Kraft products and services, and deliver website content that is of interest to you. In the Ask Us/Email us section of the site, we ask for your name and other information in order to address your inquiry or respond appropriately.

**KIDS**  
Before providing your name, address, or email address to us, be sure to ask your parents if it's ok.

**COOKIES  
**Like many companies, we use "cookie" technology on our web site. We use a temporary session cookie to recognize you and greet you by name on your homepage, give you access to your recipe box, other "registered user" sections of the site, and your Edit Profile page. These temporary cookies are eliminated when you exit your browser. Another type of cookie can be stored on your computer by your browser. When you log in, this type of cookie tells us whether you've visited us before or are a new visitor. The cookie doesn't obtain any personal information about you or provide us with any way to contact you, and the cookie doesn't extract any information from your computer. We do use the cookie to help us identify site features and recipes in which you have the greatest interest, so that we can provide more of what you may want.
