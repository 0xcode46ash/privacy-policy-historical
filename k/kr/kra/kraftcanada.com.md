This Policy covers Kraft Canada’s collection and use of personal information obtained directly from consumers.

**COLLECTION**  
At Kraft Canada, we sometimes collect personal information from consumers via direct mail, questionnaires, sweepstakes, contests, product packaging, in-store promotions, magazines, by phone, and through our web sites or other on-line means. However, we will not collect such information from you unless you provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. This means we don't require you to provide such information in order to communicate with us.

**USE**  
At the time we collect your personal information we will explain how we will use it, and we will only use it for the stated purpose. If you specifically agree to follow-up contacts by us or asked to be put on our mailing list, we may also contact you from time to time.

**CHANGING INFORMATION**  
If you're registered and logged onto Kraftcanada.com , you can always change your preference for follow-up contacts, or advise us of changes in your circumstances (such as address) just by [clicking here](http://www.kraftcanada.com/en/registration/myprofile.aspx) and editing your profile. If you're not registered on the site but receive communications from Kraft and wish to change your contact information, you can send us an email or write to us (see our contact details at top of page).

**SECURITY**  
We will not share any information you give us with anyone outside of Kraft except when required or permitted by law, and with those suppliers, or advertising and promotional agencies that need to have access to the information to provide the services you have requested. We protect your personal information with appropriate security measures, and we require our suppliers, and advertising and promotional agencies to do the same. We will only keep your personal information for as long as it remains necessary for the purpose it was provided or as required by law. Then we will delete it.

Kraft Canada is part of the Kraft Foods global group of companies. Website hosting, storage and management of electronic communications, and data processing within the Kraft Foods group of companies may be done via servers located outside of Canada. Some of our supplier, advertising, or promotional agency service providers as described above may also be located outside of Canada. As a result, your personal information may be accessible to regulatory authorities in accordance with the laws of other jurisdictions, including without limitation, the United States _Patriot Act_.

In limited circumstances we may also transfer your information to potential buyers of all or a portion of any Kraft business or other assets. In that case, we will use contractual means to ensure the potential buyers promise to keep your information secure, and, if the sale or transfer proceeds, to only use the information for the purposes for which you disclosed it and in a manner consistent with this Privacy Promise.

**KIDS**  
Before providing your name, address, or email address to us, be sure to ask your parents if it's ok.

**CHILDREN’S ONLINE PRIVACY**  
Some portions of our websites are directed to children under 13, where we conduct sweepstakes, games, or other promotions (“Contests”). We may permit a child under 13 to enter a Contest by giving us a first name, age, email address, and any other information needed to conduct the Contest, along with the name, email address, or other contact information of the child’s parent or guardian. We then notify the parent or guardian about the child's entry, and offer the parent or guardian an opportunity to withdraw the entry and remove the information from our files. If the parent or guardian agrees to the child's participation in the Contest and the child wins, we will contact the parent or guardian for any further personal information needed for prize delivery. 

We do not use the child's personal information for any purpose other than completion of the Contest, and we do not share the information with others (except our supplier, advertising, or promotional agencies in connection with the administration of the Contest), unless we have the parent or guardian’s express consent. We do not make a child's participation in a Contest or any other online activity dependant on the child's disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary.   
We also might permit a child to send us an email, or to send an email to a friend through our site. We will respond to or deliver these emails, but we do not keep the names, email addresses, or the emails themselves, nor do we share them with others (except supplier, advertising, or promotional agencies as described above). 

Upon proper identification, any parent or guardian can review any personal information we have collected from his/her child. The parent or guardian may also ask that the information be deleted from our files, and may refuse to permit further collection or use of the child's information. If you are a parent and wish to exercise these rights you can send us an email or write to us (see our contact details at top of page). 

**COOKIES**  
Like many companies, we use "cookie" technology on our websites. We use a temporary session cookie to recognize you and greet you by name on your homepage, and give you access to your recipe box, other "registered user" sections of the site, and your Edit Profile page. These temporary cookies are eliminated when you exit your browser. Another type of cookie can be stored on your computer by your browser. When you log in, this type of cookie tells us whether you've visited us before or are a new visitor. The cookie doesn't obtain any personal information about you or provide us with any way to contact you, and the cookie doesn't extract any information from your computer. We do use the cookie to help us identify site features and recipes in which you have the greatest interest, so that we can provide more of what you may want. 

**THIRD PARTY LINKS**  
Our websites may include links to websites belonging to others. We have no control over these sites and cannot be responsible for how the owners of these sites may collect, use or disclose and otherwise treat your personal information. 

**REGISTRATION**  
Some Kraft websites may ask you if you wish to register with us so we can provide you with information about our products and services. In the registration section of our websites, we ask for your name and other information that will enable us to do this. In the Ask Us/Email us section of the site, we ask for your name and other information in order to address your inquiry or respond appropriately.
