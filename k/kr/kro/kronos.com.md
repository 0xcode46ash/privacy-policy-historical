#### Privacy Policy  |  [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use)  |  [Trademarks](https://web.archive.org/trademarks "Trademarks")

#### Introduction

Unless otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, this policy shall be deemed to apply to Kronos Incorporated and our affiliates, and all references to "we", "us" and/or "our" shall refer to Kronos Incorporated and those affiliates.

[Note: Because there are differences in the ways Kronos' Talent Management Division collects and uses Personal Information consistent with the services it provides to customers, Kronos has published a separate privacy statement that identifies those differences. Click here for the Privacy Statement that applies to the Kronos Talent Management Division only.]

**1) Personal Information We Collect**

We collect, process and/or store personally identifiable data ("Personal Information") from you and a number of sources, primarily to provide products and services to our customers (under contracts with them) and to improve those products and services.

Sometimes we collect such data directly from you when you provide contact and other information to us through a Kronos website (a "Site"), or when you ask us question, make a comment, request support, or use certain services. By voluntarily providing us with Personal Information, you consent to our use of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Information to us electronically, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Information may be transferred from your current location to offices and servers of ours located in the United States and other countries, consistent with applicable law.

We also may obtain such information by recording how you use our products, for example through error reports or other usage data. When you visit a Site, certain Personal Information may be collected by recording how you interact with that Site via cookies or web beacons (see Section 2 below for further details). If you participate in Kronos Community online discussions about our products and services, you may opt to register as a participant and provide us with a personal profile, a picture or other Personal Information.

Kronos, in delivering its workforce management products and services, also processes data provided by its customers about their employees in order to provide the full benefit of our products and services (see Section 3 below for further details). Such data is collected under instructions set forth in the contract between Kronos, as a data processor, and its customer.

We also collect Personal Information from Kronos job applicants and our employees for the purposes of conducting our human resources responsibilities, such as hiring and conducting employee performance evaluations, administering payroll and benefits (and related record keeping), filing government reports, company network management and authentication, security, and employee health and safety.

**2) Our Sites; Cookies and Similar Technologies**

When you utilize a Site, we may receive certain personally non-identifiable information about your use of the Site. We may store such information ourselves or it may be included in databases owned and maintained by us, our subcontractors, agents or our business partners. We may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for instance, the total number of visitors to a Site and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers.

Like most websites, we also collect and/or log specific Site visitor information, which may include both non-identifiable information and Personal Information, including what kind of browser visitors are on, what operating system they are using, their IP address, cookie information, time stamp and clickstream information. This data is collected through the use of log files, "cookies," "web beacon" or other similar technologies. "Cookies" are small files of data that may be sent to your web browser and stored on your computer. With "web beacons," when a visitor accesses certain pages on a Site, an anonymous notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us. Web beacons work in conjunction with cookies to let us know what portions of our Sites are of interest to you and to help us provide you with tailored information from our Sites. We may collect and store this information and combine it with other Personal Information you have provided. Most web browsers can be configured not to accept cookies, notify you if a cookie is sent to you, or otherwise manage cookies, web beacons and similar technologies. If you turn off cookies, web beacons and similar technologies will still detect anonymous visits, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other anonymous information or personally-identifiable information and are disregarded.

**3) Online Advertising and Research**

We also use first-party and third-party cookies in online advertising efforts. When you visit a Site, third parties may set cookies on your computer and use those cookies to collect information about you, including about your computer and how you use the Site. These parties use such information to personalize and deliver targeted advertising to you on non-Kronos websites. For additional information about online behavioral advertising, visit the websites of the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance. If you would like to prevent third parties from setting and accessing cookies and similar technologies on your computer for advertising and other purposes, you can configure your browser to manage or block cookies and those technologies.

Finally, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve all users of Kronos services, we may conduct research on user demographics and interests based on the Personal Information and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and we may share this aggregated data with our affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally.

**4) Do Not Track**

Like many websites, our Sites do not currently respond to "do not track" browser headers. But, you can take steps to limit tracking by erasing cookies and similar technologies from your computer's hard drive and by setting your browser to block all cookies or similar technologies or warn you before they are stored.

**5) How We Use Data**

We will use the Personal Information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.

When you visit our Sites, we may use the data in the manner described in Section 2 above. You can use many features of our Sites without providing any Personal Information, however, you may not be able to use certain services.

If you provide Personal Information to us directly in another manner and for a specified reason, we may use the Personal Information in connection with the reason for which it was provided, such as deliver the product or service you requested, answer the question you posed, or diagnose a technical support issue. We may use it to send you product or service notices that may be of importance to you, prevent, detect or investigate illegal or fraudulent activity, or use it as otherwise disclosed to you when you provide the information. We may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. When we contact you for this purpose, we will give you the opportunity to "opt-out" from receiving further such communications.

With regard to customer employee data that Kronos collects in accordance with a customer's instructions as set forth in our customer contract, we will only use that employee data to provide products and services consistent with those customer instructions.

With regard to Kronos job applicant and Kronos employee data, Kronos uses such data for human resources purposes such as hiring, performance evaluation, administering payroll and benefits (and related record keeping), filing government reports, administering the company's network management and authentication, security, and employee health and safety.

**6) Our Disclosure of Your Personal Information**

Kronos will not use, share or distribute that your Personal Information except: i) internally and with its service providers and/or subcontractors as required to deliver its products and services, ii) as otherwise described in the contract between Kronos and our customer, iii) as necessary to maintain the security of our products, iv) as required by applicable law, v) or as otherwise set forth in the subsequent paragraphs of this Section directly below. Kronos does not sell or rent your Personal Information to third parties for promotional purposes.

There are certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Information with certain third parties without further notice to you, including:

**Business Transfers:** As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event relating to all or a portion of our business, assets or a Site, Personal Information may be part of the transferred assets.

**Service providers, subcontractors, agents, partners and related third parties:** We sometimes hire other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples include mailing information, hosting and/or maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another party to perform a service or function, we may need to provide them with access to certain Personal Information. In that event, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific service or function. Kronos is accountable for any Personal Information that it receives from you and subsequently transfers to a third party, in accordance with applicable privacy law. We remain responsible if a third-party that we engage to process Personal Information on our behalf does so in a manner inconsistent with applicable law, unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the activities or circumstances giving rise to the claim.

We also may share information with third party partners who resell our products and services and/or provide value added services. We may offer solely or jointly with third parties, webinars, white papers, or other services related to our offerings or services. We may share your contact information and product interest in these offering or services with third parties to communicate with you.

**Legal Requirements:** We may also disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend our rights or property, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of a Site or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.

**7) Access and Control of Personal Data**

When visiting our Sites you can use many Site features without providing any Personal Information, but you may not be able to use certain services. (You can learn how cookies and similar technologies collect data on our Sites in Section 2 above.) You can always choose whether you wish to receive promotional email, SMS messages, telephone calls and postal mail from Kronos. When you otherwise contact Kronos directly, you can control what Personal Information you provide to Kronos.

Employees of Kronos' customers should contact the appropriate person within their employer's organization with whom they have a business relationship to understand, access, change and/or control what employee information is provided by the employer to Kronos so that Kronos may deliver its products and services to the employer.

Kronos takes reasonable measures to assure itself that Kronos job applicant and Kronos employee information in its possession is accurate. Job applicants and employees of Kronos should reach out to their Kronos recruiter or human resources contact, as applicable, to understand, access, change and/or control Personal Information that has been provided to Kronos in the job application or employment context.

**8) Exclusions**

This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to us through our Sites or any other means. This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of our Sites, such as Kronos Community, bulletin boards, any ideas for new products or modifications to existing services, and other unsolicited submissions including all User Content as that term is defined in our applicable Terms of Use (collectively, "Unsolicited Information"). All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and we shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without limitation or attribution. Please also note that any Personal Information or other information you provide to be displayed in your publicly available online profile, or post in Site forums will be displayed for others to see and thus will not be subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. We cannot and will not be responsible for what third parties do with any Personal Information or other information that you choose to make publicly available. As such, we advise that you exercise great care in determining what Personal Information or other information you choose to make publicly available.

**9) Children**

We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you are under thirteen, please do not submit any Personal Information to Kronos. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to Kronos, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.

**10) Links to Other Websites**

Our Sites may frame or contain references or links to other websites not owned, operated or controlled by Kronos, and their privacy policies may differ from ours (the "External Sites"). Kronos is not responsible for the privacy policies and procedures of External Sites and the privacy policies and procedures we describe here do not apply to External Sites. We recommend that you read and understand the privacy policies of External Sites.

**11) Security**

We take commercially reasonable steps to protect the Personal Information provided to Kronos from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from Kronos may not be secure. Therefore, you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Information to us or our service providers electronically. Users of our Sites and online services are responsible for maintaining the security of their passwords, user name or ID or other form of authentication needed to access to secure areas or services. We may suspend your access to a Site or one of our services, without notice and pending our investigation if a security breach is suspected.

**12) Changes to Our Privacy Policy**

At times it may be necessary for us to make changes to this Privacy Policy. Accordingly, we reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. Please review this policy periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal Information to us. Your continued disclosure of Personal Information to us after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy.

**13) Contacting Us**

You may contact us in the event you have questions about this Privacy Policy or our information practices, or if you have a question concerning the handling of your Personal Information, at: [security@kronos.com](mailto:security@kronos.com), or by postal mail sent to Privacy Officer, Kronos Incorporated, 297 Billerica Rd, Chelmsford, MA 01824.

**14) Privacy Shield and Other Compliance Mechanisms**

Kronos complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework as published by the U.S. Department of Commerce covering the collection, use and retention of Personal Information transferred from the European Union to the United States. Kronos has self-certified its compliance with the Privacy Shield to the Department of Commerce. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles relative to our commitment to protect personal data covered by the Privacy Shield, the Privacy Shield Principles shall take precedence. To view the Kronos Privacy Shield certification, see [www.privacyshield.gov](http://www.privacyshield.gov/). In addition, Kronos maintains its commitment to the US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework and its principles. We also receive and process some data from customers who operate in the European Union and transfer data to us under other compliance mechanisms, such as agreements to process data under the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.

Kronos encourages you to contact us if you have a Privacy Shield or general privacy complaint. For those Privacy Shield complaints that cannot be resolved with us directly, Kronos cooperates with EU data protection authorities (DPAs). Please contact us to be guided to the relevant DPA office and contact information. The DPAs will investigate and work with Kronos and you to resolve outstanding Privacy Shield complaints in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles. A binding arbitration option will also be made available to you to address complaints not resolved by any other means. Kronos is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

#### Privacy Statement for Kronos Talent Management Division

**Workforce Acquisition™ products**

**Purpose of This Privacy Statement:** The following statement sets out the privacy policies and practices of the Kronos Talent Management Division (Kronos TMD) which are different from the above Privacy Policy with respect to Kronos TMD's Workforce Acquisition products. This Privacy Statement applies to the collection, use, and disclosure of personally identifiable information under the terms of our customer contracts for those products. Your continued use of the Kronos TMD websites constitutes your agreement to all such terms, conditions, and notices provided in this Privacy Statement and your consent to the collection, use, disclosure, and retention of Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Statement.

**Personal Information:** If you apply for employment at one of our customers through a Kronos TMD hosted web site, Personal Information about you will be collected by the employer and Kronos TMD for use in connection with the application, interview and employment (on-boarding) process. This information may include but will not be limited to your name, physical and e-mail address, other contact information, social security number (social insurance number is not collected in Canada), prior work history, and other background information. This information will be used by the employer and Kronos TMD for purposes such as assessing your suitability for employment with the employer and its branches or affiliates, conducting background investigations, verifying information about you, conducting applicant and employment-related statistical evaluation and record keeping, to comply with legal obligations or as reasonably necessary or advisable to defend or enforce the legal rights or business interests of Kronos TMD, its users, customers or affiliates, or for such other purposes as are identified at or before the time of collection of the information or to which you consent from time to time. In the course of the application process, this information may also be disclosed to others such as companies engaged to perform background investigations or to verify the accuracy of the information contained in your application, to government agencies evaluating the application process, to third party vendors who assist the employer in performing its business functions. This information is also subject to disclosure as may be required by law. Kronos TMD may also disclose Personal Information to insurers or to legal, financial, and other professional advisors or in connection with a reorganization, sale, merger, change in control, transfer of assets, or other business transaction.

Tracking information about visits to Kronos TMD hosted sites, referring sites, and unique identifiers associated with completed employment applications may also be shared with third party advertising vendors retained by the employer to measure advertising effectiveness. Kronos TMD hosted sites do not alter behavior as a result of 'Do not track' settings in web browsers, but do not collect information about a user's browsing habits over time other than the referring site and activity on TMD hosted sites.

**Business Transitions:** In the event Kronos TMD goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' Personal Information, in most instances, will be part of the assets transferred Kronos TMD will provide its collected data to law enforcement agencies if legally required to do so pursuant to law, court order or other governmental action.

**Desktop/Console Site:** The hiring manager desktop/console products are private, password-protected, web-based software applications used by our customers to manage the hiring process. During the course of normal business processes, customers utilizing our desktop/console products may need to enter additional information about job applicants or employees hired using Kronos TMD's hiring management systems. Applicant or employer data may be transmitted, via the desktop/console products, to different locations or branches within the same company. This allows job applications to be available to multiple locations of the same company when appropriate. Applicant data may be viewed by authorized Kronos TMD staff in order to support the application and administrative needs of job seekers and our customers. For instance, if there is a problem or error in a job application, members of Kronos TMD's development team or client services department may review applications to assist in resolving the issue.

**Maintenance of Restart Codes and Passwords:** For web applications where you create a restart code and password, it is solely your responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of your password. You are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. Kronos TMD will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else having used your password, either with or without your knowledge. You could be held liable for losses incurred by Kronos TMD or another party due to someone else having used your password. You may not use anyone else's password at any time. Kronos TMD is not responsible for data which is lost or altered or for any data which you enter and submit to employers. Kronos TMD is not responsible in the event a candidate is not hired for a job.

**Special Notice to Canada Applicants:** The information collected through this web site may be stored and accessed outside Canada (including in the United States). Please note that social insurance numbers will not be collected during the application process for applicants applying in Canada.
