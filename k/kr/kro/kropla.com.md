# Privacy Policy

Protecting your privacy over the Internet is important.  At this time, the only information routinely collected from visitors to this site consists of standard usage logs.  These reveal little more about visitors other than pages viewed, type of web browser, posting domain, and in some cases, nation of domain registry. 

E-mail addresses voluntarily submitted for update notifications will not be shared with others.  No other information is collected, and "cookies" are not used here.  In fact, the logs are rarely used, and then only to learn which pages have received the most visitors.  Otherwise, e-mail addresses, names, or other detailed visitor information is neither collected nor shared for marketing or other purposes.

This site features a number of links to external sites.  These are reviewed for appropriate content before the links are established.  However, SMK Enterprises cannot control the visitor information these sites may collect, nor is it responsible for their continued performance or any changes to content.  If you are concerned about privacy on those sites, please review their privacy policy or contact their webmaster.

Need to know more?  Please **[e-mail](mailto:info@travel-advisor-online.com)** with any specific questions you might have.  Thank you.
