  1. **ABOUT THIS PRIVACY POLICY**



This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Website and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from the Website (whether through an advertisement, service, or content link) or any website of Krossover’s partners, if any, each of which may have data collection, storage, and use practices and policies that may differ materially from this Privacy Policy.

  2. **INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU**



We collect information about you so we can improve our Services and enhance your experience.  Any of the below activities with regard to the collection of Website usage information may be performed on our behalf by our service providers, including, for example, our analytics vendors, if any, and our email management partners, if any.  When analyzed, Website usage information helps us determine how visitors arrive at the Website, what type of content is most popular, and what type of visitors are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising.

While you may access some of the Krossover Services without registration, many of the content and Services available on the Website require registration.  If you choose to register with our Website, we may require you to submit certain information personally identifying you, including your first and last name, title, home/business address, date of birth, jersey number, affiliated educational institution, affiliated sports team, e-mail address, username and password (collectively, “Personal Information”). “Personal Information” also includes “Personal Data” as that term is defined in Article 2 of the European Union Data Protection Directive.

We may also ask you for account information we may require from time to time or for the purpose of authenticating yourself or your account if we have reason to believe, in our sole discretion, that you may be violating the Terms or for any other reason we deem necessary. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personal Information you submit to Krossover. You can see, review and change your Personal Information by logging into your account and accessing the Account Settings link on the Website.
