 | Privacy Notice|    
 | EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 18, 2003 |    
 | In recognition of our members' expectation of privacy, Kern Schools Federal Credit Union has adopted the following privacy statement.|    
 | Kern Schools will collect only the personal information that is necessary to conduct our business. That means just what is necessary to provide competitive financial products and services - no more. We may gather general information about site visitors' browsing activities. This enables us to track how a visitor navigates through the site and the areas in which they show interest. This is similar to a traffic report: it tracks trends and behaviors of members in general, but does not identify individuals in particular.|    
 | Kern Schools FCU will protect your personal information. We will maintain security controls to ensure that member information stored on our premises and in our files and computers is protected. Where appropriate, we will use security-coding techniques to protect against unauthorized access to personal records, ensure accuracy and integrity of communications and transactions, and protect member confidentiality.|    
 | Restrictions on the Disclosure of Account Information|    
 | 

Kern Schools Federal Credit Union will not disclose confidential member information outside the Credit Union unless: 
    1. The member consents to the disclosure; 
    2. The information is provided to help complete a transaction that the member has authorized; 
    3. Legal or regulatory requirements oblige the Credit Union to supply the information; 
    4. It is supplied to a vendor working on behalf of the Credit Union; or 
    5. It is a credit-reporting agency. 

|    
 | Employee Access and Use of Member Information|    
 | 

Within Kern Schools, the Credit Union requires that confidential information be safeguarded at all times and be used only for legitimate business purposes. 
|    
 | 

The Credit Union takes measures to limit employee access to confidential information on a "need-to-know" basis and makes every effort to ensure that financial information is maintained in an accurate and up-to-date manner. We educate our employees about the importance of confidentiality and member privacy through standard operating procedures, special training programs, and Kern Schools' Code of Ethics. 
|    
 | Maintaining Member Privacy in Our Business Relationships|    
 | 

The Credit Union will not sell or share member personal information with a third party for the third party's own independent use. However, Kern Schools occasionally contracts with outside vendors and other business partners to perform specific services for the Credit Union. We require these vendors to honor and safeguard the information we provide them and to follow strict confidentiality requirements.

We will investigate the problem and, if appropriate, update the Credit Union's records.

 | Children's Privacy Act|    
 | 

The online financial services offered through the Credit Union's web site are not designed for or directed toward children under age 13. We do not knowingly solicit or collect data from children, and we do not knowingly market to children on-line. If we receive online information from anyone that we know to be a child, we will only use the information to respond directly to a child's request.

We recognize that protecting children's identities and online privacy is important and that responsibility rests with us and with parents. If you believe your child has provided personally identifiable information to us, please contact us so that we can allow you the opportunity to review and delete such information.
