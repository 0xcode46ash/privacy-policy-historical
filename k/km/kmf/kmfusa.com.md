**4\. Normal Website Usage and Cookies**

You can visit our Site to read about product, investment, and company information, or use some of our online tools (e.g., Which Vehicles Can I Afford? and Payment Estimator) without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. During these types of visits, we collect and store statistical information on an anonymous basis, such as the information about the time and length of your visit, the website you last visited, the pages you request, and the date and time of those requests. We may also collect and store the name of your Internet Service Provider. 

We use cookies when you enter our Site to help us gather this type of statistical information that does not include personally identifiable information. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive or device for record keeping purposes so that we can track Site, and user activity. The use of cookies is an industry standard and you will find them at most websites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, if you do so, some parts of the Site may not work properly for you. 

**5\. Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**

Clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) help us better manage content on the Site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. 

We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. 

**6\. Log Files**

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol(IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. 

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track usersâ€™ movements around the Site and to improve our Site usability. 

We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. 

**7\. Do Not Track Signals**

Our Site does not currently actively respond to "Do Not Track" browser signals or mechanisms. 

**8\. Your Privacy Choices**
