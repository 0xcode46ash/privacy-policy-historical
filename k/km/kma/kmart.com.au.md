# Privacy Policy - Kmart Online Retail

### Your privacy is important

Kmart is committed to protecting the privacy of everyone who shops or interacts with us, and this policy sets out our commitment to you on privacy.

We take this responsibility seriously and ensure that we comply with our obligations under the _Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988_ whenever your personal information is collected, used or shared.

### Our commitment to you

Kmart will:

  * always use fair and lawful means of collecting your information, and in most circumstances collect your information directly from you;
  * handle your information securely and carefully, and only use your information if necessary to deliver you a service, or perform other necessary business functions and activities;
  * not use your information for purposes unrelated to our services without first obtaining your consent; and
  * wherever possible give you the option of interacting anonymously with us, if practicable and lawful to do so.



### The information we may collect

What personal information we collect will depend on the service or interaction, but may include name, address, phone and other contact details, merchandise information, and method of payment.

Depending on the circumstances, we may collect transaction information through business partners such as FlyBuys and GE Capital Finance (who administer our store cards), or other information such as where you shop or what your areas of interest are.

### Why we collect your information

We may collect your information for a number of reasons including to: deliver products or services to you, complete other transactions with you or on your behalf, improve our service, protect against fraud or theft, and provide offers that may be of interest or benefit to you. 

### How we collect your information

The personal information we collect is in most cases supplied directly by you when you give us your details, place an order for goods or services, seek a refund without a receipt, open an account with us, provide feedback to us, or shop in our stores with your FlyBuys or Coles Group Cardâ„¢.

### How we use your information 

Kmart will not sell your information to other parties. However, we often need to share your information with companies who perform parts of our service delivery - this includes other companies in the Wesfarmers Group, GE Capital, FlyBuys, and other organisations such as delivery companies, external call centres, mail houses and third party fulfilment centres.

Where we share your information, Kmart will ensure that these third parties undertake to protect your privacy. Where we store your information, Kmart will take all reasonable steps to store your information securely and to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of your information.
