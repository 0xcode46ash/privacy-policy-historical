# KQED | Got a Question? Privacy Policy

|  **The following Privacy Policy covers KQED, KQEI, KTEH, and KQET, all services of Northern California Public Broadcasting, Inc. (NCPB).**

Nothing is more important to NCPB than protecting the private information of visitors to our site. Below you'll find information about our commitment to ensuring the privacy of your and your children’s personally identifiable information (such as your full name, address, email address, telephone number and/or other identifying information) and preserving the integrity of the medium.

Please read the following carefully. If you have any questions or concerns, please send us an email at [webmaster@kqed.org](mailto:webmaster@kqed.org).

Gathering and Use of Information

NCPB will never willfully disclose any personally identifiable information about our online audience to any third party without first receiving the user’s permission. We do not collect personally identifiable information from our visitors other than what is supplied to us on a voluntary basis.

Visitors to the NCPB website may voluntarily supply certain personally identifiable information in connection with (i) contest or sweepstakes registration, (ii) subscription registration for sites or services which require subscription (such as email newsletters), (iii) requests for membership information and (iv) e-commerce transactions. In addition, personally identifiable information is voluntarily provided in connection with certain content submissions, community postings (i.e., forums or bulletin boards), comments and suggestions, or voting.

NCPB may use such information only for conducting the activities stated above, for internal marketing and promotional purposes, or, on occasion, when mailing lists are made available to other organizations. (The occasional provision of mailing lists to such organizations is the only case where such information would be provided to third parties). For more information regarding NCPB's policies on the handling and use of NCPB's membership list, please see [NCPB's Membership List Policy](https://web.archive.org/help/website/membership-list-policy.jsp). The extent of such use is always explained at the time a site visitor provides such information. If the visitor does not want this information collected and used by us for the disclosed internal purposes, the visitor is given an opportunity to "opt-out." Our visitors need to recognize, however, that under certain circumstances, if they select to "opt-out" they may not be eligible for certain activities for which the personally identifiable information is needed. (For example, if a contest participant elects to "opt-out" on permitting us to collect and use their personal information, we cannot contact them if they win without using such information.)
