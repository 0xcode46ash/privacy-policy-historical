# Privacy Policy | Handwriting Without Tears

The following Privacy Policy summarizes the ways that Handwriting Without Tears®, Get Set for School® and Keyboarding Without Tears® treat the information you provide while using this Website. Our Privacy Policy applies to all services provided by this website. One of our core goals is to protect your privacy as a general matter, and specifically with regard to the information you may choose to share with us. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Your use of the Website will constitute your agreement to this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time; the date of the most recent revisions will appear on this page, so check back often. Continued access of the Website by you constitutes your acceptance of changes or revisions to the Privacy Policy.

As you use our website and online services, we want you to be clear in how we’re using any information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy. We automatically collect and store: the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet; the Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our sites; and the Internet address of the site from which you linked directly to our sites. We use this information only in the context of our internal operations as anonymous aggregate data to determine the number of visitors to different sections of our site, to ensure the site is working properly, and to help us make our site more useful. We do not use it to track or record information about individuals.

At Handwriting Without Tears®, Get Set for School® and Keyboarding Without Tears® we take the protection of children’s online privacy seriously. We regularly review the compliance of our business practices and operations with our Privacy Policy and the children’s online privacy federal regulatory framework set forth in the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Our website and online services target an audience that includes the global adult community of educators and parents of children in the K-5 grade levels. Our website and online services do not target children themselves, particularly children under the age of thirteen. We do not collect any personally identifiable information from children as defined under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. Our website may include interactive pages or portions which allow users to experience samples of our game-based K-5 grade-level educational software products. These portions of our website provide users with the opportunity to interact with and experience our digital products. These portions do not collect user information, and by extension, do not condition online participation with our interactive game content on the user’s provision of personal information.

If you are an adult user of our Website, and you have decided to share information with us – including personally identifying information - we do use such personally identifying information supplied by you to help us provide you with the service you have requested. For example, if you order products, we may use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice and your mailing address to send you the products. We may also use the information to communicate with you about new features, products or services, and/or to improve the services that we offer by tailoring them to your needs.

Because our website does not aggregate the information that has been voluntarily shared by users, if you are a parent or a legal guardian of a child under the age of thirteen, and it has come to your knowledge that this child has entered personally identifiable or online contact information intentionally or accidentally through our website, please contact us. In compliance with COPPA’s regulatory framework, we will provide: a description of the specific types of personal information that may have been collected, the opportunity to expunge such records from within our internal operations, a means for the parent or guardian to obtain the personal information collected from the child, and any other remedy that is reasonable under the circumstances that further the interest of protecting children’s online privacy.
