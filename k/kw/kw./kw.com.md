## Information Collection

When you visit the Site, Keller Williams collects information about you and your browsing habits. The information we collect depends on the pages of our website you visit and what you do during your visit. 

Keller Williams may collect information from you automatically when you visit our website, which may include the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet; the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer; the type of browser and software operating system you use; the date and time you access our website; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked to our site. 

Several companies offer tools that allow people to browse the web anonymously. We cannot provide you a personalized experience if you use these tools, because we cannot recognize you and your computer. However, we want to ensure you know of their existence. 

Keller Williams may also use cookies to enhance browsing on our website. "Cookies" are small files or records that are placed on your computer's hard drive to collect information about your activities on our website. You can choose to have your browser warn you every time a cookie is being sent to you, and you can turn off cookie placement. If you refuse, your overall browsing experience can be affected and may prevent you from fully using the Site. Keller Williams may also use "message format" and "message open" sensing technologies to enable Keller Williams to recognize whether you have enabled your email program to receive HTML emails. If so, this information is associated with your email address so that we can send subsequent messages to you in HTML format. The "message open" sensing technology allows us to recognize whether you have opened our email messages. We can only detect this if you have enabled your email program to receive HTML emails. 

For most of the browsing services on the Site, Keller Williams does not require your personal information. There are portions of the Site where you will be given the option to provide information about you. The information that you may be asked to provide may include your name, email address, telephone number, and address. Depending on your request and other circumstances, other information may also be collected. It is your discretion and determination whether to provide such information.

In addition, Keller Williams may disclose aggregated data and statistics in order to describe the Site to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. Additionally, Keller Williams may disclose part or all of a user's personal information when Keller Williams believes, in good faith, that the law requires or compels such disclosure, or when Keller Williams has good faith reason to believe that disclosure is necessary to protect Keller Williams’ rights or property, the rights of another user or to prevent harm. Further, Keller Williams may disclose information provided by you as part of any merger, sale, acquisition, or other acquisition of same or all of Keller Williams or its assets.
