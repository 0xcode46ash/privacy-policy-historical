When you register to use this site, you will be offered the option to receive newsletters via e-mail directly from Kforce and to receive other information, including third-party promotional offers from Kforce's partners.  If you choose to receive such third-party promotional offers, Kforce will forward your profile information to an outside marketing agency which will use the information to deliver targeted e-mail offers regarding products, services, special events, and promotions that may be of interest to you.  You will have the ability to discontinue receiving such third-party offers via a link within the body of each e-mail message you receive from Kforce or by contacting us at any time at [kforce@kforce.com](mailto:kforce@kforce.com). 

When you register to use this site, you will be able to specify whether your employment information (if applicable) will be available to potential employers in searchable databases and whether your contact information will be displayed to potential employers.  You may change your choices at any time by using the Edit Profile function on our site or by sending us e-mail at [kforce@kforce.com](mailto:kforce@kforce.com).

From time to time, Kforce may also ask you for other information via surveys, such as information regarding your areas of interest, your likes and dislikes regarding the site, your career goals, services that you would like offered on this site, and other such information that will help us improve the service and features made available to you on this site.  The submission of any such information is at your option.    

**Aggregate Information**

Kforce collects information about use of this site, such as the pages users visit most frequently, the services users access the most, and the links to Kforce's partners that users most often visit.  Kforce only uses such data in the aggregate.  This information helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually improve the services and features provided to the users of our site.  We may share this collected information with our partners, but only in the aggregate, so that they too may understand how this site is used, in order to improve the services and features provided to you.  Such aggregate information will never contain any identifiable personal information.

**Resumes**

As a user of this site, you have the option of submitting or posting your resume to the site in order to apply for an employment opportunity online or participate in an employment exchange.  By doing so, your resume will be searchable and viewable and may be forwarded, transmitted, or ported to third-party clients of Kforce (which may include recruiters and placement consultants).  Kforce uses its best efforts to grant access to your resume only to such clients.  However, Kforce is not responsible or liable if some other third party evades security measures and gains access to your resume.  At any time, you may remove or request the removal of your resume from our searchable database or the site or request that your resume not be forwarded.  However, Kforce's clients that have access to the database or received your resume may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases.  Kforce is not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes in such instances.

Kforce may use "cookies"  to maintain your session on this site.  Kforce does not use cookies to capture or store personal information from your computer.  The only personal information Kforce receives is the information you provide to us.  However, this policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third-party advertisers whose banner ads appear on this site.  Kforce does not have direct control over or access to any information collected via such banner ads.   Such information is collected and controlled by a third party, 24/7 Media, Inc.  For more information about privacy related to banner ads, please see 24/7 Media, Inc.'s Privacy Statement located at [www.247media.com/privacy.htm](http://www.247media.com/privacy.htm)[ _ **Disclosure**_](http://www.247media.com.%20%20wwdisclosure/) _ **of Information**_

Kforce will not knowingly disclose to any third party your personal information or information about your individual visits to this site without your prior consent, except to the extent necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable laws, legal process served on Kforce, or in legal proceedings where (i) such information is relevant or (ii) where Kforce believes in good faith that the law requires such disclosure.  As described above, Kforce may record and share aggregated information with our partners.  Kforce uses its best efforts to protect your personal information.  However, Kforce is not responsible or liable for the acquisition of your personal information by third parties without Kforce's knowledge and Kforce has no control over anything that occurs on servers not controlled by Kforce.  Further, to the extent that you include your personal information (including e-mail address) on any resume you submit or post to the site, Kforce cannot control the use of such information by third-party clients of Kforce that obtain your resume from the site or Kforce. 

**_User Communications_**

In the event that you communicate any information, feedback, data, questions, comments, suggestions or other items to Kforce regarding Kforce, this site and its contents, or the services offered on this site, any such communication shall be deemed not to be confidential and shall become the property of Kforce.  Kforce shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose and distribute such communication to others, without limitation.  Kforce shall also have the unrestricted right to use any ideas, concepts, know-how, software, documentation, diagrams, drawings, schematics or techniques contained in your communication in any manner and for any purpose whatsoever including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing and marketing products or providing services.

We recommend that you do not divulge your Kforce password to anyone.  Kforce will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail.  Also, remember to sign out of your Kforce account and close your browser window when you have finished your work.  This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.

  
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Kforce cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk.  Once we receive your transmission, we use our best efforts to ensure its security on our systems by using secure servers behind a firewall.
