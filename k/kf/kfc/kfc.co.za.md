# WebEasy | Welcome to Flux Webeasy your first choice in quality web design!

"[ _Flux Interactive_](http://www.webeasyflux.fl/home.asp?pid=1#test) shall not be responsible and disclaims all liability for any loss, liability, damage (whether direct or consequential) or expense of any nature whatsoever which may be suffered as a result of or which may be attributable, directly or indirectly, to the use of or reliance upon any information, links or service provided through this website."

We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. That is why we have adopted this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy lets you know how your personal information is processed and used. We promise that we will take steps to use your personal information only in ways that are compatible with this Privacy Policy. The following policies are only in effect for the Web pages owned and operated by Flux Interactive Pty (Ltd).

What information are you collecting and how are you collecting it?  
Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers, that serve as that computer's "Internet Protocol" IP address. When a visitor requests a page from any Web site within the flux.co.za network, our web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, but do not collect and evaluate this information for individuals. Our web servers do not record e-mail addresses of the visitors. 

From time to time, flux.co.za may send a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Cookies do not damage your system. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our site and other web sites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended. 

| **What** | other information do you request?   
---|---  
  
We may also request your e-mail address or mailing address for the purposes of conducting a survey or to provide additional services (for example, subscriptions to e-mail newsletters, announcement lists or information about seminars). Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. We maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy that means that we do not intend to sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third-party, without your consent. In addition, Flux Interactive will not send you email that you have not agreed to receive. We may from time to time send e-mail announcing new Flux Interactive products and services.

**What** | information do you collect when I purchase something?  
---|---  
  
If you are purchasing something from Flux Interactive, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. This information may also be used by us to notify you of related product and services, but will not be shared or sold to third parties for any purpose. Certain Flux Interactive websites use a shopping cart feature that safeguards this information by using industry standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encrypted servers. SSL codes the information transferred between you and the server, rendering it unreadable to anyone trying to intercept the information. Other Flux Interactive websites do not use SSL and thereby do not offer a secure coded way to transfer information. Wherever Flux Interactive collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page. 

**Will** | you disclose the information you collect to outside third parties?  
---|---  
  
Flux Interactive will disclose personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to:

  * Conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on Flux Interactive, 
  * Protect and defend the rights or property of the Flux Interactive and its websites, or visitors to Flux Interactive websites, 
  * Identify persons who may be violating the law, the legal notice, or the rights of third parties, 
  * Cooperate with the investigations of purported unlawful activities. 



Flux Interactive uses reasonable precautions to keep the information disclosed to us secure. Flux Interactive reserves the right to transfer information in connection with the sale of all or part of Flux Interactives capital stock or assets. Furthermore, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties that receive the information. Flux Interactive also links to a wide variety of other sites and contains advertisements of third parties. We are not responsible for their privacy policies or how they treat information about their users See below, What else should I know about my privacy when online?

**What** | else should I know about my privacy when online?  
---|---  
  
The Flux Interactive and its web sites contain many links to other Web sites. Flux Interactive is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. Flux Interactive does not share any of the individual personal information you provide Flux Interactive with the sites to which Flux Interactive links, although Flux Interactive may share aggregate data with such web sites (such as how many people use our site). Please check with those sites to determine their privacy policy. Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example through e-mail, discussion lists, or elsewhere - that information can be collected and used by others. 

In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your personal information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online. 

**Your** | consent to this agreement  
---|---  
  
By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of information by flux Interactive as specified above. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
