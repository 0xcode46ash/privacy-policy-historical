# KVUE 24 Privacy Policy

****

Like many other commercial sites, KVUE 24 collects information that helps us to improve our services and bring you information suited to your individual needs. At the same time, we recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of personal identifying information of our customers and prospects. We believe that protection of personal privacy on the web not only protects consumers, but also increases consumer confidence. In adopting this privacy policy, our intent is to balance our legitimate business interests with your reasonable expectations of privacy. 

In some instances, we operate shared web sites with businesses affiliated with us. While this privacy policy applies to our sites, we do not control the privacy policies of our business partners, advertisers, sponsors or other sites to which we provide hyperlinks. Users should check the applicable privacy policy of the web site sponsor when linking to other sites. Users should also keep in mind that when you voluntarily disclose personal information in chat areas or bulletin boards, that information might be collected by others and could result in unsolicited messages from others.

**Personal Identifying Information**

KVUE.COM does not collect personal identifying information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. We may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal information such as your E-mail address, postal address, telephone number, credit card number (only if you choose to purchase a product online), for purposes such as correspondence, making a purchase, or participating in online contests, surveys, or games. We may also use personal identifying information for editorial, marketing, and promotional purposes. This may include aggregating information according to demographics and performing statistical analyses. KVUE.COM does not share personal identifying information with any third party without your permission. We disclose only in aggregate form our statistical analyses or demographics of users to third parties, such as advertisers or other business partners. If any personally identifiable information is to be transferred to a party outside of KVUE.COM, we will inform you at the time that we request the information.

**Cookies**

Our sites may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how our site is used. Cookies help a web site recognize a user’s browser as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was browsing the site. They may collect information about which pages are visited and the domain name (e.g., funlink.com) of visitors. They can enhance your visit by keeping track of parts of a site that you have already visited and any selections you’ve made, such as those selected in a "shopping cart." With this information, we are able to customize delivery of information without compromising privacy. For example, cookies can be used to ensure that you don’t see the same ad too many times in a single session. **We only use cookies to gather the information indicated in this policy and do not use cookies to gather personal identifying information.** A cookie itself does not contain any personal identifying information. We may use the information collected by cookies for internal review, for traffic audits, and for market research. 

**A message for kids and parents**

**Kids** , be sure to ask your parents for permission before you send any information about yourself -- like your name, address, or e-mail address -- over the Internet, to us or to anyone else and before making any purchases online. **Parents** , we encourage you to get involved with your children's online usage and to be aware of the activities in which they are participating. Any personal identifying information collected by _KVUE.COM_ from children (that we are aware are children) will be used only for _KVUE.COM_ purposes such as market research, sweepstakes fulfillment or for fulfilling requests for information or materials. Such information will not be posted or published by us, or provided to any third parties, without your prior consent. Anonymous aggregated data is sometimes provided to other parties for statistical and market research purposes as described above. Finally, you should be aware that if your child voluntarily discloses information in forums or chat areas, such disclosures may result in unsolicited messages from other parties. 

**Future Developments**

As technology on the Internet continues to develop at a rapid pace, we intend to maintain our flexibility in the online arena. Our intent is to let you know how your privacy will continue to be protected as developments arise. If we need to change our policy in the future, we will post these changes as soon as they go into effect. If you have further questions about _KVUE.COM’s_ privacy policy, you can find out more by E-mailing us at webmaster@kvue.com, or by mailing your question or request to Webmaster, KVUE 24 Television- 3201 Steck Avenue, Austin, TX 78757.
