# Privacy | K5 Learning

## K5 Learning is safe for your children

The children’s area of our website (the pages your child uses after logging in) contains

  * no advertising or commercial messages
  * no external links
  * no “chat”, message board or similar features



We strongly disagree with the amount of advertising targeted at young children, and we will **never** target your children with any sort of commercial messages.

We do not collect children’s e-mail addresses and we will never contact your child in any way.

We also respect **your** privacy. We will not give your e-mail address or other personal information to anybody.

#### Children's Privacy Guidelines

  * We do not collect any information directly from children other than the performance data they generate as they complete our lessons. 
  * We do not give the ability for children to publicly post or otherwise distribute personal information. 
  * We do not distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information without prior parental consent. 



#### Performance Data

As your child completes lessons, we do record certain data (“Performance Data”) related to their interactions with the program (e.g. the score on a quiz). We will use Performance Data to measure your child’s performance and to adapt the lessons to his or her learning needs and provide you with progress reports about your child’s performance. In addition, we may aggregate your child’s Performance Data with the Performance Data of other children using our website for marketing and other business related purposes. Aggregate information will be anonymous and will not identify your child.

#### External Links

The public areas of our web site and the Parent Dashboard area contain various background and marketing materials related to K5. These pages are not used by children who have logged onto the site using the student login, and may contain links to web sites not maintained by K5. The privacy and data collection practices on any linked web sites are entirely separate from K5 and are not covered by this Privacy Policy.

#### Education Partners

Our lessons are licensed from leading U.S. education companies ( our “Education Partners”). Certain web pages delivered to the student when doing his lessons will be delivered from the servers of our Education Partners and certain links your child will use to initiate lessons will link to these servers. These web pages are customized for K5 and are considered to be part of our website for purposes of this Privacy Policy. Certain parts of your child’s Performance Data will be retained on the servers of our Education Partners. We do not share your or your child’s personal information with our Education Partners in any way that would allow them to personally identify you or your child or who the Performance Data belongs to. The policies and procedures of our Education Partners fully conforms with the provisions of K5’s privacy policy.

#### What security measures do we take?

K5 has taken reasonable steps to ensure that all information received from our subscribers is secure against unauthorized access and use. However, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure and any information disclosed online can potentially be collected and used by parties other than the intended recipient.

#### Cookies

K5 uses “cookies”. A cookie is a small amount of data sent to your browser from our web server and stored on your computer, then sent back to the server by your browser each time you access our website. Cookies enable us to track usage of our website. Cookies are not used to gather personal information from your computer.

Your family's use of this site is conditioned on your having accepted these terms. You should check back to this policy frequently, since it is subject to change from time to time, and your continued use of the site is conditioned upon your acceptance of any modifications hereto.
