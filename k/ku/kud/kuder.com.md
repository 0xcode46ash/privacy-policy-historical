### Limitations on Data Collection

In furtherance of Kuder's effort to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, and to insure the security of data collected from children under the age of 13, Kuder only collects data from such children pursuant to the Parental Permission and a specific agreement between the child's school and Kuder that Kuder is to act as an agent of the child’s school or educational institution. Kuder specifically contracts with such institutions for services which allow the school to input individual information for each child onto the web site. It is important that Kuder and the schools comport to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and obtain parental permission, if required under the Act, before completing the child's registration with the web site, or before allowing a child to complete registration. If Kuder receives a direct request from a child under 13 to access the system, and Kuder has not received written consent from a parent or guardian, Kuder will utilize the information solely for a one-time response to the child.

You or the school will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner.
