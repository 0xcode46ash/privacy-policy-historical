**INFORMATION**

NCASI® is the sole owner of the information collected on this web site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. We collect information from our users at several different points on our web site. 

NCASI® does not target registration to or knowingly collect information directly from, anyone under 13 years of age. Additionally, NCASI® will never distribute any personally identifiable information, concerning any minor, regardless of the source from which it was obtained. 

Remember, however, the very best protection involves counseling your children regarding providing information online, and supervising their online activities. If you have any questions regarding any aspect of our Privacy Policy or would like to remove any information which you believe was inadvertently collected directly from a child under thirteen years of age, please email us at [webmaster@ncasi.com](mailto:webmaster@ncasi.com)

In order to use this web site, you must first complete the registration form. During registration you are required to give your contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact you about the services on our web site for which you have expressed interest.

**ORDERS**

We request information from you on our order form. Here you must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date).

**COOKIES**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive containing information about you. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our web site. Once you close your browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our web site, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our web site. If you reject the cookie, you may still use our web site. The only drawback to this is that you will be limited in some areas of our web site. For example, you will not be able to participate in any of our Sweepstakes or Contests. Cookies can also enable us to track and target your interests to enhance your experience on our web site.

Some of our business partners use cookies on our web site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.

**IP ADDRESSES**

We use IP addresses for analyzing trends, administering the web site, tracking user’s movement, and gathering broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**PARTNERS**

Although we share aggregate demographic data with our partners and advertisers, this data is not linked to any personal information identifying any individual person.

We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

We sometimes partner with another company to provide specific services. When you sign up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the companies to provide these services to you. These companies are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

From time-to-time our web site may request information from you via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and, therefore, you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.

Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this web site.

**REFERRALS**

If you use our referral program to inform a friend about our web site, we ask you for the friend’s name and email address. NCASI® will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the web site. NCASI® stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may send an email to [webmaster@ncasi.com](mailto:webmaster@ncasi.com) to request the removal of this information from their database.

**SECURITY**

This web site takes every precaution to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the web site, your information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks you to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect your information off-line. All of your information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.

If you have any questions about the security at our web site, you can send an email to [webmaster@ncasi.com](mailto:webmaster@ncasi.com)

**SPECIAL OFFERS**

We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for your privacy we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below.

**POLICY CHANGES**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you by way of an email.
