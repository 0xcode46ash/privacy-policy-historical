**LIMITATIONS ON DATA COLLECTION**

In furtherance of NCASI's effort to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, and to insure the security of data collected from children under the age of 13, NCASI only collects data from such children pursuant to a specific agreement that NCASI is to act as an agent of the child’s school or educational institution. NCASI specifically contracts with such institutions for services which allow them to input individual information for each child onto the website. It is important that schools comport to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and obtain parental permission, if required under the Act, before inputting a child's information onto the website, or before allowing a child to input the information themselves. If NCASI receives a direct request from a child under 13 to access the system, and the child has not provided NCASI with written consent from a parent or guardian and the child is not affiliated with an authorized educational institution for whom NCASI acts as an agent, NCASI will utilize the information solely for a one-time response to the child.

**CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY**

If at any time NCASI makes changes to this Privacy Policy, we will inform parents of those children who have input data onto the website and who, at the time of the policy change, are under the age of 13, or will contact the authorized school administrator in lieu thereof, of the policy change and how any policy change will affect the collection utilization and dissemination of any information. If, at this or any other time, the parent and/or school administrator wishes to change or remove any information from NCASI's database related to data collected from children under the age of 13, they may utilize the Changing Personal Information or Opt In/Opt Out provisions outlined below, or contact the NCASI website administrator at [ncasi@ncasi.com](mailto:ncasi@ncasi.com), by written communication to Webmaster, NCASI, PO Box 277, Adel, Iowa, 50003, or directly by telephone at 800-314-8972.
