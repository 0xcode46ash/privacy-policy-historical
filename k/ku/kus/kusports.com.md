The World Company is sensitive to issues of individual privacy on the Internet. To that end, we provide the following policy on the use of information gathered on KUSports.com:

**Categories of information collected**

¢ KUSports.com gathers identifying information about individuals only when individuals provide that information on a voluntary basis such as in our reader comments and blogs, for our SMS and email alerts and when using our [social networking tools](https://web.archive.org/social/).

**Third parties**

It is not the policy of The World Company to sell or make available such information to unrelated third parties; occasionally such information may be shared with other divisions of the World Company. We may inform advertisers of the results of such analyses. And under any circumstance, KUSports.com will refer only to general, aggregate usage data from these analyses - never specific identifying information. If you choose to participate in our [social networking tools](https://web.archive.org/social/), your favorites may be shared with other KUSports.com users who are also taking advantage of those tools.

¢KUSports.com allows users to utilize site-wide [social networking tools](https://web.archive.org/social/), which can include befriending other users, updating profile information, posting comments on other users profiles and identifying pieces of content as something of interest to a user. When a user takes advantage of the [social networking tools](https://web.archive.org/social/), the user is agreeing to share personal information with other users. KUSports.com provides [privacy tools within its social networking framework](https://web.archive.org/social/privacy/) to enable users to control which types of personal information is shared with other users.

¢ KUSports.com performs statistical analyses of its server logs to study the use and popularity of various areas of our site. We also look at IP addresses to analyze where we are getting our audience.

¢ Users should keep in mind that, when posting their user name or e-mail address on bulletin boards or in other user-posted content areas, that information, along with any information in their postings, can be read by any third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. KUSports.com has no control over that.

¢ KUSports.com may make use of or refer to user-posted content for the purposes of promotion of KUSports.com. This will mainly involve taking screen shots of a particular area of the site and using that screen shot as a graphic in an advertisement. KUSports.com makes no claim of ownership to such user-posted content.

¢ KUSports.com employs 'cookies' in circumstances that require session data or require user verification.
