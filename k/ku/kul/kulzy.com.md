The information you supply will help us to make The Kulzy Site a better website by allowing us to tailor our site to your interests and make it more useful to you. Supplying such information is entirely voluntary. Moreover, the information supplied by you is subject to verification as in many cases where the subscriber has enlisted as a Freelancer, the content delivered by him to the client has to be within the legal framework of the internet subject to the Indian Laws. In some instances, which involve, for example, subscriptions, you may need to provide all the information before the subscription can reach you if we don't know how to contact you.
