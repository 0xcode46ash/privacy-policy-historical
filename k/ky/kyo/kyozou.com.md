**Privacy Statement**

Kyozou Inc. ("Kyozou") respects your privacy and is committed to protect the personal information that you share with us.

When we do need your personal information to provide services that you request or when you choose to provide us with your personal information, this policy describes how we collect and use your personal information. 

**Information Collection**   
Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, email address, a home, postal or other physical address, other contact information, title, birth date, gender, occupation, industry, personal interests, and other information when needed to provide a service you requested. When you browse our website, you do so anonymously. We don't collect personal information, including your email address. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our website you visit and how long you spend there. But we do not link your IP address to any personal information unless you have logged in to our website. Like many other commercial websites, the Kyozou website may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the site (which is described below in more detail). 

Your personal information may be collected when you register and/or enter into an agreement for the provisions of services, which include, but are not limited to, marketplace management system, on-line inventory and retail management systems and product shipping management systems by Kyozou or any other services which Kyozou may, in the future, provide to consumers of its services (collectively, the "Services"), or in any other way listed in this Privacy Policy.

From time to time, Kyozou receives personal information from business partners and vendors. Virutman only uses such information if it has been collected in accordance with acceptable privacy practices consistent with this Policy and applicable laws. If you choose to provide us with your personal information, we may transfer that information, within the Kyozou organization, to our affiliates, subsidiaries and any other related corporations (" **Related Companies** ").
