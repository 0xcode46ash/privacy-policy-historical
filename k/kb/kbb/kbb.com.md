# Kelley Blue Book - Privacy Policy

  


#### _General_

Visitors browsing the Kelley Blue Book Web site do so on a completely anonymous basis. We never collect any personal information such as names, addresses, email addresses or credit card numbers from our visitors as vehicle pricing information is researched. We do, however, collect some non-specific visitor information, such as ZIP Codes and vehicle pricing requests, which we use to produce vehicle pricing reports, analyze the usage of the site, and customize online advertising and promotional offers. Kelley Blue Book does aggregate non-specific visitor information for statistical purposes, such as the production of our [ Top 50 Cars](https://web.archive.org/kb/ki.dll/kw.kc.sp?kbb&&55&hot) list. None of this information is personally identifiable to our visitors.

#### _Cookies_

The Kelley Blue Book Web site makes limited use of "cookies" for the purpose of facilitating the gathering of non-specific visitor information to produce vehicle pricing reports. A cookie is a very small text file stored on a Web site visitor's hard disk that allows a Web server to recall certain information that the visitor has already entered previously. The cookies issued from the Kelley Blue Book Web servers store a visitor's ZIP Code and contain no personal information. If a visitor wishes to not utilize cookie technology, this feature may be disabled within the visitor's Web browser.
