Cookies 

KBB may set and access KBB cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a Web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information (such as your ZIP Code) on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of delivering relevant content, eases site navigation, and so on. When you return to the Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the site's features that you customized. 

KBB lets other companies, including business partners and companies that show advertisements on some of our pages, set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies. Advertisers or other companies may have access to KBB's cookies. 

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of this or other Web sites you visit. 

Web Beacons 

KBB uses Web beacons (also known as clear gif technology, or action tags) to access KBB cookies inside and outside our Web site and to collect data and allow other companies to collect data. Web beacons may be used to assist in delivering cookies on our site. This technology is a tool we may also use to compile aggregated statistics about the KBB Web site usage, such as how many visitors clicked on key elements (such as links or graphics) on a page. We may share aggregated site statistics with other companies, and we may allow other companies to place their clear gifs or cookies on our site. 

Protection of Children's Personal Information 

KBB is a general audience site and does not knowingly collect any personal information from children. 

Changes to this Privacy Policy 

KBB may occasionally update this privacy policy. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy policy. If we make material changes to this privacy policy, we will place a prominent notice at the top of the privacy policy and you will also see the word "Updated" next to the Privacy Policy link on the front page of the KBB Web site. We encourage you to periodically review this privacy policy to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect.
