One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a Web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information (such as your ZIP Code) on subsequent visits.

If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of this or other Web sites you visit.

Web Beacons

Kelley uses Web beacons (also known as clear gif technology, or action tags) to access Kelley cookies inside and outside our Web site and to collect data and allow other companies to collect data. Web beacons may be used to assist in delivering cookies on our site. This technology is a tool we may also use to compile aggregated statistics about the Kelley Web site usage, such as how many visitors clicked on key elements (such as links or graphics) on a page. We may share aggregated site statistics with other companies, and we may allow other companies to place their clear gifs or cookies on our site.
