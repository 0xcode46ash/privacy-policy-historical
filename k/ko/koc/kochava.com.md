The following Kochava Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) relates solely to our Kochava Platform and users of the website www.kochava.com. In particular, we believe it is important for users to know how we treat information that we may receive, gather, or collect in connection with clients utilizing the Kochava Platform and by visiting www.kochava.com. It is also intended to explain the conditions under which Kochava uses and discloses that information, and your rights in relation to that information.

We Self-Certify Compliance With:

Kochava complies with the U.S. – E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S. – Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland.

Definitions

**Advertiser:** An Advertiser is any person or company that promotes their product or a component of their product using the Kochava Platform. For example, Advertisers may promote their mobile application, a specific promotion within their app, an app update, event, or a company announcement, and use the Kochava Platform to attribute these events.

**Attribution:** Attribution is a general term used to describe the process user interactions within apps and around the advertising ecosystem are measured. For example, a user may click on an advertisement, download an app, and make an in-app purchase – each of these actions would be considered an Attribution within the Kochava Platform.

**Geographic Location Data:** Advertiser clients may collect Geographic Location Data from an IP address through the Platform to give them deeper insight into the performance of their advertising campaigns. Geographic Location data is non precise geographic data that determines location from IP address, GPS coordinates and/or Wi-Fi networks.  
**  
Kochava Platform:** The Kochava Platform is a back-end technology that provides unique attribution matching using advertising identifiers and/or statistical identifiers to measure the performance of a mobile ad campaign.

**Kochava Platform SDK:** The Kochava Platform SDK is computer code inserted into a Developer’s mobile app to enable the Developer to collect Unique Advertising Identifiers and Statistical Identifiers from the user for the purpose of measuring performance.

**“Non-Personally-Identifying Information”** is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person.  
**  
Partners:** Partners are third parties that Advertiser clients work with to promote applications, networks, offers, and/or advertisements, including but not limited to: ad networks, publishers, advertisers, affiliates, analytics providers, and data providers.

**“Personally-Identifying Information,”** is information such as a name or email address that, without more, can be directly associated with a specific person.

**Postbacks:** Postbacks are server-to-server communications that allow parties to share information.

**Statistical Identifiers:** Statistical Identifiers are used to provide attribution when Unique Advertising Identifiers are unavailable. Statistical Identification involves the collection of publicly-available HTTP headers from the end user’s device. The Kochava Platform uses the HTTP headers to probabilistically determine which device is responsible for the Attribution and collects the following data points: country code, device brand, device model, device carrier, IP address, language preference, operating system name, operating system version, user agent (browser type), and timestamp.

**Unique Advertising Identifiers:** Unique Advertising Identifiers are user-specific, unique character strings for advertising that can be reset by the user. Examples of Unique Advertising Identifiers include IDFA (developed by Apple for the iPhone), Google Ad ID (developed by Google for Android), and Windows advertising ID (developed by Microsoft for the Windows Phone).

Kochava may use Web Beacons on the Website to count users who have visited particular pages and to deliver co-branded services.
