We will not give away or sell any Facebook User Data. Any Social Behavioral Data or User Behavioral Data that is exposed beyond the sandbox of the Customer will be used in an anonymous fashion whereby it is not possible to identify the originating application and Customer that collected the data.

We restrict access to personal information to Kontagent employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
