# Privacy Policy

**Collection and Use of Personal  Information**

Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.

You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with KontrolFreek or a KontrolFreek affiliated company. KontrolFreek and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. You are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested. If you choose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have.

**What personal information we collect**

  * When you create a KontrolFreek account, purchase a product, contact us or participate in an online survey or contest, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, and credit card information.
  * When you invite others to participate in KontrolFreek services or forums, KontrolFreek may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number. KontrolFreek will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes.



**How we use your personal  information**

  * The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on KontrolFreek’s latest product announcements, contests, and upcoming events. If you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by sending an email to: [unsubscribe@KontrolFreek.com](mailto:unsubscribe@KontrolFreek.com) with the word “unsubscribe” in the subject.
  * We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.
  * We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine appropriate services. For example, we may use date of birth to determine the age of KontrolFreek account holders.
  * From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with KontrolFreek, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.
  * We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve KontrolFreek’s products, services, and customer communications.
  * If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.



**Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information**

We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:

  * We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, location, and the time zone where a KontrolFreek product is purchased so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.
  * We may collect information regarding customer activities on our website and from our other products and services. This information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest. Aggregated data is considered non‑personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
  * We may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries. This information may be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services. Except in limited instances to ensure quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP address.



If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.

**Cookies and Other Technologies**

KontrolFreek’s websites, email messages, and advertisements may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non‑personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.

KontrolFreek and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with KontrolFreek more convenient and personal. Knowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us tailor your interaction with our website and provide you with better customer service.

If you want to disable cookies, check with your browser provider to find out how to disable cookies. Please note that certain features of the KontrolFreek website may not be available once cookies are disabled.

As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. KontrolFreek may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.

In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the KontrolFreek website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.

Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customer’s can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.

**Disclosure to Third Parties**

At times KontrolFreek may make certain personal information available to strategic partners that work with KontrolFreek to provide products and services, or that help KontrolFreek market to customers. Personal information will only be shared by KontrolFreek to provide or improve our products, services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.

**Service Providers**

KontrolFreek shares personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever KontrolFreek operates.

**Others**

It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for KontrolFreek to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.

We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.

**Protection of Personal  Information**

KontrolFreek takes the security of your personal information very seriously. KontrolFreek online services such as the KontrolFreek website protect your personal information during transit using encryption such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). When your personal data is stored by KontrolFreek, we use computer systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical security measures.

When you use some KontrolFreek services, or post on an KontrolFreek forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information and content you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to share or submit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public. Please take care when using these features.

**Integrity and Retention of Personal Information**

KontrolFreek makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date. We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

**Access to Personal Information**

You can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by logging in to your account. For other personal information we hold, we will provide you with access for any purpose including to request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if KontrolFreek is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes. We may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.

**Third‑Party Sites and Services**

KontrolFreek websites, products, emails, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services. Our products and services may also use services from third parties.

Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed by their privacy practices.

**International Users**

All the information you provide may be transferred or accessed by entities around the world as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Our Companywide Commitment to Your  Privacy**

To make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to KontrolFreek employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.
