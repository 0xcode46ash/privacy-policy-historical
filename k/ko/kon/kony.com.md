###  At Kony, we respect your right to privacy and we understand that visitors to [www.kony.com](http://www.kony.com/) need to control the uses of their personal information. The privacy policy below describes the measures taken by us to protect your privacy in connection with your use of our website.

##  What personally identifiable information do we collect and when do we collect it?

**Registration.**  You may visit our website and browse without giving us your personal information. However, some areas are only accessible by registering. When you register or make a request for information, we ask for your name, company name, title, mailing address, email address and phone number. 

**IP Address.**  An Internet Protocol (“IP”) address is a unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We will use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. Your IP address also may be used to gather broad demographic information. 

**Cookies.**  A “cookie” is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain websites. We use cookies to collect, store and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the services we provide. If you are a registered user, we will use a cookie to save your settings and to provide customizable and personalized services. These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your personally identifiable information. Additionally, be aware that if you visit other websites you may be required to accept cookies. Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We do not control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them. 

##  How do we use your personally identifiable information?

**E-mail.**  If you register with our website, from time to time, we may send you e-mail messages informing you of our products and services and also third party products and services we believe may be of interest to you, such as new features and services, special offers and updated information. Our e-mails may contain code that enables our database to track your usage of the newsletters, including whether the e-mail was opened and/or what links (if any) were clicked. We will combine such information with other information we have about you and may use this information to improve your experience with our website and/or provide customized e-mail communications to you. 

##  With whom do we share your personally identifiable information?

We will not share your personally identifiable information with third parties (aside from entities that perform services for us, such as processing credit card payments, that either are bound to comply with our privacy policy or have privacy policies that protect your information) unless you have “opted-in” to such sharing. 

However, we may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process served on us; (2) protect and defend our rights or property; or (3) act in an emergency to protect someone’s safety. 

We may gather demographic information from you from time to time. We will not share such information with any other person or entity in a manner that identifies you as an individual, unless we let you know that at the time of collection or we have your permission. When we share demographic information with third parties, we will give them aggregate information only. 

As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets, and, depending upon the transaction, your personally identifiable information may be one of the transferred assets. In the event that we are acquired by another company, your personal information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party.

We will promptly delete the information upon learning that it relates to a child under the age of 13. We believe that parents should supervise their children’s online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from otherwise disclosing online their name, address and other personal information without parental permission.
