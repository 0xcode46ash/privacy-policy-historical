## Kony Data Privacy Policy

This privacy policy tells you about Kony, Inc.’s policies and practices for the collection, use, processing, storage, and disclosure of information that we collect about you through our websites and services. It applies to your use of our website located at http://www.kony.com (the "website"), but does not apply to any third party sites that may be linked to our website.

The terms "we," "us," "our," and "Kony PAAS" refer to Kony, Inc.  The terms "you" and "your" refer to you, as a subscriber of our services. The term "personal information" means information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, phone number, email address, and other data that is tied to such information. By using our website and services you agree to be bound by the terms of this privacy policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, PLEASE DO NOT USE KONY PAAS.

_General principles_

Kony respects your privacy and seeks to protect your data. We hope that the information in this policy will show you how we gather, use, and protect your personal data.  We aim to ensure that the processing of personal data by or on behalf of Kony is fair and reasonable and that your personal data is secure, accurate, and up to date.

Because Kony PAAS and its services are online, as a result they are international; hence personal data may be made available internationally, including in countries that do not have data protection laws or laws that provide equivalent protection to European or North American rules.

_What information Kony collects, and why we collect it_

Kony collects information about our users and other individuals it deals with in its day-to-day business. This information includes contact and registration information, information about the way registered users use our services, as well as details of individuals' interests. It is used for administration and to support, improve, and obtain feedback on Kony products, and to prevent and detect breaches of security, the law, or our contract terms.

In addition, Kony may ask for information about your business, including but not limited to information such as industry, business model, or company address details.

Where allowed by law, Kony may collate information about individuals and businesses that it receives from others with the information we obtain directly. The information described above may be retained and used by Kony after an individual or business ceases to use Kony’s services or the individual has ceased dealing with us.

Kony will also use all this information to assess what Kony products and services may be of interest to individuals and to personalize the service(s) we provide. If you are registered to use a service, Kony may contact you to obtain feedback on that service and any improvements we could make to it.

The law often allows you to write and ask to see and correct the information held about you, sometimes on payment of a fee.

_Transfer of data to third parties_

Kony does not share, sell, rent, or trade personal data with third parties for their promotional purposes. We do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server companies.

Kony does use third-party entities to provide valuable services on our behalf. To provide these services to you, we need your explicit consent to share your personal data with them. Third parties with which we share your information are bound by all relevant data privacy laws, terms of confidentiality, and this privacy policy. For a complete list of these third parties and the services they provide, [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact).

If your employer subscribed for the service on your behalf, then we may pass certain information to your employer about your use of the service where your employer has a legitimate reason to receive it.

_Cookies_

A "cookie" is a piece of software that may be sent to your computer. Cookies enable us to collect information about how our websites and services are being used and to manage them. They also allow us to automate the login procedure each time you enter Kony's website. If we send a cookie to your computer, it will be to collect information for the above stated purpose with your expressed consent to do so. Until then, the cookie will only track general usage patterns and will not be used to identify you individually.

_Security_

We follow generally accepted industry standards such as firewalls and encryption and data privacy legal requirements to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and after we receive it, against loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, e-mail sent may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any personal information to us or to any other party via the internet. You hereby acknowledge that we are not responsible for any intercepted information sent via the internet, and you hereby release us from any and all claims arising out of or related to the use of intercepted information in any unauthorized manner.

_Changes to this privacy policy_

We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy policy page, to the Kony, Inc. homepage, and to other places that we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, who has access to it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
