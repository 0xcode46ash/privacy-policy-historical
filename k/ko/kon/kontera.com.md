## Kontera Privacy Notice

Welcome to the Kontera Technologies, Inc. ("Kontera") web site at [http://www.kontera.com/ (the "Site")](http://www.kontera.com/).

Kontera operates a technology platform (the “Platform”) that provides marketing insights and digital advertising solutions to the world’s leading brands and marketing agencies.

Kontera values the privacy of Internet visitors (“Users”) to the Site, our Customers, and Users that visit websites where our analytics and digital advertising technology (our “Technology”) is enabled. For purposes of this policy, we refer to our Platform and Technology as the “Services.”

This Privacy Notice describes what information we gather from Users of the Site and our Customers, how we use that information, and what we do to protect it. This Privacy Notice also describes the privacy practices pertaining to our Services, how the Technology gathers information from Users, how it uses that information, and what we do to protect the information stored on our Platform. This Privacy Notice is incorporated into the Kontera Terms of Service. Your use of the Site and any personal information you provide on the Site are subject to the terms of this Privacy Notice and Kontera's [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/about/terms-of-service).

### Advertising Choices

Kontera specializes in providing consumers with information that is related to what they are reading. We get our revenues by showing editorially relevant ads to consumers.

When choosing which ads to show you, Kontera does not use any information that personally identifies you, such as your name, address, e-mail, phone number, etc.

While Kontera most often shows you ads based on the content of the page you are visiting, we occasionally show some ads based on additional non personally identifiable information, such as the types of websites you visit, the ads you view, interactions you've had with ads, and searches you conduct on other websites.

We take reasonable steps to not collect or pass to 3rd parties pages and data regarding medical conditions; certain aspects of personal life or financial situations; gambling; alcoholic beverages; violence, or "adult" products or services.

We identify users by simply recognizing tokens (cookies) stored in users' browsers by us or one of our partners. With this information, we may show ads related to the interests associated with those cookies. Kontera's advertising products collects this information only from websites on which our advertising products are enabled.

Additionally, we may engage with certain 3rd parties that provide additional information on demographics, geography, and interest areas that we may leverage in selecting ads to display to consumers.

Although we may share our data with 3rd party service providers to deliver Kontera advertising campaigns, we do not authorize any of these partiers to resell or further share this data. These 3rd parties work on our behalf only to support the delivery of our advertising campaigns. When we work with them, we will provide the data specified above. From time to time we may turn off the collection of any data.  

If you prefer that Kontera not collect any information about your website visits for the purpose of delivering targeted advertising, you may opt out by [clicking here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

We may also work with partners that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and work with industry-leading companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards in online advertising. [Click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) to learn more about the NAI. To opt-out of targeting by other member companies, please [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

When you opt out, an opt-out cookie will be placed onto your computer. The opt-out cookie tells Kontera not to use any of your information for delivering relevant online advertisements. Please note that if you block cookies, the opt-out process may not function properly. Please also note that if you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you will need to set your opt-out choice again for that computer or browser.
