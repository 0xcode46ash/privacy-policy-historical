_By using the Sites (as defined below), or otherwise providing your personally identifiable information to Konami, you consent to the collection and use of such personally identifiable information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not provide us with any information and do not use the Sites._

Konami Digital Entertainment, Inc. ("Konami") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the information collected from you. To further this commitment, we have adopted this Privacy Policy to describe how we collect, use, safeguard and disclose the information you provide to Konami. This policy may be revised from time to time, so please revisit this page often to remain fully informed of our policies. 

This Privacy Policy and the certification seal located on this page confirms that Konami is a valid licensee and participating member in the Entertainment Software Rating Board's Privacy Online Program: ESRB Privacy Online. To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative and all the Sites have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Online to meet established online information collection and use practices. As part of this privacy program, we are subject to frequent audits of the Sites and other enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by the ESRB. 

ESRB Privacy Online is a third-party seal provider whose mission is to protect consumers' online privacy and make the Internet a secure, reliable, and private place to share information and conduct business. ESRB Privacy Online promotes and enforces established principles and guidelines for fair information practices that include requirements of full disclosure, notice, and informed consent. 

Whenever you visit a website or page that displays the ESRB Privacy Online certification seal, you can expect to be notified of the following: 

  * The websites, pages and information covered by the Privacy Policy; 
  * Exactly what information may be collected and how it will be used; 
  * The consequences, if any, resulting from your refusal to provide personally identifiable information; 
  * Whether a company uses cookies, tracks IP addresses, or uses other passive means to collect technical information; 
  * Who, if anyone, is collecting your personally identifiable information; 
  * With whom, if anyone, is your personally identifiable information shared; 
  * What a company's policy is regarding links to third party sites; 
  * What choices you have with regard to the use of your personally identifiable information; 
  * How you can access, and if necessary, change the personally identifiable information a company collects and maintains; 
  * How a company ensures data security, quality, and integrity; and 
  * Where and how to ask questions or file complaints. 



**The websites, pages and information covered by this Privacy Policy:**   
This Privacy Policy currently applies to: (a) the website located at [www.konami.com](http://www.konami.com/); (b) all related Konami-controlled websites; (c) our pages on social media websites such as Facebook, Twitter and Google+ (the " **Social Media Pages** "); and (d) any software applications that we make available through the Social Media Pages (collectively, the foregoing items (a) through (d) shall be referred to as the " **Sites** "). Downloadable interactive mobile applications are also covered by this Privacy Policy and unless discussed separately below, shall be included in the definition of "Sites". 

Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any websites or pages other than the Sites, including any such websites or pages to which we link. Konami is not responsible for the content or activities provided on such websites or pages, and we recommend that you independently review the privacy policies posted on such websites or pages. This Privacy Policy does not govern the collection, use or disclosure of information by any third party, including without limitation social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Google+ or third party service providers such as Apple, Google or mobile service providers. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DATA COLLECTION, USAGE AND DISCLOSURE POLICIES AND PRACTICES OF SOCIAL MEDIA SITES OR ANY OTHER THIRD PARTY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE USE OF ANY INFORMATION THAT YOU DISCLOSE TO SOCIAL MEDIA SITES (OR THAT SOCIAL MEDIA SITES COLLECT) THROUGH OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES OR THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS THROUGH OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROVIDER'S SERVICES. 

Some jurisdictions also may require notice concerning personally identifiable information collected offline; for those jurisdictions, this Privacy Policy also explains our practices regarding personally identifiable information that we obtain from offline sources, such as written or verbal communications.

**What types of information does Konami collect and how will it be used?**   
Konami may collect information about you when you use the Sites or our products or services, or when you otherwise provide personally identifiable information to us. For example, we may obtain personally identifiable information through: (1) "community" registration (e.g., registration for online games or tournaments, to participate in forums or chat rooms, to receive ongoing marketing or other information, etc.); (2) product registration; (3) email correspondence with product support/customer service; (4) polls or surveys; (5) E-Cards or "Send-to-a-Friend" emails; (6) the Social Media Pages; (7) software applications that we make available through the Social Media Pages and/or mobile services/application; and/or (8) information submitted in a business capacity (e.g., resumes). The types of information that may be requested for each activity and the way the information may be used are detailed below. 

ยง Community Registration   
If you choose to register on the Sites, you will be required to provide your first and last name, city, state, zip code, country of residence, email address, date of birth, age, occupation and a user name and password. In addition, you may be asked to provide other information, such as your phone number, the provision of which is optional. The information that you submit during registration will: (a) make up your profile; (b) allow you to use our message board and participate in other activities on the Sites (e.g., contests and sweepstakes, or game-specific events); and (3) allow us to send you, via email, news about products, features and enhancements, special offers, upgrade opportunities, and contents and events of interest.   
Please note that the information (e.g., email address, username, occupation, and interests) contained in your profile (i.e., that you provide when registering) may be viewable to other users of Konami's message board. We cannot and do not guarantee that this information will be kept confidential or private. If you choose, you may omit from your profile certain information that you do not want the public to see by leaving such information blank at the time of registration, or choosing to make your email address not accessible via such message boards. 

ยง Product Registration   
To register a Konami product on the Sites, you will be required to submit your first and last name, city, state, zip code, country of residence, email address, date of birth, age and occupation. You may also be asked to provide your phone number and answer demographic questions relating to your age, information about the product you purchased, the type of console you own, and the types of games you enjoy playing. The information that you submit during product registration will entitle you to limited warranty protection and technical support. **** **Unless you opt out at the time of registration, we may also use your registration information to send you, via email, news about products, features and enhancements, special offers, upgrade opportunities, and contents and events of interest. You may also choose to opt out at any time from receiving these messages, as described below.** ****

ยง Customer Support   
Konami may collect, use and store personally identifiable information that you voluntarily submit to us via email or other means when contacting Konami customer service or support. For example, we may provide on the Sites a link through which an online visitor can send e-mail to customer service addressing any issue a user encounters with a Konami product. Your email address and any personally identifiable information you choose to provide in the body of such email is used by Konami for purposes of addressing and responding to your question. Although most e-mail messages are deleted immediately after they are responded to, in certain cases, hard copies or data from certain e-mail correspondence may be kept on file for security or other business purposes, and even deleted emails may remain archived or in system backups. Any such copy or data will be stored in a secure location, and information from these messages will not be used for marketing purposes. **** Any email addresses collected from you during the use of the E-Cards or "Send-to-a-Friend" email feature on any Site are not retained by Konami, and are only used to send a one-time email notification on your behalf. 

ยง Polls/Surveys   
From time to time, we may ask you for your opinion about certain matters in the form of online or offline polls or surveys, including your opinion with respect to our games or other products and services. Your responses to these polls help us provide products and services of interest to you. While we may ask for certain demographic or other information in connection with such polls or surveys to allow us to better interpret the results, we do not request personally identifiable information, such as your name, in connection with these polls or surveys. 

ยง Social Media Pages   
You do not have to provide personally identifiable information to use the Social Media Pages. However, in order for you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided through the Social Media Pages (for example, contests, sweepstakes, events, games or other applications), we may require that you furnish personally identifiable information. We and our third-party service providers collect such information from you through the Social Media Pages, including your name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, Facebook and other social media IDs and the names of your friends, only when voluntarily provided to us (either directly or indirectly as a result of Facebook or other social media site being authorized to submit such information to us). Such information may be used and disclosed for any purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy. Konami also collects other information (such as your gender, social media networks, workplace, geographic location, application settings and statistics, status updates, user interactions and other non-personally identifiable information) when you voluntarily provide such information to us (either directly or indirectly as a result of Facebook or other social media sites being authorized to submit such information to us). Unless otherwise noted, we may share, use and disclose such information for any purpose in our discretion. 

ยง Mobile Services and Applications 

Certain of our mobile services and/or applications may require that you furnish personally identifiable information by downloading the application to your mobile device. We and third-party service providers collect such information from you through your mobile device, including your name, user name, profile pictures, telephone number, device identifiers, e-mail address, contacts, GPS location, browser history, chat or messaging activity, application linked friends and Apple Game Center ID. Certain collection of information may be disabled or limited in specific applications in the user settings. Such information may be used and disclosed for any purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy. Konami also collects other non-personally identifiable information. Unless otherwise noted, we may share, use and disclose such non-personally identifiable information for any purpose in our discretion. 

ยง Candidates for Employment   
Konami may provide on the Sites an email address that visitors can use to send us their resumes. In the future we may expand functionality on the Sites for other similar business uses. We also may collect personally identifiable information offline about candidates for employment. Personally identifiable information about candidates will be used for the purpose of accepting and evaluating candidate submissions for job postings and may therefore be shared within our company. If the candidate becomes an employee, this information also may be used and retained for employment purposes. Other than as explained in this paragraph, this Privacy Policy does not apply to personally identifiable information gathered concerning job applicants or candidates for employment. 

ยง Passive Collection   
As noted below, (see "Does Konami use cookie, track IP addresses or use other passive means to collect information?"), we use certain passive means to collect information regarding visitors to the Sites, Sites traffic patterns and Sites usage. Unless noted otherwise, we may share, use and disclose such information, as well as aggregated information or other non-personal information, for any purpose in our discretion. 

ยง Other Uses of Personally Identifiable Information   
We may also use your personally identifiable and demographic information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the products and services we provide you and to better meet your needs. From time to time, we are approached by third-party companies and organizations that provide products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. To extend these products or services to you, we may use your personally identifiable information to send out notices on their behalf. We strive to limit the notices and communications to those that we think you would appreciate receiving. 

Your personally identifiable information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and by using the Sites, you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside your country of residence, including the United States, which may have different data protection rules than in your country. 

**No matter what method we use to collect information and no matter how we use that information, we seek only to collect the information that we believe is reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives.**

**What happens if I refuse to provide my personally identifiable information to Konami?**   
If you choose not to submit personally identifiable information when requested, you may not be able to participate in certain activities on the Sites which may considerably limit the services we can provide you. For example, if you refuse to provide your email address when registering, you will not be able to use our message boards.

**Does Konami use cookies, track IP addresses or use other passive means to collect information?**

_Cookies_   
Konami may collect information through cookies to improve the use of the Sites. A "cookie" is a small string of text sent by the Sites to your browser and then stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Storage of cookies on your system provides an easy and convenient method for us to personalize and enhance your experience on the Sites, and to help us diagnose problems with our servers and to administer the Sites. For example, cookies allow us to remember your screen name and date of birth, tell us that you have visited the Sites before, track your usage of the Sites, and may contain information that will make your next visit to the Sites more enjoyable. In addition, Konami will not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can always disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer. However, rejecting cookies may prevent you from taking advantage of certain portions of the Sites. 

_Third Party Cookies_   
We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use the Sites. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by our marketing company on the Sites. We may collect the following types of information through such third party cookies: the activity of the Sites' visitors' browsers when the visitors are viewing the Sites; the website path of visitors; the time visitors come to the Sites; and product codes and pricing information for merchandise that visitors purchase via the Sites. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our marketing company logs the information coming from the Sites on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve the Sites and our products, offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt-out" of our ability to analyze such data by [clicking here](http://www.infoyouaskedfor.com/u.php?m=52288). 

_IP Addresses_   
While you are browsing the Sites, Konami automatically collects your IP address and your activity while using the Sites. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet. 

_Log Files_   
Konami also collects information in the form of log files that record activity on the Sites, including how many "hits" a particular web page is getting (a.k.a. "click-through data"). For example, log file entries are generated every time a visitor clicks an image on the Sites. These entries enable Konami to assess overall site activity, track interest in particular portions of the Sites, troubleshoot technical concerns, and identify the type of browser you are using. We may also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the products and services we provide you. Log files are used internally only.

**Who is collecting my personally identifiable information?**   
The information that you disclose to us while visiting any of the Sites or by downloading a mobile application is collected by Konami, a third party service provider or one of its vendors on Konami's behalf, and is used in the manner specified above. PLEASE BE AWARE THAT CERTAIN INFORMATION THAT YOU MAY DISCLOSE ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES IS DISCLOSED TO (AND/OR COLLECTED BY) THE APPLICABLE SOCIAL MEDIA SITE, AND NOT BY KONAMI OR ON KONAMI'S BEHALF. SIMILARLY, CERTAIN INFORMATION THAT YOU MAY DISCLOSE IN THE MOBILE APPLICATIONS IS DISCLOSED TO (AND/OR COLLECTED BY) THE APPLICABLE MOBILE SERVICE PROVIDER AND/OR APPLICATION DOWNLOAD PORTAL (I.E., APPLE AND/OR GOOGLE). WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DATA COLLECTION, USAGE AND DISCLOSURE POLICIES AND PRACTICES OF SUCH SOCIAL MEDIA SITES AND THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE USE OF ANY INFORMATION THAT YOU DISCLOSE TO SUCH SOCIAL MEDIA SITES (OR THAT SUCH SOCIAL MEDIA SITES COLLECT) OR THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER THROUGH OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES OR THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER SERVICES (E.G., GAME CENTER).

You should be aware that while you are on the Sites, Konami may reference or provide links to third party sites. Konami does not control, nor are we responsible for, the privacy policies or information practices of such third parties or their websites.

**What safeguards does Konami use to protect my personally identifiable information?**

Konami maintains appropriate safeguards that ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the personally identifiable information we collect from our users. Personally identifiable information collected by Konami is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public and is only accessible by authorized employees. We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control (i.e., maintain data quality).

Nonetheless, please be aware that Internet data transmission is not always secure and we cannot warrant or guarantee that information you transmit utilizing the Sites is secure.
