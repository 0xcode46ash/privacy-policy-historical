KOB-TV, LLC and its parent company Hubbard Broadcasting, Inc. have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.

**Information Collection and Use**  
We collect information from Web site visitors who must register for certain services on-line, from users who agree to participate in on-line surveys, from users who wish to make certain on-line information requests from us and from users who wish to participate in on-line contests and promotions sponsored by us. Because participation in these activities is completely voluntary, the user has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The type of information so requested or collected by us includes user contact information (like their name and email address) and user demographic information (like gender or age). Contact information will be used to notify contest winners and award prizes and, in some instances may be shared with the contest or survey sponsor. Anonymous survey information will be used for purposes of reporting survey results and monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Users' personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and choice. The visitor's contact information will be used to contact the visitor when the visitor has expressed interest in being contacted (visitors can opt-out of receiving future mailings by complying with the choice/output requirements noted below).

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. We track and record IP addresses that access our site for reporting and profiling purposes only. We may also share personally identifiable user information if requested to do so by subpoena or with governmental authorities when subpoenaed to do so or as part of an investigation into illegal activities, such as, but not limited to illegal transfer of copyrighted material, or user Web site postings or email messages that contain threats of violence.

We may also disclose personally identifiable information in other cases where we have reason to believe that disclosure is necessary to enforce compliance with our [Terms of Use](http://www.kob.com/article/stories/s1834767.shtml). Other than these specific exceptions noted, we do not sell, rent or provide access to any data collected about or from our users.
