# KOBTV.com - KOBTV.com Privacy Statement

KOBTV.com may collect and store information, personal or otherwise, that users voluntarily supply to us. We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as users navigate through our website. 

Unless the user informs us otherwise, KOBTV.com reserves the right to use and to disclose to third party vendors user information (e.g., user name and e-mail address) for purposes such as providing users with information about promotions, events, products and services. If the user does not wish to be included in such uses, the user must send an e-mail or a letter requesting to be taken off any lists of information that may be used for these purposes or given or sold to third party vendors. In addition, please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others. 

**Children’s Privacy Statement**  
This children’s privacy statement explains our practices with respect to the online collection and use of personal information from children under the age of thirteen, and provides important information on your rights under federal law with respect to such information.

We do NOT knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. We screen users who wish to provide personal information in order to prevent users under the age of thirteen from providing such information. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally-identifiable information from a user under the age of thirteen, we will delete such information from our records. If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen.

Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen, we also do NOT knowingly distribute such information to third parties.

We do NOT knowingly allow children under the age of thirteen to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information.

Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen, we do NOT condition the participation in online activities of a child under thirteen on providing personally identifiable information.
