**How We Respect Your Right To Privacy**   
Our Web server does not automatically recognize information regarding the domain or e-mail address of individual visitors. We do collect non-personal and personal information under the following circumstances:

  * **Non-Personally Identifiable Information Collected Automatically**   
For the purposes of analyzing site traffic and improving Kohl's Website, we anonymously track the path our visitors take when visiting the various pages of our Website. 
  * **Personally Identifiable Information**  
Kohl's does collect e-mail address, postal address, telephone number payment-related data and other personal information volunteered by visitors/customers such as survey information, and site registrations. The information we collect is used for internal review and is either discarded or used by customer service representatives to contact consumers, process orders, address questions/requests or for marketing purposes such as those described below: 
  * **E-mail address**   
If you provide us with your e-mail address online, you may receive periodic e-mail messages from us with information on sales, new products and services, or upcoming events. If you do not want to receive e-mail from Kohl's, please contact us at the e-mail address [remove@kohls.com](mailto:remove@kohls.com). Please provide your e-mail address, and specify that you want Kohl's to discontinue e-mail messages to you. 
  * **Postal Address**   
If you provide us with your postal address online, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information on sales, new products and services, or upcoming events. If you do not want to receive such mailings, please contact us at the e-mail address [remove@kohls.com](mailto:remove@kohls.com). Please provide your exact name and address and specify that you want Kohl's to discontinue postal mailings to you. 
  * **Telephone Number**  
If you provide us with your telephone number online, you may receive telephone calls from us regarding information you have volunteered online. We will not use this information for telemarketing purposes, nor will this information be shared with other organizations. 



**Our Security Standards**   
We protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information you provide before it travels over the Internet. SSL technology is the industry standard for secure online transactions. Because we use SSL, placing an order online for our **Corporate Gift Card and/or Fundraising Gift Card** at kohls.com is as safe as giving your personal and payment information to us over the phone. 

**Online Shopping Security& Privacy**   
Currently, our Website does not offer the ability to order merchandise online because we won't settle for anything less than an online shopping experience that is as convenient, secure and as hassle-free as shopping one of our brick-and-mortar locations. When we launch an online store, we will address any issues and how we'll guarantee a safe shopping experience at [www.kohls.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20010614212613id_/http%3A//www.kohls.com/index.html). Please continue to visit our site to watch for updates. 

If you have additional questions about Kohl's Privacy & Security policy, contact us via e-mail at [webmaster@kohls.com](mailto:webmaster@kohls.com).
