# Privacy Policy

## Koders Privacy Policy

At Black Duck Software we respect your right to privacy. We understand that as a visitor to one our web sites (www.blackducksoftware.com and www.koders.com) (each a "Web Site"), you prefer to control your own personal information preferences. For this reason, we may ask you to register or provide personal information and preferences when you visit certain areas of our Web Sites, download free software, upload software for our search engine, request information, register for events, register new products, subscribe to company newsletters, or use our message forums. 

We will guard the personal information you share with us to ensure that the content and services we provide on our Web Sites are always tailored to your current, designated preferences. 

When you provide Black Duck Software with your name, email address, mailing address, or telephone number, and you don't "opt out", we may use this information to alert you to company news, new services and other company and product information. We don't sell any user-provided information to third parties.

If you don't want Black Duck Software or Black Duck Software representatives to contact you, you may "opt-out" of this preference at any time, whether you're online or contacting Black Duck Software directly. You'll always have the flexibility to opt back in at any time based on previous information or newly updated information. See the "How to update your personal information" section for further information. 

### Collecting other personal information

When you browse our Web Sites, you can do so anonymously. Generally, we don't collect personal information when you browse - not even your email address. However, your browser automatically tells us the type of computer and operating system you're using. 

Like most standard web servers, our Web Sites use log files and cookies. A "cookie" is a small line of text that is stored with your Web browser for record-keeping purposes and helps Black Duck Software provide better service to you. Your browser has an option to accept, reject or provide you with notice when a cookie is sent. 

As you visit our Web Sites, a cookie follows as you navigate the site, collecting information including internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, number of clicks, and similar information. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' overall movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use only, to help us understand what users are seeking on our Web Sites. We may share this information with third parties for the purpose of processing and trend analysis. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information, and personal information about you is not collected or shared as a result of this process. 

For certain Web Site functions, such as the purchase of a product or service or create an account for using our message forums,, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and address) and, where applicable, financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. We do not retain credit card data without your express authorization.

### How we protect your personal information

When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the sensitive information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Black Duck Software will always protect the personal information that you share with us. Black Duck Software stores information internally in a controlled, secure environment. We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. 

If Black Duck Software requests general demographic information, this information is limited to reporting purposes only; users remain anonymous. Phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and postal addresses are never shared for demographic reports with outside entities. Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law when we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on one of our Web Sites. 

### How to update your personal information

You can help Black Duck Software maintain the accuracy of your personal information by notifying us when you change your name, address, title, phone number, e-mail address or your content preferences. If at any time you wish to update your information or preferences, or you prefer to stop receiving communication from Black Duck Software, feel free to contact us at any time.

### Links

Our Web Sites may contain links to other web sites. Black Duck Software assumes no responsibility for the content or the privacy policies and practices of such web sites. Black Duck Software encourages you to read the privacy statements of these linked sites; their privacy practices may differ from ours.

### Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

If we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their accounts, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes to our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web Sites notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.

### Business Transitions

If Black Duck Software undergoes a business transition such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. If as a result of the business transition, users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section.
