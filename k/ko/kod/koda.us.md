By continuing to use the KODA service after notice of changes have been sent to you or published on the KODA website, you are consenting to the changes. 

Please read this privacy policy to learn more about:

  1. **Personal Information Collected**

You willingly provide us certain personal information, which we collect in order to allow you to benefit from the KODA website. If you have any hesitation about providing such information to us and/or having such information displayed on the KODA website or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, you should not become a member of the KODA community. We collect your personal information in the following ways: Registration: In order to become a User, you must first create an account on our website. To create an account you are required to provide the following contact information, which you recognize and expressly acknowledge is personal information allowing others, including KODA, to identify you: name, email address, country, ZIP/ postal code, a brief summary of your professional background, and a password chosen by you. 

Profile Information: Once you become a User, you may provide additional information in the Profile section describing your skills, professional experiences, and objectives. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration to become a User is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself and find new opportunities in the KODA system to build and leverage your professional network. Any information you provide at registration or in the Profile section that is not personally identifiable may be used in the same manner and extent to which other information that is not personally identifiable is permitted to be used hereunder, including for the purpose of serving advertisements through the service. If you opt-out you may lose the potential benefit of being a User, including receiving ads that are more targeted to your interests. 

Customer Service: KODA may collect information through the KODA website or through the Customer Service website in order to, among other things, accurately categorize and respond to a customer's inquiry and deliver appropriate service levels. 

Cookies: Like most websites, KODA uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows KODA to recognize you as a User when you return to the KODA website using the same computer and web browser. If your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use the KODA website. Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on our website. 

One type of cookie, known as a "persistent" cookie, is set once you've logged in to your KODA account. The next time you visit the KODA website, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing User so you will not need to log in before using the service. In order to access or change any of your private information (like a credit card number) or to send a message to another User, however, you must log in securely again with your password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie. Additionally, if you log out of the KODA website you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. Another type of cookie, called a "session" cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the KODA website. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser. 

We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing User preferences and tracking User trends. In the course of serving advertisements or optimizing services to our Users, we may allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Any information provided to third parties through such cookies will not be personally identifiable but may provide general segment information, e.g. your industry or geographic location, your occupation, or information about your professional or educational background, for greater customization of your user experience. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies or you opt to refuse all cookies, you may not be able to use the KODA website or services. KODA does not store personally identifiable information in the cookies. 

Log files, IP addresses and information about your computer: Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the KODA web site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave KODA. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, email patterns, as well as the name of your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the KODA service. The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is not shared with third-parties without your permission or except when required by law. 

Consent to KODA Processing Information About You: Certain information you provide to KODA may reveal, or allow others to identify, your nationality, ethnic origin, religion or other aspects of your private life, and more generally about you. Please be aware that in providing information to KODA for the purposes of opening your user account, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and KODA's User Agreement. The supplying of all such information by you to KODA, including all information deemed "sensitive" by applicable law, is entirely voluntary on your part. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, but please note that your withdrawal of consent will not be retroactive. 

Rights to Access, Correct and Eliminate Information About You: You have a right to access, modify, correct and eliminate the data about you which has been collected pursuant to your decision to become a User. If you update any of your information, we may keep a copy of the information which you originally provided to us in our archives for uses documented herein. 

We take your rights seriously and encourage you to use them if you deem this to be appropriate. You may exercise these rights by emailing us at privacy@koda.us or by contacting us at: 

KODA Corporation Attn: Privacy Policy Issues 220 Montgomery Street, #991 San Francisco, CA 94104 United States of America 
  2. **Uses of personal information**

KODA is an online service dedicated to helping all types of professionals more effectively connect with one another. The personally identifiable information you choose to provide on our website is used to help you describe yourself to other Users. Other information, that does not personally identify you as an individual, is collected by KODA from Users (such as, for example, patterns of utilization) and is exclusively owned by KODA. This information can be utilized by KODA in such manner as KODA, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate. 

KODA Communications: KODA will communicate with you through email and notices posted on the KODA website or through other means available through the service, including text and other forms of messaging. If we send any communications to you via the carrier service with which you have a mobile communications subscription or otherwise have access, you understand you will pay any service fees associated with any such access (including text messaging charges for messages to your mobile device). These include a series of up to five welcome emails which help inform new Users about various features of the service. Please be aware that you will always receive certain emails from KODA related to the proper functioning of your account, such as email notices when another User in your network sends you an opportunity. KODA may send you promotional information unless you have opted out of receiving such information. You can change your e-mail and contact preferences at any time by logging into your 'Account & Settings' and amending your email notification choices. If you wish, you can also opt-out of receiving promotional emails, by sending a request to customerservice@koda.us 

Customized Content: Information provided to KODA (or to third parties with whom it offers combined services) is also used to customize your experience on our website. For example, when you login to your account we will display the screen names of new Users who have recently joined your network. 

Sharing Information with Third Parties: KODA takes the privacy of Users very seriously. We do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to third parties for marketing purposes. We will only share your personally identifiable information with third parties to carry out your instructions or to provide specific services or information. 

We may provide aggregated anonymous data about the usage of our services to third parties for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate, including to prospective advertisers on KODA. We may segment our Users by role (i.e. product managers, vice presidents), industry, geographic location, or company. If you would like to be excluded from the aggregated research or products based upon aggregated data about our Users' activities on the site, please contact us. 

Teaming with Other Organizations to Offer Combined and Other Services: KODA may offer our services in connection with other websites (including updates about the KODA service) or may team with other online services to give you the combined results of both services or additional services and benefits. Platform Applications (as defined in the User Agreement) can be designed by Platform Developers (as defined in the User Agreement) or by a subset of Platform Developers with whom KODA has more closely aligned ("Partners"). 

In the case of Partners, we do some vetting and we only work with trusted Partners. Because of KODA's trust in these Partners or services designed by a Partner may be automatically granted permission to access account information to provide the combined services. 

Surveys and Polls: As a User, you will receive requests to participate in market research including polls and surveys submitted by other KODA members. If you participate in surveys and polls offered through our website, the information you provide may be visible to others using the KODA website. You may opt-out of participating by changing your Account & Settings to stop receiving these inquiries and requests. 

Testimonials: If you provide any testimonials about the KODA service, we may post those testimonials you place in connection with KODA's promotion of its service to third parties, which testimonials may include your name and other personal information that you have provided. 

Communications to other Users: Many emails you initiate through KODA, e.g., an invitation sent to a non-User, will list your email address and name in the header of the message. Emails you initiate may also provide aggregate information about your network (for instance how many people are in your network), but will not list the people to whom you're directly connected. Your contact information will only be shared with another User if both of you have indicated that you would like to establish contact with each other. 

Legal Disclaimer: It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information when required by law, such as responses to civil or criminal subpoenas, or other requests by law enforcement personnel. We will disclose such information wherein we have a good- faith belief that it is necessary to comply with a court order, ongoing judicial proceeding, subpoena, or other legal process or request to KODA brought in any country throughout the world, or to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. Disclosures to others: We may also disclose your personal and other information you provide, to another third party as part of a reorganization or a sale of the assets of a KODA corporation division or company. Any third party to which we transfer or sell KODA's assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide to us. 

  3. **Your Information Choices**

Accessing and Changing Your Account Information: You can review the personal information you provided us and make any desired changes to the information you publish, or to the settings for your KODA account including your email, and contact preferences, at any time by logging in to your account on the KODA website. Please be aware that even after your request for a change is processed, KODA may, for a time, retain residual information about you in its backup and/or archival copies of its database. 

Closing Your Account: You can also close your account through the KODA website. If you close your KODA account, we will remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our publicly viewable database. We may retain certain data contributed by you if we believe it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non- personally identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law. To request that we close your account and remove your information from the KODA website, please send your request to customerservice@koda.us . Please send your request using an email account that you have registered with KODA under your name. You will receive a response to requests sent to customerservice@koda.us within five business days of its receipt. 

  4. **Your Obligations**

As a User, you have certain obligations toward the other Users with whom you will be communicating. Certain of these obligations are imposed by applicable law and regulations, and others have become commonplace in user-friendly communities of like- minded members, such as KODA: 

    * You must, at all times, respect the terms and conditions of the then-current Privacy Policy and the User Agreement. This includes respecting all intellectual property rights which may belong to third parties (such as photographs). 
    * You must not download or otherwise disseminate any information which may be deemed to be injurious, violent, offensive, racist or xenophobic or which may otherwise violate the purpose and spirit of KODA and its community of Users. 
    * You must not provide information to KODA and /or other Users which you believe might be injurious or detrimental to your person, professional or social status. Any violation of these guidelines may lead to the restriction, suspension or termination of your account by KODA, as we take these principles seriously and consider them to be the basis on which our Users adhere to the KODA website and the services which it offers. 
  5. **Important Information**

Children: Children are not eligible to use our service and we ask that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us or use the service. Changes to this Privacy Policy: KODA may update this privacy policy at any time, with or without advance notice. In the event there are significant changes in the way we treat your personally identifiable information, we will display a notice on the KODA website or send you an email, as provided for above. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account. If you use the KODA service after notice of changes have been sent to you or published on our site, you hereby provide your consent to the changed practices. 

  6. **Security**

In order to secure your personal information, access to your data on KODA is password- protected, and sensitive data (such as credit card information) is protected by SSL encryption when it is exchanged between your web browser and the KODA web site. To protect any data you store on our servers we also regularly audit our system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and we use a tier-one secured-access data center. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information. Please note that emails and instant messaging and similar means of communication with other users of KODA are not encrypted and we strongly request you not to communicate any confidential information through these means.
