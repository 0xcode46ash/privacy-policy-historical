## Safety of credit card usage and data

Shopping at KOOLSKOOL  is 100% safe. Credit card payments, internet banking and other payments are processed through the Axis Bank  payment gateway and CCAvenue.

Both our providers use the latest encryption technology to protect your credit card information. It encrypts your credit card number so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet.

Furthermore, both the providers ask you to enter the CVV (Credit Verification Value) number on your credit card. This is a 3 digit number which follows your credit card number and is given at the back of the card to ensure that the person entering the card number has the physical plastic card with him/her. In addition to this both Mastercard and Visa have their own verification process which is integrated with our payment mechanism.

You can be assured that KOOLSKOOL offers you the highest standards of security currently available on the internet so as to ensure that your shopping experience is private, safe and secure.

## Storage of Credit Card Information

KOOLSKOOL does not collect or store your credit card/bank account information at all. Axis Bank/CCAvenue authorizes the transaction directly without any information passing through us.
