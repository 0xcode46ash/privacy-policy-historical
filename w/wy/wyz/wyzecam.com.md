# Privacy Policy | Wyze

[](https://www.wyzecam.com/) [__ ](https://www.wyzecam.com/cart/)

[ ](https://www.wyzecam.com/)

Please read this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to learn more about the manner in which we collect and use information that is generated when you visit www.wyzecam.com and affiliated sites, including the Wyze App (the “ **Site** ”).

If you visit the Site and/or choose to create an account and/or place an order with us, we have designed our system to protect your privacy. Our system will be able to ascertain your geographic location from your IP (Internet Protocol) address, but we do not collect e-mail addresses or track the sites that you access while you use our services unless:

  * we are required to do so by law
  * we have reason to believe that you have violated the terms and conditions of the Wyze Labs, Inc. Terms of Use
  * you have caused or attempted to cause harm to us or the other users of our Site
  * you voluntarily provide us with personal information (as described below)



Two types of information may be collected when you visit our Site:

  * **Personal information** (such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, password, or credit card information), which is only collected by us if you voluntarily submit it to us. For example, if you voluntarily place an order on the Site, we use the information we collect to confirm and process your order, to keep you updated on the status of your order, and to respond to any questions you may have. In each case, Wyze Labs, Inc. collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with the Site. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities, such as login, purchase, and interaction. If you voluntarily create an account with us on our Site, we will receive the account information you submit so that we may better ensure that you receive streamlined service, custom discounts, faster checkout, order history, and other products, information and/or services you explicitly request. Where required, we also share this information with certain intermediaries (such as freight carriers, shipping companies and product manufacturers) to process and ship your order.

  * **Aggregate/Analytics information** (such as log files/information about how many visitors log on to the Site and other non-identifying statistics), which is automatically collected from your use of the Site. Our servers will log IP addresses and collect third-party sites (and information from these sites) from your use of the Site. Wyze Labs, Inc. uses this information to measure the use of our Site, to improve the content of our Site, and to provide our users with the best possible services. Our Site may also use your IP address to help identify you and your shopping cart.




In sum, you can visit our Site without telling us who you are or revealing personal information about yourself. However, you can, if you choose, participate in additional secured applications. For access to these applications, you are required to create an account with us or provide personal information when placing an order or logging into your user-interface. If you place an order and/or create an account with us, we may also, from time to time, send you information about special offers, new products and services, system changes and updates, and other information we think may be of interest. If for any reason you do not wish to receive this information, you may reply to any of our e-mails and type “unsubscribe” in the subject line or send an email to our customer service email to opt out. You may opt out of receiving future e-mails at any time.

Wyze Labs, Inc. does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide services that you have requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

  * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.

  * We may transfer information about you if Wyze Labs, Inc. is acquired by or merged with another organization. In this event, Wyze Labs, Inc. will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

  * We may share information collected from your use of the Site or the purchases you make with whom we have marketing or other business relationships, in order to further improve/increase our services and customer base.

  * We share information with certain intermediaries (such as freight carriers, shipping companies and product manufacturers) where required to process and ship your order.
