# Privacy Policy - ResortQuest by Wyndham Vacation Rentals

Welcome to the **Wyndham Vacation Rentals** North America website ( **"Website"** ), controlled and operated by the following entities: The Resort Company, LLC and Wyndham Vacation Rentals North America, LLC.  For purposes of this Website, the entities mentioned above are collectively referred to as “ **WVR** ”.  WVR recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of certain Information collected about the users and visitors (" **user** ," " **you** " or " **your** ") of WVR's website (" **Website** "). This Privacy Statement discloses and describes what Information WVR may gather about you, how WVR may use such Information, to whom it may be disclosed, and how you can correct or change such Information (" **Privacy Statement** "). This Privacy Statement is designed to give you an understanding about how WVR collects your Information and the uses WVR may make of such Information during the course of WVR's business and in providing you with access to the information, products and services that may be available at this Website. 

In this Privacy Statement, "Personal Information" means any information about you from which you can be personally identified, including, without limitation, your name, address, telephone number, email address, financial details, username, password and other information which you may disclose.  Certain capitalized terms used in this Privacy Statement may be defined in WVR's separate Website Terms and Conditions.

**YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT**

By using this Website, you signify your agreement to the terms of WVR's Internet Privacy Statement. **IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT, PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE.**  Please print a copy of this Privacy Statement for your records.  Please note, however, that WVR may update and amend this Privacy Statement from time to time, as it deems necessary in its sole discretion.  Your continued use of WVR's Website following the posting of any updates or changes to this Privacy Statement’s terms will signify your acceptance of those updates and changes. 

**Purpose**

WVR's purpose in establishing this Privacy Statement is to balance its legitimate business interests in collecting and using its users' Information with their reasonable expectations of privacy. WVR's intent is to provide its users certain offers, information, services and discounts that it believes are relevant to their interests. WVR believes its users will benefit from promotional activity based on certain information employed to market goods and services offered by and through its businesses. 

**Affiliate Websites**

This Privacy Statement applies to this Website and WVR entities’ operations only. To the extent you link from this Website to sites of WVR's affiliated or related entities, or its providers, separate privacy policies and terms apply to those sites that may be different from this Privacy Statement. **Your access to and use of such linked sites are exclusively  governed by their privacy policies, and WVR disclaims any and all responsibility for your access to and use of such linked sites, including for any use of the Information you provide to those linked sites, or that they collect about you.**

**What Information Does WVR Collect?**

WVR gathers three types of Information about its users: (1) data users provide through optional, voluntary registration on WVR's Website; (2) data from third party sources or providers; and (3) data gathered through aggregated anonymous tracking of use activity and trends, mainly by tallying  user page views on this Website. You should be assured, however, that WVR will not disclose any of your Personal Information (as defined above) to third parties without your consent, except as may otherwise be described in this Privacy Statement or disclosed to you when you submit the Personal Information.

Where you provide information that relates to a person other than yourself, you must ensure it is lawful for you to do so, and that if required, you have obtained that person’s permission.  WVR will also use their information as described in this Privacy Statement. 

**How Does WVR Collect Information?**

**Optional Registration:**

WVR collects Information by specifically requesting it from you. Generally, this occurs when you register at the Website, make a reservation, request information about a service or product or subscribe to any WVR communications. You may elect, at your sole option, whether to provide the requested Information, although you may not be able to use or gain access to certain portions or features of this Website if you elect not to provide it. Usually, WVR and/or its business partners use your Information to operate the Website and deliver information and products and services to you. WVR also uses your Information to inform you about other products and/or services available from WVR, its affiliated or related entities, and/or its providers.

**Information from Third Party Sources:**

WVR may collect information about you from third party sources to supplement the Information you provided at this Website. This allows WVR to verify the Information you provided and to enhance WVR's ability to provide you with information about its businesses, products and services, as further described in WVR's Website Terms. WVR's agreements with these third party sources typically limit how WVR may use this supplemental information.

**Use of Aggregate Tracking Information:**

_Internet Protocol ("IP") Addresses_ :  An IP address is a unique number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are browsing the Internet so that your computer can be identified by the main computers, known as "Web servers," that "serve up" websites and pages. This IP address allows WVR to identify and gather general information and data about users, such as the pages that users may view.

WVR collects IP addresses to: (1) help WVR diagnose and resolve problems with its main computers; (2) administer its systems and this Website; (3) report aggregated anonymous information to its business partners and providers; and (4) audit use of this Website. When users request pages from this Website, WVR's servers log their IP address. WVR does not normally link IP addresses to any Personal Information, so that a user's session will be logged, but they will remain anonymous to WVR. For example, WVR collects and/or tracks the home server domain name, the type of computer and browser used to access this Website. Such collection and tracking information is gathered by WVR as you navigate through this Website and the various pages in it.

WVR can and will use IP addresses to identify you when WVR feels it is necessary to enforce compliance with its Website Terms and/or this Privacy Statement, or to protect its services, Website, systems, information, employees, business partners, providers, users, customers or others.

_Cookies_ :  WVR may place "cookies" on your browser. Cookies are small pieces of information or text files a website sends to your computer and stores in a file on your hard drive. Cookies make browsing easier by saving your preferences so that websites can use the cookie to facilitate your use of, and improve your experience with, the site when you navigate through it or return to it. Cookies, by themselves, do not provide WVR with your individual identity or Personal Information unless you have chosen separately to provide it to WVR. WVR never saves passwords or credit card information in its cookies. The use of cookies is industry-standard and, as such, you will find that most major websites use them.

By showing, tracking or recording how and when users use this Website, cookies help WVR see which areas are popular and which are not. Manyupdates to the Website and user experience enhancements are based on information from cookies in conjunction with user and page view totals. 

Most cookies expire after a defined period of time, or you can delete or disable your cookie file(s) at any time. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. Some parts or features of WVR's Website or services may not function properly, be accessible or may be considerably slower if you delete or refuse to accept cookies. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set certain personalized preferences, and/or may have difficulty completing marketing or other Website transactions.

WVR has two (2) primary uses for cookies. First, to identify and specify a user's preferences; and second,  to track Website usage trends and patterns. This helps WVR to better understand its users' needs and to improve this Website. While both these uses and related activities are dependent on using cookies, you have the option, as described above, of disabling, deleting or refusing the cookies via your browser preferences or similar features.

In addition, you may occasionally receive cookies from WVR's business partners or providers, or when you link to other third party sites. WVR does not control these cookies, and disclaims any responsibility relating to the use or receipt of such cookies. You should note that the use of advertising cookies sent by third party servers is a standard practice in the Internet industry.

**Pixels**

WVR and its third party ad servers may use invisible pixels or beacons on this Website to count how many users visit certain pages. This information is collected and reported in the aggregate without the use of Personal Information. WVR may use this information to improve marketing programs and content, and to target its advertisements at this Website and/or other sites.

**With Whom Does WVR Share Information?**

As a general rule, WVR will not share with or disclose to any third parties any Personal Information you may submit or provide to WVR via this Website, in a manner that connects you with it, except (a) as otherwise described in this Privacy Statement, (b) when WVR has your permission ora as needed to complete a transaction you requested, or (c) under special circumstances, such as when WVR believes in good faith that the law requires such disclosure or under the circumstances described below. The following describes some of the ways that your Personal Information may be disclosed:

_Affiliates_ : WVR may share any or all of your Personal Information with and among its affiliated or related entities or family of companies. This is typically done so as to allow such entities and companies to offer to you information about their respective businesses, products and services that they believe may be of interest to you.

_Business Partners & Sponsors_: WVR may disclose some or all of your Personal Information to third party business partners or sponsors, as described elsewhere in this Privacy Statement. In the event and to the extent that there are additional uses of your Personal Information by WVR's business partners or sponsors (which additional uses are not otherwise described in or contemplated by this Privacy Statement), any such additional uses will be specifically described to you prior to or at the time such Personal Information is collected or prior to any transfer of such Personal Information to the business partners or sponsors. Many promotions offer opportunities for you to request additional information from such business partners and sponsors. By requesting additional information, you signify your consent to WVR's transfer of your Personal Information to the applicable business partners or sponsors so that they can respond to or fulfill your request. Although in many instances only your email address will be shared with these business sponsors and partners, WVR is not limited to the type of Personal Information that it may disclose, provided that you requested the additional information and WVR otherwise complied with this Privacy Statement.

_Third Party & Aggregate Data_: From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from third parties. If you opt to receive from these third parties information related to such materials or offers, WVR will (with your permission) share your name and email address with such third parties. Under confidentiality agreements, WVR may match Personal Information with data provided by these third parties. Also, as described above, WVR may keep track of which portions of the Website users are visiting and other user statistics, and aggregate this information to help WVR create a better Website user experience. This is all done without knowing your Personal Information, and allows WVR (in addition to other lawful purposes) to describe its users' preferences, and the types of services in which they may be interested, to its business partners, advertisers, sponsors and other third parties.

_Other_ : WVR may also disclose account information in special cases when it has reason to believe such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating the Website Terms or this Privacy Statement, or may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with any of WVR's rights or property, other users, or anyone else. WVR may disclose or access account information when it believes in good faith that the law requires it (and/or if compelled to do so by law enforcement or government agencies, or by other legal action, including without limit a warrant, subpoena or court order), and for administrative and other purposes it deems necessary to maintain, service, and/or improve this Website or its products and services.  We may also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to prevent harm to WVR, the Website or our customers.  This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts, government entities or law enforcement.

_Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control_ :  If the ownership of all or substantially all of any WVR entities’ business changes or such entity otherwise transfers assets relating to its business or the Website to a third party, your personal information may be transferred to the new owner to be used consistent with this Privacy Statement.  In such case, your information would remain subject to terms consistent with this Privacy Statement. 

**_Children_ : This Website is not intended for use by children. WVR does not knowingly solicit or collect Personal Information from children under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, you must obtain the consent of your parent or guardian to use this Website.  If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has submitted Personal Information to us, please contact us at [privacy@wynvr.com](mailto:privacy@wynvr.com), so that we may delete it from our records.**

**Opting Out; How Can You Control the Use of Information?**

Should you decide you want to opt out from WVR's use of any Personal Information you previously provided to (and/or authorized for use by) WVR, or if any of your Personal Information (such as your zip code or email address) changes, you may follow the procedure below. WVR makes periodic efforts to verify the accuracy of your Personal Information and to correct and update its databases based on the information available to it. In the event you believe any Personal Information held by WVR is inaccurate or outdated, WVR, upon notification and sufficient time for verification, will take all reasonable steps to correct any inaccuracy or update outdated Personal Information of which it is made aware. WVR also gives you the opportunity to control or opt out from the communications WVR directs to you. You may not be able to opt out concerning retention of certain Personal Information you previously provided that WVR needs for business or legal purposes, including without limit Personal Information submitted in connection with a reservation, or that relates to your use of any products or services.

**What Happens When You Link to a Third Party Site?**

You should be aware that when you are on WVR's Website, you may be able to hyperlink, or may be directed to third party websites beyond WVR's control and/or outside of its services. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement or a WVR search result, the "click" may transfer you off this Website to another unaffiliated site. These other sites may include material of advertisers, sponsors, providers and/or partners that may use WVR's and/or WVR's affiliated or related entities' logos as part of a co-branding agreement. These other sites may send their own cookies to, or collect or solicit Information from, users. WVR does not control such third parties or their sites, and is not responsible for their content or the links or advertising placed on them. WVR's inclusion in this Website of links to third party sites does not imply any endorsement of the material on those sites or any association with the third party operators. This Privacy Statement does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet and/or that is beyond WVR's control.

Please keep in mind that whenever you give out information over the Internet or otherwise in online environments (for example, via message boards or forums), it can be collected and used by people you do not know. While WVR strives to protect users' information and privacy, it cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose in these environments, and you disclose such information at your own risk.

**Where is your information?**

All Personal Information will be processed and stored by WVR in the United States. United States laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your jurisdiction.

**Is Your Information Secure?**

The security of all Information associated with users of this Website is an important concern to WVR. WVR exercises reasonable care in providing secure transmission of your Information from your computer to WVR's servers and databases. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while WVR strives to protect your Information, WVR cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Information you transmit to WVR, and you do so at your own risk. Once you complete the transmission of, and WVR receives, your Information, WVR uses industry standard efforts and practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your Personal Information, and uses commercially reasonable efforts to collect and secure such Personal Information consistent with all applicable laws and regulations. WVR takes commercially reasonable efforts to use a variety of different security measures (such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers) designed to protect Personal Information from access by unauthorized users both inside and outside of WVR, and to protect against the unauthorized or improper alteration or destruction of such Personal Information. WVR's communication system, software and database practices have been designed to aid in supporting authenticity, integrity and confidentiality. However, as described above, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet and, despite these reasonable efforts by WVR to maintain data and Information security, WVR cannot guarantee the security of data or Information.

Effective date: This policy was last updated on October 8, 2013.
