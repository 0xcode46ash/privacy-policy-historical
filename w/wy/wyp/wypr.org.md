WYPR is committed to protecting your privacy. Below you will find information about our commitment to ensuring the privacy of your personally identifiable information. Please read it carefully. If you have any questions, please send us an email at [frontdesk@wypr.org](mailto:frontdesk@wypr.org) or call during business hours at 1-410-235-1660.

Respect for the use of this information is one of our primary responsibilities.

WYPR does not rent or sell its member list. By station policy and by federal law WYPR does not trade or rent its list with any partisan group, political party, or party committee even if it is non-profit. WYPR uses a third party for the housing and processing of the data it exchanges.

This information is not made available to any third party and is considered completely confidential.

From time to time WYPR may need to change this policy. Any changes will be posted to this page as soon as reasonable possible, so please check this page periodically. By using this site, you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of this WYPR Web Site Privacy Policy.
