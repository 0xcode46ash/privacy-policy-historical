  * If you make any postings to public areas, such as forums, Q&A, or by providing content, then this information will be stored on our databases for public viewing, and in such case any personally identifiable information you submit will be publicly available and can be read, collected and used by other users, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.
  * When you send email or other communication to us, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. We won't share any information you send to us in those communications with any third parties.
  * We may share with third parties certain pieces of non-personal information. That information will not identify you, the individual, in any way.
  * Please note that this privacy policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be small.



Log information.

When you use your wePapers account, we collect certain information, as described above (the same information that most web sites log when they are accessed). As a basic matter, we need this information to help us provide our services to you.   
In addition, we log this information for security, audit, quality improvement, and other internal business purposes.

How wePapers may contact you.

wePapers may send you information related to your wePapers account or wePapers services. We try to keep these to a minimum. Because we believe such information is important, you will not be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them at this time.

We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer of ownership of wePapers, such as acquisition by or merger with another company. In such an event, wePapers will notify you before information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Updating your information.

You can change your wePapers account settings at any time in the "Settings" section of your account.  
You can terminate your account at any time, by sending us an email to contact@wepapers.com. We typically deactivate accounts within eight business days of such requests.
