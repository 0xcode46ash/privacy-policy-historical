# Privacy policy - WePapers

Privacy Policy  
  
wePapers is a free document management and sharing service. This policy describes the types of personal information we may collect and how we use it to provide the wePapers service.  
We respect your privacy. We will not give, sell or rent your email address to any third party and at time, for any reason.  
When you register with wePapers, we ask your name, email address and your account password. From time to time, we use your email address to send you administrative email messages â€“ we try to keep these to a minimum.   
By using wePapers, you agree to the collection and use of your personal information as described further below. You should know:

  * **When you visit this website, we collect your browser information (which typically includes browser type, version, host operating system and browser language) and IP address. We also send you a cookie or more for this purpose.** This information is gathered from all of our visitors. To access some of the services we offer, you will, from time to time, be asked to submit personal information about yourself. We store this information on our secure servers. 
  * We will never rent, sell or share information that personally identifies you for marketing purposes without your explicit consent.


  * You can update your account information and preferences at any time.


  * We also may collect information about the use of your account, such as how much storage you are using, how often you log in and other information related to your registration and use of wePapers. Information displayed or clicked on in your wePapers account is also recorded. We use this information internally to deliver the best possible service to you, such as improving the wePapers website and UI.
  * To comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, at this time wePapers is only available to users who are at least 13 years old. If you are under 13, please do not use the wePapers service.
  * **Should you choose to include additional personal information (** such as your age, city, academic affiliation and country **) to be displayed on your user profile on our website we will necessarily process these details.**
  * If you make any postings to public areas, such as forums, Q&A, or by providing content, then this information will be stored on our databases for public viewing, and in such case any personally identifiable information you submit will be publicly available and can be read, collected and used by other users, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.
  * When you send email or other communication to us, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. We won't share any information you send to us in those communications with any third parties.
  * We may share with third parties certain pieces of non-personal information. That information will not identify you, the individual, in any way.
  * Please note that this privacy policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be small.



Log information.

When you use your wePapers account, we collect certain information, as described above (the same information that most web sites log when they are accessed). As a basic matter, we need this information to help us provide our services to you.   
In addition, we log this information for security, audit, quality improvement, and other internal business purposes.

How wePapers may contact you.

wePapers may send you information related to your wePapers account or wePapers services. We try to keep these to a minimum. Because we believe such information is important, you will not be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them at this time.

Transfer of information.

Personal information collected by wePapers may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which wePapers maintains facilities. By using wePapers, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.  
We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer of ownership of wePapers, such as acquisition by or merger with another company. In such an event, wePapers will notify you before information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Updating your information.

You can change your wePapers account settings at any time in the "Settings" section of your account.  
You can terminate your account at any time, by sending us an email to delete@wepapers.com. We typically deactivate accounts within eight business days of such requests. You should be aware, however, that residual copies of information may remain stored on our systems even after the deletion of information or the termination of your account.  
The services are offered by wePapers, located at wepapers.com, Metudela 3A Jerusalem, Israel. E-mail: support@wepapers.com. We hope you will enjoy using wePapers.
