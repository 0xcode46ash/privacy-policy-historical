# Privacy Policy - WePay

WePay may share User information with third-party service providers who help with certain parts of our business operations including settlement, security, validation of user credentials, secure data storage, marketing, customer service, and other services. WePay requires that these service providers use personally identifiable User information only in connection with the services they perform for WePay.

WePay also may share non-personally identifiable User information with third parties that help us better understand how Users use our Service or help us detect and prevent fraud and other unauthorized or suspicious activity. These third parties may use cookies and other technologies to collect non-personally identifiable information about Users and combine it with similar information collected from others. They may use this information to help WePay to better understand our Users, and to help their other customers better understand their users.

A WePay Risk Score is not personally identifiable information, and WePay may share it (and other similar information generated by WePay) with Platforms or other third parties. WePay claims ownership of Risk Scores and similar analytical results that we generate using User information, whether alone or in combination with other information. WePay may use, disclose, or sell Risk Scores in WePay's sole discretion.

WePay may share User information in the event of a merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of all or a portion of our assets, or similar transaction, or in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which User information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets. Should such an event occur, WePay will endeavor to assure that the acquirer, successor, or assignee (as the case may be) follows this Privacy Policy with respect to User information. If User information could be used contrary to this Privacy Policy, Users will receive prior notice as well as the opportunity to opt out.

WePay may share User information with law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties in the event of a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure, or when WePay believes in good faith that the disclosure of User information is necessary or advisable to report suspected illegal activity, or to protect WePay's property or legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of WePay's Terms of Service, Merchant Agreement, and other agreements) or the property or rights of others, or otherwise to help protect the safety or security of the Services.

Except as expressly disclosed in this Privacy Policy, WePay will not sell or disclose User information to third parties. WePay will not sell, rent, share, or trade personally identifiable information to third parties (other than the Platform through which WePay collected such information) for their promotional purposes. WePay may disclose aggregated or other types of non-personally identifiable information to third parties for various purposes.
