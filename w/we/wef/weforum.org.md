# World Economic Forum - Privacy Statement

  
Like most web servers on the Internet, our servers collect and store all of the information that your web browser sends when it requests a web page, including:  


  * the name, domain, and numerical internet address of the "host" computer (typically a computer belonging to your Internet Service Provider and not your personal computer) from which you access the Internet. For example, your host computer's name and its numerical address
  * the date and time you accessed our site
  * the Internet address of the web page that you came from
  * the page you requested from our site and the number of characters sent to your computer
  * the information your web browser software sends as its so-called "User Agent," which typically identifies the browser software and may also indicate the operating system and type of CPU used in your personal computer

The World Economic Forum periodically summarizes and analyzes these log files to learn how visitors use content on the site. This information is used to allocate resources effectively and to improve the content, organization and performance of our site.

 **Collection and Release of Gathered Information**

We want to make it clear that we will not obtain personal identifying information about you when you visit our website, unless you choose to provide such information to us. Except in the course of officially authorized law enforcement investigations, or in the event of a suspected attempt to deliberately circumvent our system's security with the intent to gain unauthorized access or to do physical damage (for example, an attack by hackers), we do not attempt to identify individual users or share any information we receive with any parties outside of the World Economic Forum.

**Electronic Mail**

When you send us personal identifying information via e-mail (that is, in a message containing a question or comment, or by filling out a form that e-mails us this information), we use it to respond to your requests. We may forward your e-mail to other employees of the World Economic Forum who are better able to answer your questions. We do not retain or distribute lists of e-mail addresses to any parties outside of the World Economic Forum. In no event, do we distribute lists of e-mail addresses to any outside parties. Information collected via e-mail will be retained at our discretion in a directly readable form as long as necessary to complete our response.

**Cookies**

A cookie is simply a small piece of information that a web server asks your browser to store on your local computer, and then later your browser presents this information to the web server. In its simplest form, a cookie is just an identifying number.

The World Economic Forum uses cookies for anonymous visitor tracking. The World Economic Forum web server assigns each visitor a unique numerical ID. All requests for pages are tagged with that ID, and by analyzing log files, we can determine how many unique visitors used the site.

We do not know the identity of a person based on the numerical ID. The cookies used on our website do not contain any personal information about visitors, nor are they used to look up personal information about visitors. Even if you have entered information about yourself in one of our registration forms, we do not relate that information to the cookie data.

By using this site, you signify your agreement with the World Economic Forum's privacy policy. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of this policy at any time. Your continued use of this website following changes to these terms means you accept those changes.
