_General._ WeddingChannel.com and its partners collect personal information necessary to provide you with customized products and services and to allow you to use the resources available on our, and our partner's websites, including the creation and maintenance of a Wedding Account, a Wedding Website, a "Shopper Account" and an online bridal registry. Personal information includes, but is not limited to, name, physical address, email address, phone number, age and any other information that itself identifies or, when tied to the above information, may identify you as a specific individual. WeddingChannel.com and its partners also collect information related to your wedding, including dates and places of the rehearsal, wedding and reception, name, e-mail address and phone number of wedding guests, co-registrants and family members, and information relating to your gift registry and honeymoon. WeddingChannel.com may also collect your contact information, financial information (including credit card numbers) and demographic information when you request certain information, products and services on our website.

Your participation in these contests is entirely optional. Information we collect for such contests can include contact information and demographic information. WeddingChannel.com also values the opinions and comments from all of our users, so we frequently conduct surveys online, via e-mail, or by telephone. Your participation in these surveys is entirely optional. Information we collect in online surveys will include general information on the use of our website and other demographic information, such as age and income bracket. Survey participants are anonymous unless otherwise stated in the survey.

_Cookies._ "Cookies" are small pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies in several ways (and thousands of other websites are currently using them too!). Cookie files are used to better understand how you go through our website so we may tailor your experience at our website. Cookies are also used to tell us whether you have visited our website previously, and to help us determine whether you came to our website from a particular Internet link or banner advertisement. Cookies can also be used to help you to save and retrieve passwords and other information and preferences you use on our website, saving you from having to re-enter this information upon every visit to our website. Cookies cannot and will not be used by us to retrieve any personal information about you from your computer that you have not previously and voluntarily provided to us. However, cookies may also be received when you link to our partners' websites or when you view or click on banner advertisements served by our outside advertising company and we do not have control over how they use this information. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. However, most of our features will not function if you do not accept cookies. For more information on cookies, including how to opt-out of ad-serving cookies, see Terms and Conditions of Use. Please note that our "Celebrity Blog" service is hosted by a third-party company, Six-Apart TypePad. When you make use of this service, you are leaving our Web site and will be deemed to have agreed to Six-Apart's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy in effect at the time of such use.

 _Analysis._ We have partnered with a third party, Coremetrics, to assist us in better understanding how people use our site. Coremetrics analyzes the information collected on our website through cookies and returns it to us through a secure web connection. We use the information to help us understand your interests in our website and how to better serve you. We not allow Coremetrics to collect credit card, username or password information.

Coremetrics may only use your personal information to perform services for us. It may not share your personal information with anyone else, or use it for any other purpose, except on an aggregate, non-personal basis (in other words, the information will not be identified with you). Coremetrics is required to maintain all of the information it collects and analyzes securely and in confidence. For more information on the Coremetrics privacy policy, [click here](http://www.coremetrics.com/company/privacy.php).

**Third-Party Web Beacons**   
We use third-party web beacons from Yahoo! to help analyze where visitors go and what they do while visiting our website.

If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by Yahoo!, [click here](https://ondemand.indextools.com/optout,OptOut.vm?domain=stats.indextools.com).

**With whom your information is shared and how it is used**   
When you provide information to WeddingChannel.com or its partners as described above, some of the information is stored in our and some of our partners' databases. Such information is used by WeddingChannel.com in accordance with this Privacy Policy and by our partners in accordance with their policies. Information we collect is used by us (and our magazine) (i) to tailor your experience at our website, (ii) to show you content we think you might be interested in, (iii) to display content according to your preferences, (iv) to notify you of important functionality changes, new WeddingChannel.com services and other noteworthy news items about us, our magazine, our partners, and our vendors, (v) to send you and other wedding participants (i.e., family, quests and wedding party members) information, special offers and other promotional materials about WeddingChannel.com, our magazine, our partners and our vendors, and/or (vi) if it becomes necessary to contact you.

In addition, to allow you to use some of our features and/or to fulfill your requests and/or orders (including online bridal registry, online shopping and travel planning), information we collect will also be shared with our partners and other third parties, such as product suppliers, airlines, car rental agencies, and travel agencies. For example, when you use a credit card to purchase goods and services through our website, your encrypted credit card information will be sent to our retail partners that provide registry and shopping services or to CyberSource (an online credit card payment processor used by many restaurants and stores) to authorize your payment. Finally, we may also share your personal information with other providers of products and services we think may be of interest to you. You may choose at any time to remove your name and contact information from these lists as provided below.

Any information we collect may be shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. In addition, we may from time to time hire a third party to act on our behalf for projects such as market research surveys, contest entry processing, and other distribution, and we will provide information to these third parties specifically for use in connection with these projects. The information we provide to such third parties will be protected by a confidentiality agreement that will obligate the third party to use such information solely to complete the specific project.

In addition to the circumstances described above, we may disclose your information if required to do so by law, court order, as requested by other government or law enforcement authorities, or in the good faith belief disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable, including (without limitation) when we have reason to believe disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities. Information stored on our servers may also be transferred to a third party acquiring or merging with the company. However, any such third party shall be required to use such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**The choices you have about the collection and use of your information**   
WeddingChannel.com gives you a choice about how we use your personal information. Our website provides you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us at the point where we request information from you. In other words, if you don't want to receive such communications, just let us know at the time you provide such information. In addition, we will also provide you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving future marketing communications from us by clicking on the opt-out link at the bottom of e-mail communications. You may also contact our customer service department by phone at (888) 267-3187 or email our customer service department at [customerservice@weddingchannel.com ](mailto:customerservice@weddingchannel.com).

WeddingChannel.com also provides you with the ability to receive e-mail subscriptions to various services we provide. If you elect to receive such e-mail subscriptions, you can always opt-out of receiving future e-mail subscriptions by logging in to your account and following the appropriate links. If you have provided the name and e-mail address of another wedding participant, WeddingChannel.com will send such participant an e-mail inviting him or her to visit our website and giving such participant the opportunity to opt-out of receiving future information regarding WeddingChannel.com and its partners.

Your choices with respect to personal information provided by you or us to partners, vendors, and other third parties is governed by the privacy policies of such partners, vendors, and other third parties. We encourage you to read their privacy policies and follow their instructions with respect to the use of your information. WeddingChannel.com reserves the right to limit registration to those who will accept emails and to those who will provide the requested information.

**Your ability to access, update or correct your information**   
At any time, you can view, update, or delete all of the information contained in your Wedding Account, Guest Account or Wedding Website by logging in to your account and following the appropriate links. Your account log-in can be easily accessed by visiting our website at [www.weddingchannel.com ](http://www.weddingchannel.com/). In addition, you can update or delete such information by contacting our customer service department by phone at (888) 267-3187 or email our customer service department at [customerservice@weddingchannel.com](mailto:customerservice@weddingchannel.com). However, even if you delete or change some personal information in our registration database, it may still be stored on our, or other third party, databases (including those kept for archival purposes).

**The security measures we take to protect your personal information  
** All order information you provide to us and all information contained in your "Shopper Account" is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a widely used coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt or scramble data before you send it to us. Transactions will not be permitted if your browser does not accept SSL encryption. Only authorized personnel from WeddingChannel.com or its partners can decode this information and such personnel will only do so in accordance with our or their Privacy Policy. In addition, to attempt to deter the theft of credit card numbers and other personal information residing in our system, we and our retail partners have installed secure "firewalls" and/or have implemented other security measures to help protect our systems against "hacker" break-ins. Additionally, all credit card numbers are encrypted in our system until either the customer or WeddingChannel.com requires the information.

In addition, when you register for certain online bridal registries or other Wedding Website features, you will have the opportunity (depending on which partner you are registering with) to select whether you wish to make your online registry available to your guests via a password. If you do not elect to make your bridal registry or other Wedding Website features available only via password (or if you create a registry with a partner that does not provide this option), anyone visiting our website will be able to search for your registry or other Wedding Website features by using first and/or last names and wedding dates (and on some pages, city or state).

**Additional information about online privacy and changes to our policy**   
Please be aware our website has advertisements and links to other websites that may collect personal information about you. This Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices or policies of such websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of all such websites, as their policies may be materially different from our Privacy Policy.
