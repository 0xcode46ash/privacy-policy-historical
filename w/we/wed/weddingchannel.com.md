** WeddingChannel.com Privacy Policy  
**

WeddingChannel.com is strongly committed to your right to privacy and to taking steps designed to secure your personal and financial information. To earn your trust and confidence in our commitment, the intent of this policy is to fully disclose our privacy practices to you. We will only use your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

The WeddingChannel.com website is owned and operated by WeddingChannel.com, Inc., which is located at 700 South Flower St., Suite 600, Los Angeles, CA 90017. WeddingChannel.com makes the registries of various retailers available through this website and also offers wedding related products and services provided by other companies.

In many instances, when you provide personal information to this website, you are providing it to both WeddingChannel.com and to one of the retailers featured on the website. For example, if you create an account with WeddingChannel.com and then create a registry with a retailer (such as Macy's), your information will be provided to both WeddingChannel.com and Macy's. Likewise, if you purchase an item from a retailer on this website (for example, you buy an item from Bloomingdale's), your information will go to both WeddingChannel.com and Bloomingdale's.

So, to understand how any information collected may be used, you should review both WeddingChannel.com's privacy policy and the privacy policy of the retailer you intend to register with or purchase from.

The following are links to the privacy policies of some of the retailers and companies featured on this website that may receive your personal information:

 _Cookies._ "Cookies" are small pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies in several ways (and thousands of other websites are currently using them too!). Cookie files are used to better understand how you go through our website so we may tailor your experience at our website. Cookies are also used to tell us whether you have visited our website previously, and to help us determine whether you came to our website from a particular Internet link or banner advertisement. Cookies can also be used to help you to save and retrieve passwords and other information and preferences you use on our website, saving you from having to re-enter this information upon every visit to our website. Cookies cannot and will not be used by us to retrieve any personal information about you from your computer that you have not previously and voluntarily provided to us. However, cookies may also be received when you link to our partners' websites or when you view or click on banner advertisements served by our outside advertising company and we do not have control over how they use this information. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. However, most of our features will not function if you do not accept cookies. For more information on cookies, including how to opt-out of ad-serving cookies, see [Cookies](http://www.weddingchannel.com/ui/buildArticle.action?assetUID=42625&t=12&p=42591&l=30110).

 _Web Beacons._ Web beacons are small strings of code that are placed in a Web page. They are sometimes called “clear GIFs” (Graphics Interchange Format) or “pixel tags.” To target our Internet ads on other websites, we may use Web beacons provided by our outside advertising company on pages of this site in conjunction with ad-serving cookies. The information used in targeting our ads is not personally identifiable. We may also use Web beacons on our website for other purposes, for example, to learn how visitors use our site.

 _IP Addresses._ When you connect to our website, we record your IP addresses and information on the type of operating system (e.g. Windows98) and browser software(e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer) you are using. This helps us to diagnose problems with our servers and for system administration. Your IP address is also used to help gather aggregated demographic information.

 _Chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups._ We make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to you. Please remember any information disclosed in these areas becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. Please see  [](http://scmedia.theknot.com/Common/Articles/WeddingChannel/advertising-promotion-partnership-opportunities/privacy-policy/articles/Terms-and-Conditions-Content.aspx)[Terms and Conditions of Use](http://wedding.weddingchannel.com/help/termsAndConditionsOfUse.asp).

 **Third-Party Web Beacons**  
We use third-party web beacons from Yahoo! to help analyze where visitors go and what they do while visiting our website.

 **With whom your information is shared and how it is used**  
When you provide information to WeddingChannel.com or its partners as described above, some of the information is stored in our and some of our partners' databases. Such information is used by WeddingChannel.com in accordance with this Privacy Policy and by our partners in accordance with their policies. Information we collect is used by us (and our magazine) (i) to tailor your experience at our website, (ii) to show you content we think you might be interested in, (iii) to display content according to your preferences, (iv) to notify you of important functionality changes, new WeddingChannel.com services and other noteworthy news items about us, our magazine, our partners, and our vendors, (v) to send you and other wedding participants (i.e., family, quests and wedding party members) information, special offers and other promotional materials about WeddingChannel.com, our magazine, our partners and our vendors, and/or (vi) if it becomes necessary to contact you.

In addition, to allow you to use some of our features and/or to fulfill your requests and/or orders (including online bridal registry, online shopping and travel planning), information we collect will also be shared with our partners and other third parties, such as product suppliers, airlines, car rental agencies, and travel agencies. For example, when you use a credit card to purchase goods and services through our website, your encrypted credit card information will be sent to our retail partners that provide registry and shopping services or to CyberSource (an online credit card payment processor used by many restaurants and stores) to authorize your payment. Finally, we may also share your personal information with other providers of products and services, including our magazine, we think may be of interest to you. Although this Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices or policies of any such partners, vendors or third parties, we generally require all of our partners agree not to use your personal information, except as fully disclosed to you or authorized by you.

Any information we collect may be shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. In addition, we may from time to time hire a third party to act on our behalf for projects such as market research surveys, contest entry processing, and other distribution, and we will provide information to these third parties specifically for use in connection with these projects. The information we provide to such third parties will be protected by a confidentiality agreement that will obligate the third party to use such information solely to complete the specific project.

In addition to the circumstances described above, we may disclose your information if required to do so by law, court order, as requested by other government or law enforcement authorities, or in the good faith belief disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable, including (without limitation) when we have reason to believe disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities. Information stored on our servers may also be transferred to a third party acquiring or merging with the company. However, any such third party shall be required to use such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

 **The security measures we take to protect your personal information  
** All order information you provide to us and all information contained in your "Shopper Account" is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a widely used coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt or scramble data before you send it to us. Transactions will not be permitted if your browser does not accept SSL encryption. Only authorized personnel from WeddingChannel.com or its partners can decode this information and such personnel will only do so in accordance with our or their Privacy Policy. In addition, to attempt to deter the theft of credit card numbers and other personal information residing in our system, we and our retail partners have installed secure "firewalls" and/or have implemented other security measures to help protect our systems against "hacker" break-ins. Additionally, all credit card numbers are encrypted in our system until either the customer or WeddingChannel.com requires the information.

In addition, when you register for certain online bridal registries or other Wedding Website features, you will have the opportunity (depending on which partner you are registering with) to select whether you wish to make your online registry available to your guests via a password. If you do not elect to make your bridal registry or other Wedding Website features available only via password (or if you create a registry with a partner that does not provide this option), anyone visiting our website will be able to search for your registry or other Wedding Website features by using first and/or last names and wedding dates (and on some pages, city or state).
