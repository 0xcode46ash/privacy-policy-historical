Under the following circumstances, we may still be required to share your personal information:

  * If we respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or to defend against legal claims;
  * If we believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the Wedding Paper Divas Terms of Use or as otherwise required by law. 
  * If we must transfer information about you if Wedding Paper Divas is acquired by, reorganized by or merged with another company. If such an event were to occur, you would have the opportunity to ask not to receive promotional information.
