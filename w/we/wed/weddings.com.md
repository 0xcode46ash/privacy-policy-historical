# Weddings - Privacy Pledge

eddings.com is brought to you by Della & James, Inc. ("Della.com") and we are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy while you enjoy the services offered on Weddings.com. We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. This privacy policy, which is part of our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20000611121010id_/http%3A//www.weddings.com/terms.asp), sets forth our practices regarding the collection and use of "personal information" as well as the choices we offer you regarding the use of this information. "Personal information" is information that personally identifies you, including, for example, your name and email address.

This policy only addresses the activities on Weddings.com. Other sites (including www.della.com, www.dellaweddings.com and any other sites to which Weddings.com links and third party sites or services which we cobrand) may have their own policies, which we do not control, and thus are not addressed by this policy. You provide certain personal information to us when you: (a) register for or use the Weddings.com services, (b) sign up for special offers from selected third parties, (c) enter sweepstakes and contests sponsored by us or one of our partners, or (d) send email messages, submit forms or send other information to us. We may collect personal information from you at other points on our site that state that personal information is being collected.

Our servers automatically collect information about which sites users visit and which pages are viewed within the Weddings.com site. We use a feature of your browser called a "cookie" to assign an anonymous User ID that automatically identifies your computer when you visit the site so that we can remember you when you visit. Our site uses cookies to maintain a user's identity between sessions so that the site can be personalized based on user preferences or a user's history.

**How we use collected information**  
We use aggregated information we collect about users to develop and market products and features that may be of interest to you, to continue to improve our service, and to investigate activity that may violate our terms and conditions. We may also share aggregate information about our users with our business partners and other third parties. This information shows user activity as a whole rather than on an individual basis and cannot be used to individually identify you, except and unless you indicate that you would like to receive information about products and services from third parties. In addition, in order to provide you with certain features of the Weddings.com service, such as chat or calendaring services, we may provide some of your personal information to our third party service providers. You should note that personal information that you voluntarily disclose on message boards, chat or email lists may be used by third parties.

**Electronic Newsletters, Updates & Reminders**  
Weddings.com offers free, electronic newsletters and service updates as a service to its members. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please [contact us](mailto:contactus@weddings.com) by sending a message via email with the word “unsubscribe” in the subject line. We do not share our mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers or partners.

**Contests and Sweepstakes**  
Weddings.com occasionally runs contests and sweepstakes in which we request certain personal information on a voluntary basis. These contests and sweepstakes are conducted in full accordance with United States federal and state laws. The full rules and all information about such contests are clearly posted during the event, including how the information gathered will be used.

**Opting out of Communications**  
Weddings.com provides users several opportunities to opt out of receiving communications from us. We may use the information we collect to notify you of Weddings.com updates - including new partners, new functionality, or other things of interest. In every email we send, we provide instructions regarding how to opt out of receiving future mailings. 

**Changes to Policy**  
You acknowledge that this privacy policy is part of the terms of service and you agree that by using this site, you signify your assent to the Weddings.com privacy policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use our site. Weddings.com reserves the right to change the terms of service, including this policy, at any time as provided in the [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20000611121010id_/http%3A//www.weddings.com/terms.asp). Weddings.com will notify you of any such changes by posting notice of the availability of the amended version of this policy on our homepage.
