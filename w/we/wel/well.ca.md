# Privacy Notice | Well.ca - Canada's online health, beauty, and skin care store Free Shipping

### Your Privacy Is Important to Us

As a registered pharmacy in the province of Ontario, we are legally bound by the privacy laws of the Pharmacy Association of Ontario.

Our principles of privacy are pretty simple:
    – **We secure all private information using strong encryption technology**. Your information is always transferred using secure lines.
    – **We will never give or sell your information to anybody else**. That includes your address, email, phone, etc. (Of course, when we ship packages, we give the reputable shipping company your address.)
    – **You can always contact us** if you have questions about privacy or security.
    – **We won't contact you unless you ask us to**. If you don't ask for emails from us (or other forms of communication), we won't send them to you.

A detailed outline of our privacy principles is below

#### Extended Privacy Information

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. 

#### The Information We Collect:

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Well.ca website. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are: 

Name  
Address  
Email address  
Phone number  
Credit Card Information  


#### The Way We Use Information:

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order **only to complete that order**. **We do not share this information with outside parties** (or as required by law) except to the extent necessary to complete that order. 

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. **We do not send unsolicited emails**. If you feel that you have received an unsolicited email from us, please contact us. 

You can sign up to receive exclusive offers and news from Well.ca via email [here](https://well.ca/index.php?main_page=subscribe). Information that you submit will not be used for any purpose but to send out communications. 

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website but we do not share that information with any outside company, advertiser, or party. 

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

#### Our Commitment to Data Security:

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

All orders and tranfers of personal information happen over a secure, encrypted communication line. We do not store credit card information in a repository. Our database of customer information is stored securely in an encrypted database that is only visible to the staff responsible for completing your order. This staff has signed an agreement of confidentiality to ensure your privacy. 

#### Our Commitment to Children's Privacy:

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. 

#### How to Access or Correct Your Information

You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by contacting us either by email or phone. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. 

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows the error. 

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
