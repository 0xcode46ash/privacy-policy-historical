#### **Privacy Statement**

Welcome to WellPoint's Web sites. We appreciate your interest in us and hope to make your on-line experience enjoyable and secure. Your privacy is very important to us and we will make every reasonable effort to safeguard any information we collect. We will not sell your personally identifiable information without your express written permission. 

#### **What information will WellPoint collect?**

Information may be collected in two ways on our Web site. You may elect to establish an account on our Web sites so that you can gain additional access to services and applications where it is important for us to know who you are in order to best meet your needs. Personal information will not be collected from you without your knowledge. Providing personal information is always voluntary. Second, we may use "cookies" to help us improve our Web site by tracking your navigation habits and to store some of your preferences. A cookie is a small file created by an Internet site to store information on your computer. Cookies do not allow Web sites to gain access to other information on your computer. Once a cookie is saved on your computer, only the Web site that created the cookie can read it.   


#### Linking to Other Sites

From time to time we will provide links to other Web sites, not owned or controlled by WellPoint. We do this because we think this information might be of interest or use to you or where, as a member, we can provide you with value added services. While we do our best to ensure your privacy, we cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. A link to a non-WellPoint Web site does not constitute or imply endorsement by WellPoint. Additionally, we cannot guarantee the quality or accuracy of information presented on non-WellPoint Web sites. We encourage you to review the privacy practices of any Web site you visit. 

#### **What if I don't want information about me to be collected?**

Providing personal information through WellPoint's Web site is an option. Additionally, personally identifiable information will not be collected from you without your knowledge and approval.  


#### How will information collected about me be used?

Information you share with us will be used in a variety of ways that let us serve you better. We may also use this information to perform administrative, technical, hosting or other functions that help us manage our site and deliver new functionality to you. 

#### **Use of electronic mail**

We may provide email links on our site to further facilitate communication between WellPoint and you. Information collected through electronic mail may be shared with our customer service department, employees or other third parties that perform services on our behalf. Unless otherwise noted, electronic mail on our site is not a completely secure and confidential means of communication. Non-encrypted electronic communications may be accessed and viewed by other Internet users without your knowledge and permission while in transit to us. 

#### **Changes to our Web Privacy Statement**

The foregoing Web Privacy Statement is effective as of July 1, 2004. WellPoint, Inc. may change this statement from time to time without notice. This statement is not intended to and does not create any contractual or other legal right in or on behalf of any party.
