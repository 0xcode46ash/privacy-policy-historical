**IP Addresses**  
An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. All computer identification on the Internet is conducted with IP addresses, which allow computers and servers to recognize and communicate with each other. wellness.com collects IP addresses in order to conduct system administration, report aggregate information to sponsors and advertisers, and to conduct site analysis. If a visitor requests pages from wellness.com, the wellness.com servers enter the visitor's IP address into a log. To maintain visitor anonymity, wellness.com does not associate IP addresses with records containing personal information. However, wellness.com will use IP addresses to identify any visitors who refuse to comply with wellness.com's in- house rules or terms of service, and to identify visitors who threaten our service, site, customers or others.
