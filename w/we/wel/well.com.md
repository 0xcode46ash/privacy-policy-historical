# The WELL - Privacy Policy

WELL Privacy Policy

The WELL respects your right to the privacy of the personal information you provide us. We are a non-anonymous community site. We ask members to make their real names known to each other when logged in to our system and communicating with one another. We seek to provide this non-anonymous social environment while treating your privacy with respect and care. 

To that end, unless you designate otherwise or we state otherwise in this policy or at the time information is collected, with the exception of using your real name as described, any personal information you provide to The WELL will be known only to two parties: you and the staffs of The WELL and our parent company, Salon.com. Your name will be available to other members for purposes of community participation. However, we will not disclose the fact of your membership by name to non-members without your permission, except in specific situations such as to law enforcement agencies as specified in this document. 

The following policy is intended to explain how your personal information will be treated as you make use of our sites and their features. Personal information includes your street and off-WELL e-mail addresses, billing information, click-through and usage activity and any other personal information you may provide at the behest of The WELL. This policy may change from time to time, with announcement and discussion in the WELL forum area known as the Policy Conference (go there by typing: **g policy** ). Please check there periodically. 

Announcements and spam

At the time of registering for their memberships, WELL subscribers receive a short series of orientation emails from The WELL. From time to time, members may receive notification of new services, changes to policies or price adjustments. We will not send you other email at the address you provide, except for infrequent communications to resolve issues that may arise with your own WELL account. More routine announcements are made in the WELL Newsletter Conference ( **g news** ) rather than via email. 

We will not sell, rent or give your email address to any third party. If you choose an account without a WELL email address, the email address you provide when you register with The WELL will be visible to other WELL members so that they may communicate privately with you. You are free at any time to substitute an alternate e-mail address if you wish to keep the one you initially registered private. We do not permit the use of WELL email accounts for sending unsolicited bulk commercial email. 

Traffic data

Each time a visitor comes to The WELL's servers, including the shell host, mail machines or our Web sites, our servers -- like most on the Web -- collect some basic technical information, including, for example, the visitor's domain name (e.g., whether the user is logged on from aol.com or whitehouse.gov), referral data (e.g., we may record the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to a WELL Web site) and Web browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform). 

We also count, track and aggregate each visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic differs within conferences, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information about membership levels and activity into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with investors or the public; but we will not disclose your individual identity as a WELL member nor discuss your personally identifiable data without your permission. When we do present any form of aggregated information to outside parties, no one will be able to identify you or contact you. We do not release aggregated data for individual WELL Private Conferences. 

Use of cookies at The WELL

A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored in your computer's memory or written on your computer's hard drive. We use session cookies, non-peristant files which vanish when you shut down your browser, to allow the system to know you have already entered a password each time you click for more data in a conference login session. Our cookies do not contain any of the personal information you have provided to us. We use cookies for our Web conferencing interface, not for telnet access to conferences. 

We do not use cookies to track usage on our site, but the conferencing software itself tracks what you have seen in order to show you new material when you return. This information about when you were last present is available to other members of the system in the forums to which you have mutual access so that it is easier to tell who is up to date in a group conversation. We never provide this information on your activity to non-participants. 

Other disclosure of personal information 

The WELL will not otherwise use or disclose your personal information without your consent except (i) as described in this privacy policy, or (ii) as required by law. Any subscriber whose information is sought in accordance with this policy will be advised of the inquiry as soon as practical. Notification of such inquiries will be emailed to members before disclosures are made, unless notification is prohibited by law. 

This privacy policy may not protect information you voluntarily disclose to others via a post to any online conference, email list, chat or send tool or any other communication environment within or from our service.
