**Wellmark's Mission**  
This is the Web site of Wellmark, Inc. We understand that our customers and Web site visitors are concerned about the privacy of information. We at Wellmark are committed to respecting your privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of personally identifiable information you share with us (any information by which you can be identified, such as name, address and telephone number). That is why Wellmark has established this privacy policy, so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your information. Because Wellmark wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices and want to assure you that we take reasonable steps to see that this policy is followed within our company.

**Personal Information**  
In general, you can visit wellmark.com without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We track the Internet address of the domains from which people visit us and analyze this data for trends and statistics, but the individual user remains anonymous. The information we collect and analyze is used to improve our service to you.

**Choice**  
There are times, however, when we may collect personal information from you. It is our intent to inform you before we do that and to tell you what we intend to do with the information. You will have the option not to provide the information, and in the future you will be able to "opt out" of certain uses of the information.

**Accuracy**  
We do our best to maintain the accuracy of personal information you supply to us; we are working on tools that will allow you to review and update your information in the future.

**Security**  
We intend to protect the quality and integrity of your personally identifiable information. We will take appropriate steps to protect the information you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure.

We only allow confidential information to be submitted for transmission if your browser is compatible with our security software. If your browser is not compatible, you will receive a message indicating your transaction cannot be completed because of the security risk.
