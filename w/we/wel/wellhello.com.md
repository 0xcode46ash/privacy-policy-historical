**WELLHELLO** **.COM PRIVACY POLICY**

 Rev. 10/01/13

 **Our Commitment to Privacy**

 WellHello .com takes your privacy seriously.  This Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our site.  Please read it carefully.

 **No Information From Persons Under 13**

No person under 13 is allowed to use this site or to disclose information on this site.  For more information about protecting children’s privacy online, visit www.ftc.gov/kidzprivacy. 

**The Information We Collect**

When you visit our site you may provide us with two types of information: personal information you choose to disclose (“User Information”) and session/site usage information collected, in a way generally not visible to you, on an aggregate basis as you and others access and browse our site (“Access Information”).  User Information is only collected from registered users of the site, whereas Access Information is collected from all users of the site, whether registered or unregistered.

 **User Information Collected**

Certain functionality of the site is available only to registered users of the site (“Users”).  In order to become a User, we require you to supply the following information:

    First and last name;  
    Email address;  
    Gender; and  
    Date of birth  
    Zip Code

We may ask you to provide other demographic information, such as sexual orientation, marital status and personal measurements.  You are not required to provide such information in order to become a User.  Such information is treated in the same manner as the User Information identified above.

We require you to select a unique user name. Please note that your user name is not “User Information” for the purpose of this privacy policy, and will be visible to other users of the site (for example, to identify you as the author of certain posts, or in a list of Users logged in at a given time). Accordingly, if you do not wish to disclose your identity to others on the site, you should select a user name that does not include any personally identifiable information. 

Users may upload content. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information contained in, or ascertainable from, the content you upload to the site. By uploading content to the site, you waive any claim to privacy rights in connection with information contained in, or ascertainable from, such content.  

 **Access Information Collected**

 **Cookies**

Like most Web sites, WellHello.com uses cookies.  A "cookie" is a small piece of data that a Web site stores in a designated file on your computer. Cookies are commonly used to store user names and/or passwords to facilitate access to the site.  Cookies can also be used to store, among other things, user preferences, login dates and times, and content viewing history. When you visit a Web site, that site can access only that information which it stored in a cookie -- not information put in a cookie by other Web sites. Cookies make your online experience easier and more personalized.

 WellHello.com uses cookies and other technologies to recognize you and to provide  personalization, as well as to help us understand how our site is used.  Users must have cookies enabled in order for the site to function properly. We do NOT currently honour Do Not track (DNT) browser settings in any browser.

WellHello.com lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to WellHello.com’s cookies. 

**Server Log and Clickstream Data**  
 **     **  
Our site’s servers also automatically identify your computer by its Internet Protocol address (a unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider) each time you access the site, and maintain logs of the specific content on the site that you access.  Our servers also record various information pertaining to your computer configuration, including but not limited to the Web browser software you use, the resolution settings of your monitor, and the Web site from which you were referred to the site, if any.  

  **How We Use the Information Collected**  
 ** **  
 **Providing Information and Services**

We use the User Information to contact you about changes to our site, new services, features or products we offer, or other information we think you will find of interest, as well as to customize your user experience.  We will not rent, sell, or share your personally identifiable information (i.e., your name or email address) with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: 

    \- We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

    \- We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of WellHello.com’s terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

    \- We transfer information about you if WellHello.com is acquired by or merged with another company, or in connection with a potential acquisition or merger.

**Serving Advertising**

We may disclose non-personally identifiable information about user habits, characteristics and user patterns, based on aggregate user statistics, to others in connection with the advertising, marketing, or operation of our site.  In addition, we may display targeted advertisements based on your User Information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria—for example, men ages 35-40. 

WellHello.com does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. 

**Web site Administration / R &D**

We use non-personally identifiable information to gather data about our users and to enhance and design our site to make it easier, faster and friendlier to use.  Additionally, Access Information helps us know how many people visit our site, when they visit and how they use our service.  We may disclose this data to others in the aggregate in connection with sales, marketing, development, or other activities.  

**Your Ability to Edit Your Account Information and Preferences**

If you wish to remove yourself from our email lists then you can simply click the unsubscribe link from one of our emails, edit the settings in your profile under ‘My Account>Edit Profile’ or send an email (from the address you have registered with us) to admin@wellhello.com; or writing to us at SMOOCHY BRANDS LLC, 274 N GOODMAN STREET, SUITE B275, ROCHESTER, NY 14607, USA; or calling us at +44 121 288 7427.

We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the site, such as service announcements, administrative messages and newsletters, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. 

**Confidentiality and Security**

We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
