# Privacy statement

The Wellcome Trust regards the lawful and correct treatment of personal information as very important and to this end is fully committed to the principles of data protection, as set out in the Data Protection Act.

  * How we use this information

###  **What information we collect about you**

We process personal data in connection with our charitable mission to foster and promote research with the aim of improving human and animal health. We do this through a range of activities including grant funding, capacity building in history of medicine and biomedical ethics, and by measuring the societal and historical impacts of biomedical research. 

###  **How we use this information**

Information that you supply in connection with a grant application and any funding arising from it will be treated in confidence and in accordance with the principles of the Data Protection Act. Full details are provided on the grant application forms. 

You may be asked for personal information if you want to take advantage of specific services we offer such as the online project grant application form, publication subscription forms or library enquiry forms. In each case we will only use the personal information you provide to deliver the services you have told us you wish to take part in. 

###  **Surveys**

From time to time we conduct web surveys among current and previous grantholders to evaluate the impact of our policies and funding. At any stage of the survey or subsequently, you can ask that part or all of the record of the survey is destroyed or deleted. The method for doing this is explained on the survey form. 

The survey results will be used solely to evaluate Trust policy and research activities; no information contained in the results will be attributed to the person who submitted it without their explicit consent being obtained in advance. The survey results may be anonymised and, for information/research purposes, may also be made available to other organisations, some of which are our funding partners. We will tell you who these organisations are as part of the survey process. 

All data collected by the Trust for the purpose of surveys will be held and processed by the Trust in a secure environment. All data will be anonymised and stored for a maximum of two years and then destroyed, unless the data is required for career-tracking purposes in which case it will not be anonymised and will be held for a longer period of time. 

###  **Do we use 'cookies'?**

When you log into this site your computer will automatically be issued with a cookie. Cookies are text files that identify your computer to our server. Cookies in themselves do not identify the individual user, just the computer used. Cookies allow our server to remember you are the same person as you move through a survey. 

The Trust also uses cookies to gather non-personal statistical information about visitors to our sites, such as the number of visits to pages, the amount of time spent viewing a page, the path taken by visitors to a particular page and other general information. The Trust uses this information to improve our websites. 

You have the opportunity to set your computer to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or choose not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these options may prevent you from accessing all functions of this site.  [Find out more about cookies](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). 

###  **How do we protect personal information?**

We use appropriate organisational and technical measures to ensure that your data is secure and protected from loss, misuse and unauthorised access or alteration. From time to time we introduce changes or improvements to our systems. Any test data that may have been used in this connection is managed in a secure and confidential manner. 

###  **Do we share your information with anyone else?**

The Trust does not pass on information including email addresses to others unless we have stated that we will do so as part of our terms and conditions. 

###  **Your rights**

You have the right to ask for a copy of the information we hold about you (for which we may charge a small fee) and to have any inaccuracies in your information corrected. 

###  **How to tell us about changes**

If your details have changed, or if you have any questions about data protection or require further information, please email  [dataprotection@wellcome.ac.uk](mailto:dataprotection@wellcome.ac.uk).
