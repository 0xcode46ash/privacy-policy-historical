# Privacy Policy | Weatherford International

Weatherford International plc (“ **Weatherford** ” or “ **We** ”) is committed to protecting the privacy of your information and personal data collected during your visit to this website.  In this Website Privacy Policy (“ **Policy** ”), Weatherford provides information about how we collect, use and transfer personally identifiable data from you, a website visitor, through www.weatherford.com and other websites that we operate and on which we post a direct link to this Policy (collectively the “ **Website** ”).

**Scope**

This Policy covers only data collected through the Website and not any other data collection or processing, including, without limitation, data collection practices of other web pages to which we link or data that we or our affiliates collect offline or through websites that do not display a direct link to this Policy. Occasionally, we may refer to this Policy in notices and consent requests related to surveys and special-purpose web pages; under such circumstances, this Policy applies as modified in the particular notice or consent request (e.g., with respect to types of data collected or purposes of collection). Some of our business units and web pages apply this Policy subject to specifically disclosed modifications, supplements or exceptions.

**Acceptance and Consent**

PLEASE READ THIS POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND OUR POLICIES AND PRACTICES REGARDING YOUR INFORMATION AND HOW WE WILL TREAT IT.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH OUR POLICIES AND PRACTICES, YOUR CHOICE IS NOT TO USE OUR WEBSITE. BY ACCESSING OR USING THIS WEBSITE, YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. THIS POLICY MAY CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME. YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THIS WEBSITE AFTER WE MAKE CHANGES IS DEEMED TO BE ACCEPTANCE OF THOSE CHANGES, SO PLEASE CHECK THIS PRIVACY POLICY PERIODICALLY FOR UPDATES. 

**TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY CONSENT TO ANY AND ALL DATA COLLECTION BY THIS WEBSITE AS EXPRESSLY DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY OR AS OTHERWISE CONTEMPLATED HEREIN.  FURTHERMORE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU ALSO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY CONSENT THAT SUCH DATA COLLECTION MAY RESULT IN PROCESSING AND/OR TRANSFERRING YOUR DATA TO WEATHERFORD’S SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES OR THIRD PARTIES.  **

**Types of Data and Collection Methods**

Through the Website, we receive data that you actively submit as well as data that we track:

Actively Submitted Data: When you request information, respond to an online survey or otherwise actively send us data, we usually collect data such as your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number(s), and certain information related to the business you represent. In each such instance, you will know what data we collect through the Website, because you actively submit it.

Passively Tracked Data: When you visit the Website, we also passively track information on your computer and Internet connection, such as the IP address of your computer and/or Internet service provider, the date and time you access our websites, the Internet address of websites from which you link to our Website, the computer technology you are using and your movements and preferences on our Website. We use technology that many other websites employ, including, without limitation, web beacons, “cookies” (flash or browser based) or small data files stored on your computer’s hard drive, to collect information such as the aforementioned. In some instances, we also use cookies to collect information in connection with future visits from that Website, to recognize you as a previous visitor and to track your activity on the Website. You can refuse cookies by turning them off on your browser. Weatherford currently does not respond to Do Not Track signals. 

Combinations:  Unless you also actively submit personal information such as your name or address, passively tracked data does not typically allow us to identify you personally (even though it can theoretically be done, we do not have the means or an interest to find out who you are, unless you identify yourself voluntarily through an active submission of data). To the extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to combine passively tracked data with personal data that you actively submit.

**Collection Purposes, Use of Data**

We collect passively tracked data primarily for purposes of administering, protecting and improving our Website and our systems, to better understand the preferences of our Website visitors, to identify server problems, to compile aggregated statistics about Website usage, and to help personalize your experience of our Website.

We collect actively submitted data primarily for two purposes: Firstly, for the purpose for which you originally sent us the data (e.g., to mail information to you). Two, for purposes of informing you about products and services; you can opt out of receiving marketing emails as explained below.

**Disclosures of Personal Information**

We do not sell or rent your information to telemarketers and do not share your personally identifiable information with others, except as follows: We freely share your information with our affiliates. We also share your information with agents and service providers who use the data only on our behalf and for our purposes under confidentiality agreements. We may share your information as required by law or in the interest of protecting or exercising our or others’ legal rights, e.g., without limitation, in connection with requests from law enforcement officials and in connection with court proceedings. We may share or transfer your information in connection with a prospective or actual sale, merger, transfer or other reorganization of all or parts of our business. Also, we reserve the right to fully use and disclose any information collected via the Website that is not in personally identifiable form.

**Opt-Out**

In connection with promotions or other projects, we may ask you specifically whether you have objections against a certain kind of data use or sharing. If you opt-out under such circumstances, we will respect your decision. To opt-out of receiving further commercial emails or to unsubscribe from services, please click the unsubscribe link contained in the commercial email or contact us. Please note that other data recipients have their own data privacy policies, which may differ from ours and you would have to contact them separately with respect to opt-out requests.

**Access**

If personal information you have submitted through the Website is no longer accurate, current, or complete, and you wish to update it, please contact us. Upon appropriate request we will usually be glad to update or amend your information, but we reserve the right to use information obtained previously to verify your identity or take other actions that we believe are appropriate.

**Security**

Transmissions over the Internet are never 100% secure or error-free. However, we take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. It is your responsibility to safeguard any information you use to access the Website and to notify us if you ever suspect that such information has been compromised. You are solely responsible for any unauthorized use of the Website.

**SPECIAL NOTICE - Children´s Privacy**

We do not intentionally or knowingly collect personally-identifiable information from children under the age of 13 and we request that individuals under the age of 13 not submit any personal information on the Website.

**Amendments**

We reserve the right to change this Policy from time to time and in our sole discretion. We reserve the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of this Policy at any time, but will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the Policy the date it was last updated. When you visit the Website, you are accepting the current version of this Policy as posted on the Website at that time. We recommend that users revisit this Policy on occasion to learn of any changes.
