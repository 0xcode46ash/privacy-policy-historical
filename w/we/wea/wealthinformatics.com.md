As an individual who is a user of our websites (including, but not limited to, JustThrive.com), or otherwise as a user of the services provided by **Thrive** or its divisions and subsidiaries (collectively “ **Thrive** ”), which are all a subsidiary of LendingTree, LLC (“LendingTree”), this Privacy Policy is intended to describe for you: 

  * the information we collect about you; 
  * how that information may be used; 
  * with whom it may be shared; 
  * how you may access the information you provide us; and 
  * your choices about such uses and disclosures. 



_In other words: because you use **Thrive** , you may have given us some of your personal information and we want you to know what we do with it.  So we're telling you! _

**Thrive** understands that your privacy is important. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using our websites or services. By using our websites, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. The “ **Thrive** Service” refers to the applications, platform, web site (http://www.justthrive.com) and services controlled, operated or produced by **Thrive**. If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to the end of this Privacy Policy for information on how to contact us. 

_In other words: reading the Privacy Policy of any website that you choose to give your personal information is important.   If you have questions or something seems unclear, let us know at [support@justthrive.com](mailto:support@justthrive.com). _

**Thrive** 's parent company, LendingTree (and its parent, "Tree.com"), also engages in real estate and real estate brokerage activities through several other divisions or subsidiaries (including RealEstate.com and iNest Realty Inc.), and maintains several real estate-related websites (including RealEstate.com, iNest.com, and Domania.com).

_In other words: **Thrive** is ultimately owned by Tree.com, which also owns other companies that we think you might want to read about, so we link to them here. _

**Thrive** is a licensee of the TRUSTe Web Privacy Seal Program. TRUSTe is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to ensuring consumer privacy on the web by identifying businesses with trustworthy online privacy policies.

Because we want to show our commitment to your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices and have them reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. 

_In other words: TRUSTe is a watchdog organization that makes sure companies protect your information.   Participation in their program is voluntary, but we think protecting your information is so important that we want to make sure we're doing the best job we can, so we have our privacy policies reviewed by TRUSTe to make sure we're doing the best we can for you. _

### information we collect about you

**In General.**  We may collect personal information that can identify you such as your name and e-mail address, as well as other information that does not identify you. When you provide personal information through our websites, the information may be sent to **Thrive** servers located in the United States and other countries around the world. 

**Information You Provide.**  We may collect and store any personal information you enter on our websites or provide to us in some other manner. This includes identifying information (such as your name, home or mailing address, e-mail address, and telephone number), information about your home or prospective home, your education or potential education, your financial information (such as your income, assets, or debts), and other personal information (such as your gender and age) 

**Information from Other Sources.**  We may also periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from business partners, contractors and other third parties. Examples of information we may receive include information about your home and additional demographic information. When you access **Thrive** (including through your computer or your mobile device) or open one of our emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology. This "automatically collected" information may include Internet Protocol address ("IP Address"), a unique user ID, versions of software installed, system type, the content and pages that you access on **Thrive** , and the dates and times that you visit the **Thrive**. 

**Use of Cookies and Other Technologies to Automatically Collect Information.**  We and our authorized service providers use various technologies to collect information from your computer and about your activities on our websites (see "Information Collected by Third Parties" below). We and these companies automatically collect information from your browser when you visit our websites. This information includes your IP address, your browser type and language, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us or them (see "Cookies" below) and the referring website address. 

**Cookies.**  When you visit our websites, we and our authorized service providers may assign your computer one or more [cookies](http://www.lendingtree.com/stmrc/pp_definitions.asp) to facilitate access to our websites, to personalize your online experience, and to record information about your visit to websites. Through the use of a cookie, we and our authorized service providers may automatically collect information about your online activity on websites, such as the web pages you visit, the links or advertisements you click, or the other actions you conduct while on websites. The cookies do not store any personally identifiable information about you. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to use some of the interactive features offered on our website. 

**Other Technologies.**  We may use standard Internet technology, such as  [web beacons](http://www.lendingtree.com/stmrc/pp_definitions.asp) and other similar technologies, to track your use on our websites. We also may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer our users and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, programming, or other activities. 

**Information Collected by Third Parties.**  We may allow third-parties, including our authorized service to display other materials on our websites, and to deploy technology for your benefit, for example, to load web pages quicker. We and these companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with our website. Our website does not provide any personal information to these third parties. 

_In other words: we collection information from you both automatically and through **Thrive**.  This section tells you about the kind of information we collect.  Some of it is info you enter into the site, like your name, your financial information, and your e-mail address.  Other info is collected automatically, like how often you log into **Thrive** and how long it takes for the site to load.  The section below will tell you all about why we collection this information. _

### how we use the information we collect

**In General.** We may use information that we collect about you to:   
Deliver the products and services that you have requested;   
Manage your customer relationship and provide you with customer support;   
Perform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in, our products, services, or content, or products, services or content offered by others;   
Communicate with you by e-mail, postal mail, telephone and/or mobile devices about our products or services that may be of interest to you either from us or other Lending Tree and/or Tree.com, Inc. companies;   
Verify your eligibility and deliver prizes in connection with promotions, contests and sweepstakes;   
Enforce our terms and conditions;   
Manage our business and Perform functions as otherwise described to you at the time of collection. 

**Financial Information.** We may use financial information to verify your identity, to protect against or identify possible fraudulent transactions, or otherwise as needed to provide services to you. Please review "Your choices about collection and use of your information" below. 

_In other words: sometimes, it is immediately clear why we collect information.   We need your e-mail, for example, so we can send you alerts and so that you can log in to the site.  For other information, however, it may not be so clear, so this section tells you about the other things we do.  For example, we collect how often you log into **Thrive** so that we know how to improve our service: knowing, for example, that logging in more often means that people reduce their spending, means we can send e-mails to you to remind you to log in if it seems like you're going on a spending spree.  We want to help people spend less and save more, and so we try to collect the information that helps us do that. _

### with whom we share your information

We want you to understand when and with whom we may share personal or other information we have collected about you or your activities on our websites or while using our services. 

**Personal Information.**   We do not share your personal information with other organizations for their  _marketing_  or  _promotional_  uses without your prior express consent. We may, however, share personal information with: 

**Authorized Service Providers.**   We may disclose some limited user information to affiliated companies, contractors or other businesses or persons to: provide web site hosting, maintenance, and security services; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; and assist **Thrive** in improving our service and creating new services features. We generally contractually require that these parties process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy, we authorize only a limited use of such information, and we require these parties to use reasonable confidentiality measures. These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purpose.  These third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies that describe how they use and disclose personal information. Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the websites of those third parties. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States 

**Other Situations.**  We also may disclose your information: If required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. copyright or trademark law). In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us. When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our websites' terms and conditions or other agreements or policies. In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, asset sale or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. 

**Aggregated and Non-Personal Information.**  We may share aggregated information (i.e., information about you and other customers collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you) and other non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties and LendingTree and Tree.com, Inc. companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on websites of third parties. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our websites and the most popular features or services accessed. This information does not contain any personal information and may be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising. 

**Third Party Websites.**  There are a number of places on our websites where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on a recommendation or a search result on our websites, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting. 

_In other words: sometimes, we share your information with others, but don't panic- we do it for a good reason.   Sometimes, we need help creating **Thrive** features and in order to do so, we have to provide some of your information to them.  For example, in order to provide you with our credit score estimate, we need to send a few things about your finances to Credit.com so that they can estimate the score for you.  We might also share information about you to help people better understand personal finance in general.  For example, we might anonymize your data by mixing it up with everyone else in **Thrive** and then removing the personal stuff, like your name, and then use this aggregate data to power a feature.  For example, we could show a map of which state has the highest savings rate or what age group has the biggest rainy day fund, or even tell you what other people your age are doing.  We always do this with your best interests in mind, and if you have questions about why we're using your data a particular way, shoot us an e-mail [support@justthrive.com](mailto:support@justthrive.com) and we'll explain what we're trying to do. We want to hear your feedback and always consider changing the way we use data based on how our users are feeling. _

### how you can access your information

You can update your personal information through **Thrive** itself, in the Profile section.  For assistance, contact [support@justthrive.com](mailto:support@justthrive.com) and we can help you to manage your personal information. 

### your choices about collection and use of your information

You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our website because such information may be required in order for you to obtain products or services from us.   
When you initially use our websites, you will be given a choice as to whether you want to receive e-mail messages or newsletters from us. You may modify your choice at any time in the Profile section of our website. You also will be given the opportunity, in any commercial e-mail that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications such as administrative communication including requests for additional information, service updates or announcements, notices and surveys without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that opting out of receipt of promotional e-mail communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change your preferences directly with that third party.   
_In other words: you can change your information at any time using **Thrive** , and you can choose what e-mails to receive.  But we won't let you choose not to receive some e-mails, like security alerts and communications that we think are truly critical.  Don't worry, we won't abuse the privilege. _

### how we protect your personal information

We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees and authorized third-party service providers are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. We use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information. 

We want you to feel confident using our website. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information. Please refer to the  [Federal Trade Commission's website](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm) for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft. 

_In other words: we work hard on making sure your data is secure.   We work with outside security agencies to check that we are protected, we use the latest in security technology, and we carefully limit how much information we store on our systems.  We are confident in our security, so much so that the data of our team and people we care about is in our system right alongside yours.  Protecting personally identifiable information is always a priority for us. _

### other information about or privacy practices

If you are visiting our websites from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Please be assured that we seek to take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected.
