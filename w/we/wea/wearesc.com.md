Rivals.com, Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for all Rivals.com-affiliated Web sites. 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information. We will not provide or sell user-specific demographic information to any other person or business. We will only share this information on an aggregate basis. 

Our site uses cookies (user data collectors) to keep track of your shopping cart. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, and for other purposes.

**_Advertising_**

Rivals.com works with a third party that serves ads to this site. To find out more about how Flycast manages the privacy of information in conjunction with serving ads on this site, please go to <http://www.flycast.com/about_us/about-privacy.html>. 

**_Registration Form_**

Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, gender or income level). We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the selected user information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data for other purposes, such as tailoring the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. This information is shared with advertisers, but ONLY on an aggregate basis. We will NEVER share your address and personal data with any advertiser unless you specifically opt-in to one of our/their programs (a sweepstakes, for example). The choice to specifically identify yourself to an advertiser will always be yours. We will occasionally email you items of interest from some of our advertisers. You will have the opportunity to opt-out of such programs, and once again, your email name and personal information are never shared with those advertisers unless you choose to identify yourself to them by participating in offers that interest you.
