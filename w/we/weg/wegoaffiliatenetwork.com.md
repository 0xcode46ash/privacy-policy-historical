# Privacy Policy

## **What the Wego Privacy Policy Covers**

The Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information that we collect when you are on a site, web portal or web pages operated or owned by Wego or affiliated with Wego (“ **Wego  Site**“), and when you use our services.

When using a Wego site, you may also use the services offered by other parties. In particular, payment systems are provided by third parties and the information you provide to facilitate payment are collected by such third parties and not Wego. This Wego Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to people that we do not employ or manage. Please check the privacy practices of these other companies or persons (if any) to understand how they treat the personally identifiable information that you provide to them and contact them if you have any concerns.

## **Information Collection and Use by Wego**

We collect personally identifiable information when you create an account with us or register to receive email newsletters or other offers and promotions. Once you register with us, theoretically you are no longer anonymous to us. In addition, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Wego cookie information and the page you requested.

We use information for three general purposes: to customise the advertising and content you see, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to contact you about specials and new products by sending you email alerts for new products, features, enhancements, special offers, contests, events of interest, and one-off marketing promotions. Such alerts may include marketing information about Wego, our subsidiaries or selected business partners.

## **Opt Out from Marketing Information**

Any email we send to you will contain an easy automated unsubscribe link so that you can opt-out of the subscription. Simply follow the indications in the email.

## **Information Sharing and Disclosure by Wego**

We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone. We will send personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people only when:

  * We have your consent to share the information;
  * We need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested;
  * We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of us to provide a product or service to you. (Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.);
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; or
  * We find that your actions on our web sites violate the Wego Terms of Service, or any of our usage guidelines for specific products or services.
