# Wego.com

The Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information that we collect when you are on the Wego site, and when you use our services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to people that we do not employ or manage. 

## Information Collection and Use by Wego

We collect personally identifiable information when you register to create a personal Wego account, when you visit Wego pages, and when you enter information to receive email newsletters or other offers and promotions. When you register with us, we ask for your name, email address, birth date, gender, postal code, occupation, industry, how often you travel and where you most frequently travel to. Once you register with us and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. We also automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Wego cookie information and the page you requested. We use information for three general purposes: to customise the advertising and content you see, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to contact you about specials and new products.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure by Wego

We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone. We will send personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people when: 

  * We have your consent to share the information;
  * We need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested;
  * We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of us to provide a product or service to you. (Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.);
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; or
  * We find that your actions on our web sites violate the Wego Terms of Service, or any of our usage guidelines for specific products or services.



## Your ability to edit your account information and preferences

We give you the ability to edit your Wego Account Information and preferences at any time, including whether you want us to contact you about specials and new products. 

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may amend this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information we will notify you by posting a prominent announcement on our pages. You agree that such posting will constitute sufficient and adequate notice to you of the changes. You agree that your continued use of our products or services after such amendment will constitute your acceptance of and agreement to be bound by the modified policy.
