# We-Care.com :: Privacy Policy

We-Care.com knows that you care about how your information about you is handled. We value your trust and are committed to using private data respectfully and transparently.

We-Care.comis wholly owned by Internet Marketing Group, Ltd. Any provisions of this policy that apply to We-Care.com also apply to Internet Marketing Group, Ltd. For the purposes of this policy, "we" refers to We-Care.com and the "site" refers to any of We-Care.com's websites.

We-Care.com collects limited amounts of personal information. This information allows us to provide you with an optimal experience on our site and ensures that donations are properly credited and promptly paid. If you choose to participate in our optional registration, information we collect also allows us to store your preferences, contact you by email, and provide you with a record of your donations. 

Though some We-Care.com sites are co-branded with nonprofits, schools, and associations, the sites are owned and operated by We-Care.com. Any information collected is owned by We-Care.com and is not shared with co-branding partners except as noted below.

We-Care.com does not sell your private information. 

We-Care.com allows our visitors the option of registering, allowing them to take advantage of enhanced features. Registration is completely optional. The amount of information we collect depends on whether or not you decide to register.

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files, regardless of whether or not you register. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and what pages visitors use and what order they use them in. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

If you choose to register, we also collect information you provide us, such as your name, email address, country, and postal code. We use this information for the following reasons:

  * **To provide you with a record of your donations.** Registered users can view their account at anytime to see a list of their transactions and how much they've donated. ****
  * **To set site preferences.** We are continually enhancing our site to provide users with a more customized experience. Your account contains a record of your site preferences — including the organization to which you are donating — so that you do not need to reset them on each visit or when you access the Site from different computers. ****
  * **To provide you with information.** We send out periodic emails to announce changes in our services or alert you to special deals. (See Emails below.) ****



We also store other information you provide us, such as email inquiries sent to us. That information is only used for purposes for which it is provided.

We-Care.com allows visitors to donate a portion of their purchases from participating merchants to the nonprofit, school, or association (collectively known as Causes) of their choice. 

Causes may be submitted by representatives from the organization or by supporters. (Please note that when a Cause is added by a supporter, We-Care.com does not have a formal relationship with the organization. When a representative from the Cause applies for inclusion in We-Care.com, they are entering into a formal relationship with We-Care.com that allows for co-branding and co-promotions. Please see our [Terms of Service](http://www.we-care.com/TOS) for more details on these relationships.)

  * When a Cause is submitted by a supporter, we require a name and email address from that person so we can contact them if there are any questions about the Cause they are submitting and to alert them once their Cause has been successfully added to We-Care.com.
  * When a Cause is submitted by an official representative of the organization, we require their name and email address, along with the following organizational information: phone number, mailing address, type of organization (selected from a drop-down menu), tax ID, and URL (if available). This information allows us to work with the Cause in order to set up their We-Care.com site and to provide payments to the Cause when money accrues.)



If you are registered, we will occasionally send you information on special offers — generally deals that can save you money or provide a particularly high donation to your cause. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications through an opt-out link at the bottom of each email. At any time, you can change your email preferences by visiting the My Account section of the site.

If you are registered, we will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature, as they are necessary for using the site. 

We-Care.com uses cookies to provide you with a more customized experience and ensure that your donations are credited to the intended organizations. 

Cookies are small pieces of information stored by your browser. Only We-Care.com can access cookies we set. Though they do not contain any personally identifiable information (e.g., your name or email address), they do contain a unique user ID and IDs for the causes you have supported through We-Care.com. If you choose to register, the user ID is also linked to your account, allowing you to track your donations.

We also employ a software technology called clear gifs. Clear gifs contain no personally identifiable information, but do have a unique identifier that tracks the online movements. These are used for two purposes: 1) To help learn how visitors are using our site so that we can improve our site. 2) Let merchants know when and how often their coupons and offers are displayed.

We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. 

If you are registered with our site, we may tie the information gathered through clear gifs to your account to help us provide a better user experience.

We never sell personally identifiable information. 

We don't share personally identifiable information with third parties except under the following conditions:

  * We-Care.com may share personally identifiable information with third parties that perform functions on our behalf. Examples include sending email, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, and providing customer service. They have access to this data only to perform their operational or other support functions and may not use it for other purposes.
  * Registered members can request that their information is shared with the Causes they support through We-Care.com. Choosing to do this allows your Cause to build a more personal relationship with you and keep you up to date with its work. This is optional and you can choose whether or not we share your information when you register with We-Care.com. You can change this option at any time, but any information shared with organizations you support cannot be withdrawn after it has been submitted. 
  * We-Care.com may provide information to regulatory authorities and law enforcement officials in accordance with applicable law or when we otherwise believe in good faith that the law requires it.
  * In the event of a sale of all or part of our businesses, we may transfer user information related to that business to the new owner as part of the transaction.



We-Care.com may use, share, and publish aggregated data in forms that do not include personally identifiable information. This data may be used for improving our services, helping the organizations we work with better serve their supporters, and marketing purposes.

Our Privacy Policy only applies to information gathered by We-Care.com.

When you leave the Site to visit one of our merchants, you are leaving We-Care.com and visiting the merchant's website. They may use cookies on their site for purposes that include identifying you as a visitor from We-Care.com in order to pay the commission on your purchase. (These commissions are the source of all donations we make on your behalf.) Many merchants also use a third-party "affiliate network" to do this on their behalf. We do not provide any personally identifiable information to the merchant or their affiliate network. Any information you provide to them is governed by their privacy policies.

The Site also contains links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by us — most commonly links to Causes. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such websites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of every website that collects personally identifiable information.

The security of your personal information is important to us. We collect only a minimal amount of personally identifiable information, and we work hard to protect it. 

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Though we use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we shall not be responsible for any actual or consequential damages that result from a lapse in compliance with this Privacy Policy as a result of a security breach or technical malfunction.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we may also notify you by email or by means of a notice on our homepage.

If you have questions or suggestions about our privacy policy or wish to correct, change, or verify any personal information we have about you, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/About/ContactUs?subject=Privacy+Policy).
