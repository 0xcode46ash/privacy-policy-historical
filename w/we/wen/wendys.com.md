Wendy's strongly encourages all parents to supervise their children's on-line activities and regularly monitor their children's use of the Internet. Parents should consider using parental control tools and other services to assist them in supervising their children's on-line use or on-line disclosure of their name, address or other personal information without parental consent.

Wendy's reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes.
