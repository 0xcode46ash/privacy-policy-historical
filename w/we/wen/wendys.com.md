  6. Tracking Technologies (Cookies) 

When you visit the Site, we and our business partners may use tracking technologies to enhance your online experience or customize our offerings.

A few additional important things you should know about our use of tracking technologies (cookies):

    * We offer certain features that are available only through the use of tracking technologies.
    * We use both session and persistent tracking technologies. Tracking technologies (e.g. cookies) can either be persistent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser). You are always free to decline tracking technologies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of the Site. Refer to the help section of your browser, browser extensions, or installed applications for instructions on blocking, deleting, or disabling tracking technologies such as cookies.
    * We encode and protect the tracking technologies that Wendy’s sets, so that only we can interpret the information stored in them.
    * You may encounter tracking technologies/cookies from our third-party service providers that we have allowed on our site that assist us with various aspects of our web site operations and services, such as [Google Analytics](https://www.wendys.com/en-us/cookie-policy?_ga=1.96799450.410286095.1477944982).
    * You also may encounter tracking technologies from third-parties on certain pages of the websites that we do not control and have not authorized (e.g., if you view a web page created by another user, there may be a cookie placed by that web page).
    * We may target and track the videos you view on the Site. You consent to our tracking of your video viewing through the Site or third-party social media for up to two years or as permitted by applicable law.

For more information about the use of cookies and similar technology on our online services, please review this Privacy Policy and our [Cookies and Tracking Technologies Policy](https://www.wendys.com/en-us/cookie-policy?_ga=1.96799450.410286095.1477944982).  
 

  7. Accessing, Reviewing, and Changing Your Personal Information 

Registered members can review and change personal information at any time by accessing their accounts on the Site. You should promptly update your personal information if it changes or becomes inaccurate. We may retain some information from closed accounts so that we can comply with law, prevent fraud, assist with investigations, resolve disputes, analyze or troubleshoot programs, enforce our Terms of Use, or take other actions permitted by law. We may also retain certain transaction history and other non-personal information to analyze user behavior. Likewise if your account or membership is terminated or suspended, we may maintain some information to prevent re-registration. Unfortunately, if you close your account, we cannot reactivate it, but you are always welcome to open a new one.  
 

  8. Notice to California Residents 
    1. Residents of the State of California may request a list of all third-parties to which our online service has disclosed certain personal information (as defined by California law) during the preceding year for those third-parties’ direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and want such a list, please contact us at: Wendy’s International, LLC, One Dave Thomas Boulevard, Dublin, OH 43017, Attn: General Counsel, Legal Department. For all requests, you must put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in the body of your request, as well as your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. In the body of your request, please provide enough information for us to determine if this applies to you. You need to attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response. Please note that we will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information.
    2. **How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals for California Residents.** California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how Wendy’s responds to “Do Not Track” browser settings. Wendy’s does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.
  9. Third-Parties 

Our Site may contain links to other third-party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these third-party sites.  
 

  10. Security 

We store and process your information on our servers located in the United States and around the world. We protect your personal information using technical and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use include data encryption, firewalls, regular security assessments of IT infrastructure, access controls to physical, network-based and data assets. It is your responsibility to make sure that your personal information is accurate and that your passwords and account registration information is secure and not shared with third parties.  
 

  11. Children's Privacy 

The Site is a general audience site and it is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information via our websites, applications, services, or tools from users in this age group. If you believe your child has provided personal information to us, please contact us via the email listed in [Section 14](https://www.wendys.com/en-us/privacy-policy#section_14-4) below.  
 

  12. International Transfer 

As we operate internationally, and many of our computer systems are currently based in the United States, your personal information may be processed in the U.S. and elsewhere where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you create an account/profile, you consent to the collection and/or processing in the United States of your personal information and tracking technologies/cookies as described in this Privacy Policy.  
 

  13. Notification Regarding Updates 

From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy. You agree that we may notify you about material changes in the way we treat personal information by placing a notice on the Site. You should check the Site frequently for updates. If we or any third-party we disclose your personal information to is required to provide notice of a security breach, you consent to receiving notice through this Site or via the email address you have provided to us, at our discretion.
