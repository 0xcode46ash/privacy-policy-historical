**WetFeet.com's Privacy Policy**  
WetFeet.com has created this privacy policy to demonstrate our strong commitment to privacy. The following statement explains our information-gathering and 

-dissemination practices for our site on the World Wide Web at [www.wetfeet.com](http://www.wetfeet.com/) (the "Site"). This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically. 

**Your Privacy**  
When we gather information from insiders for Insider Guides and other career research products, we work hard to provide them anonymity. They are understandably concerned about their privacy, and we go to great lengths to ensure that their identity is never released by WetFeet.com to anyone outside of WetFeet.com. 

WetFeet.com values your privacy too. We only request information absolutely essential to the filling of your order or to understand you better so that we can improve our products and services. We will not release name or contact information to third parties without your consent, unless, of course, you're submitting your identity for a purchase from our Site with a credit card. In that case, we will share necessary billing information information with our credit car processor and shipping information with the shipper you designate. Billing information is sent from WetFeet to our credit card processor, CyberCash. We do not store your payment information on our site; it resides on the secure servers of CyberCash indefinitely. Since WetFeet keeps on hand every title we sell, we do not share your information with any publisher or distributor of non-WetFeet titles.

However, we may comply with any subpoena, order of court, or request by a regulatory or law enforcement agency to gain access to any of the information that we collect.

**Online Forums**  
WetFeet.com offers Online Forums to its members. While WetFeet.com strives to protect your personal information, we cannot provide security for any of the information that you choose to submit to the Forums, as they are essentially open to the public. Please exercise good judgement and protect your passwords and other account information.

Cookies allow us to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our Site. Cookies also help to optimize the user experience in our Online Forums by recognizing your username and flagging new forum activity since your last visit. We use this information for internal use only; we don't share it with others. 

**E-Insider Electronic Newsletter**
