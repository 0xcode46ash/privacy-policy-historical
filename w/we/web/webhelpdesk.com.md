# Privacy Policy | Web Help Desk

**Please Read Carefully Prior To Using This Website**

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Statement describes the types of information SolarWinds Worldwide, LLC and its subsidiaries ("SolarWinds") collect from and about you when you visit our website ("Website") and identifies how SolarWinds may use and share such information as well as your ability to control certain uses of it. 

  1. Data Collection   
_Information You Provide to Us._ SolarWinds collects information from you when you choose to provide it to us. Any information that is provided by you to us via the Website or otherwise will be treated in accordance applicable data protection law. Such information may be provided to us when you download and install a product for evaluation or trial, download and install a free tool, request a quote from us, purchase or register a product, sign up for newsletters, white papers, our email list, or other assets offered by SolarWinds, create a user account on our Website, customer portal or community forum, submit a customer service or technical support ticket, or otherwise contact us. The personal information we collect may include your name, address, email address, telephone number, screen or user name, information about the products that you own and use, or—if you’re a SolarWinds customer—your payment information. You may be required to provide certain information to create your account or complete your purchase for certain jurisdictions. If you use a third party login to create your account or otherwise link to us, we may receive certain information about you from the third party (such as social network) based on your registration and privacy settings on that third party service.   
_Information We Automatically Collect._ SolarWinds may use cookies, web beacons, or other technologies to automatically collect certain information when you visit our Website, interact with our emails, within the SolarWinds products, or in online advertisements. A cookie, also known as an HTTP cookie, web cookie, or browser cookie, is usually a small piece of data sent from the Website and stored in a user's web browser while a user is browsing the Website. Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember the state of the website or activity the user had taken in the past. This can include automatically collecting information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, software version, referrer ID and the domain from which you accessed the Website. When the user browses the Website in the future, the data stored in the cookie can be retrieved by the Website to notify the Website of the user's previous activity. SolarWinds also may collect information about your use of the Website, such as the time you spend using the Website, the number of times you return, whether you click-through, open, or forward links, emails, and ads, and other Website usage data.   
Other kinds of cookies include authentication cookies, which are the most common method used by web servers to recognise whether the user is logged in or not and the account they are logged in under. Without such a mechanism, the Website would not know whether it is authorized to send a page containing sensitive information or whether it should require a user to authenticate himself/herself by logging-in.   
SolarWinds uses cookies that are hosted internally and that are provided by service providers to analyze users’ usage of the Website. This facilitates on-going improvements to the Website and improves the customer experience with SolarWinds and its products. We also use cookies that are hosted internally to allow users to authenticate themselves on successive visits to the Website. This allows users to gain access to authorised content.
