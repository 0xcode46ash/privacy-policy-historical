### WebYield Privacy Statement

Recently, many people have raised concerns about the issue of privacy on the Internet. The Web is an extraordinary medium—it breaks down physical, ethnic, and social barriers and allows us to communicate and interact as citizens of a unified, digital world; however, with such openness and ease of access comes potential for abuse. 

Because of this potential for abuse, the Federal Government is considering regulation to protect online consumers. Specifically, regulators are concerned that online marketers are not adequately disclosing their information practices. One question being asked is whether consumers are aware of what happens to information that may be collected about them when they visit a website or purchase a product online. While the government may have the best of intentions, federal regulations could stifle the growth of the Internet, restrict the use of certain types of information collected (which has the potential of diminishing the user experience), and set a dangerous precedent for future regulation.

In order to make the Web a safe place for commerce and communication while allowing it to expand and flourish, an industry-wide call for self-regulation has been made. The management and associates of WebYield. believe in the still-untapped potential of the Web; we are concerned about making it a safe place for users and at the same time allowing for the continued growth of the medium. In support of this belief, we are freely disclosing the nature and purpose of information we collect via our website. 

Through the normal course of serving up pages, our Web server creates a log file, recording specific information each time a request is made. (A request is defined as a call to the server to download a file or perform an action.) Specifically, the information captured includes:

* IP (Internet Protocol) Address of the individual computer (or proxy server) making the request 
* The date and time the request is made 
* The referring URL 
* and the user-agent (the browser and operating system the user has) 

This information is collected into a text file, but the raw data alone does not tell us much. In order to make sense of the it, we use a software program which analyzes the log file in aggregate form. The results of the analysis yield quite a bit more information.

For example, since all IP Addresses are licensed to a specific domain (such as resource.com or apple.com), the software can track an individual IP Address back to the domain from which a request originated. Even though we can determine what domain a user is coming from, we have no way of figuring out precisely who that user is.

The software also reports the most frequently accessed areas of our site; the busiest days of the week and times of day during which the site is visited; what links users are following to reach our site; and the type and version of browser and operating system visitors use. This information allows us to learn about our customer base as a whole, helping us to get a better understanding of how people are using our website. Again, all the information we collect via server log files is used in aggregate form only—we do not attempt, in any way, to analyze information for a single visitor. In addition, this information is used for internal purposes only; we have no intention of sharing it with third-parties.
