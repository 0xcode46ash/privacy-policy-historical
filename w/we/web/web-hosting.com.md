This policy sets for the manner in which Web Host Plus gathers, processes, stores and organizes the information provided by our users as they visit our website. Being in an evolving technological environment, we must all understand that with technology there is change and as such Web Host Plus will use its best efforts to afford its customers and users the newest developments in privacy protection. Like all of our standards, this policy too may change from time to time so we ask that you review these policies each time you visit our website.

No matter what type of information that is provided through the Web Host Plus website, Web Host Plus will protect the confidentiality of its customer's information, account information and personal information to the fullest extent possible. However, please note that information, irrespective of type, once disclosed to a public arena (such as chat rooms or third party sites) can not be guaranteed by the protection of Web Host Plus.

Unless otherwise instructed by you, Web Host Plus may often use this information for promotional purposes, advising you of new services and products, and improving upon the services we provide to our customers. All of your credit card and purchasing information is highly secured through commercially acceptable web based security and encryption protocols.

Children under the age of 18 are prohibited from using our services without the consent of a parent or guardian. However, it must be noted that Web Host Plus has no way of knowing if a visitor or customer is actually under the age of 18. Therefore, it's entirely possible that we may collect, use and disclose information about users under the age of 18. We encourage parents to monitor their child's use of the Internet and advise those users under the age of 18 to obtain parental or guardian consent before disclosing any information.Exceptions  
Web Host Plus will not disclose any personal information of its customer unless there is reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, make contact with, or bring legal action against someone which may be causing harm or interfering with the rights or property of Web Host Plus, Web Host Plus's customers, or others, or where Web Host Plus has good faith belief that the law requires such disclosure. In addition, Web Host Plus will not disclose or monitor any content (personal or private electronic communications transmitted to Web Host Plus) unless it is (i) necessary to provide service to the customer; (ii) to protect the interest of Web Host Plus; (iii) required to cooperate with orders, warrants, subpoenas, or other legal process that Web Host Plus determines in its sole discretion to be valid and enforceable and (iv) necessary to provide to law enforcement agency when the contents are inadvertently obtained by Web Host Plus and appear to pertain to the commission of a crime.By using this site, you agree not to write or post any fraudulent or illegal messages as part of any e-mail, forum, chat, or other Web Host Plus-related electronic communications medium.
