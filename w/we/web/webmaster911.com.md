# Privacy Policy

**ClickSouth.Net considers the safeguarding of your personal information as our highest priority.**

Use of Information: ClickSouth.Net is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. 

Cookies: Cookies may be used on this site to allow for movement between secure sections. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site.

Log Files: We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

Links: This website may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that ClickSouth.Net is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Website.

Surveys & Contests: From time to time, our site may request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

Security: ClickSouth.Net takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/login forms ask users to enter sensitive information (such as account information), that information is encrypted and is protected with the most widely used encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL, follow this link www.ssl.com

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information off-line. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices and our service provider's offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our technical team or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.

Final Overview: ClickSouth.Net does not provide access, will not provide access and has no intentions of ever providing access of any customer information to a third party, ever. We protect our customers right to privacy at all costs. Period.
