Registration   
WebPartner's customer registration requires users to give us contact information (e.g., name and email address) as well as financial information (e.g. credit card numbers). We use financial information to bill the user. We use contact information to create the user's account and to send relevant information within our weekly email summaries. Customer information is also used to contact the user when necessary. During registration we collect a password that is only used to secure the customer's registration data. We do not share our customer information (including user email addresses) with other companies except where required by law. We do not sell or rent our customer information. We reserve the right to share broad demographic data with third parties.

Log Files  
When a person browses <http://www.webpartner.com/> or accesses the user interface, our web server collects the IP address, browser type and the computer name (if available) from the computer used by the customer. This is standard information collected by web servers and is not tied back to any personal account information stored by WebPartner. Rather, the information is used for statistical analysis of the traffic to <http://www.webpartner.com/>.

Data Gathering  
Website data is collected when WebPartner's automated software agents monitor the performance of customer-designated URLs. The WebPartner server collects the IP address and hostname of the target URL. It also gathers statistical performance data such as the response time of the URL and the time it takes to completely download the specified URL.

Cookies  
A cookie is passed to the user's browser from our web servers in order to track repeat browser sessions and "click-stream" information (the path that the user took through the website). The information collected through the use of cookies is standard information that a web server collects. A user can refuse any cookie passed to it by the WebPartner web server, with no reduction in usability of the report center or WebPartner services. To disable cookies, consult your web browser's help screens or users guide.

Email  
Communications After registering, a new user receives an email to confirm registration. Alert emails are sent when WebPartner detects a problem with a monitored URL and the user has selected to receive email or pager alerts. If a problem persists, these emails are sent at a frequency determined by the user. At any time, a user can opt not to receive these alerts by re-configuring his or her account preferences. Once a week a summary report (text email) containing various performance and benchmark metrics for a user's selected URLs is sent to all registered users. In the event that a user account is terminated, WebPartner sends a confirmation email.

Security  
The WebPartner website has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under its control. Information collected during registration is protected by the username/password combination entered by the user. WebPartner utilizes an https secure connection for credit card processing.
