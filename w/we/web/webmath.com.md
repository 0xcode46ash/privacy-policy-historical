# Privacy Policy - DiscoverySchool.com

**DISCOVERY KIDS AND STUDENTS PRIVACY POLICY**

The areas of Discovery.com oriented to children, including DiscoveryKids.com, Discovery Kids Latin America, and the Students area of DiscoverySchool.com, want kids and their parents to understand the ways in which we will use information that kids under the age of thirteen provide when they visit our Web sites. Discovery.com encourages children and their parents, teachers and other caregivers to spend time together online and participate in the activities offered on our site. Federal law requires Web sites that collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen to first get parental consent, and children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. When using Discovery.com, you can be sure that: 

  * We do NOT knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. We screen users who wish to provide personal information in order to prevent users under the age of thirteen from providing such information. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of thirteen, we will delete such information from our records. If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. When you visit our sites, we might ask if you want to tell us other things about yourself that do not identify you personally (for example, your age, your state of residence, your hobbies, and features you would like to see on DiscoveryKids.com, Discovery Kids Latin America and DiscoverySchool.com). 
  * Because we do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen, we also do NOT knowingly distribute such information to third parties. 



**Questions on Privacy:**  
This site is operated by Discovery.com. If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy or your dealings with Discovery.com, please contact us by: 

**Cookies:**  
We use "cookies" when visitors access our sites, but we will not use them to obtain or track any personally identifying information about you. Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to the hard drive of a computer. They allow us to keep track of when and how kids visit our sites. We use cookies to figure out the stuff on our sites people like best. We can then update our sites in the future based on what we learn about the types of activities and information visitors want to see. 

**Bulletin Boards:**  
From time to time, we may offer bulletin boards, on which kids can interact with one another and with special Discovery guests. The boards are anonymous -- so please be sure you use only your DiscoveryKids.com, Discovery Kids Latin America or DiscoverySchool.com screen name or ID, not your real name, and don't post any personal information (such as your address or phone number). You should keep in mind these basic rules when sharing your stories on the bulletin boards: 

  * Any time you post information online you should clear it first with your parents. It's always a good idea to let your parents know what you are up to at DiscoveryKids.com, Discovery Kids Latin America and DiscoverySchool.com. 
  * If we become aware that we have inadvertently posted a submission that contains personally identifying information (such as your name, address or phone number), we will remove the submission from our site and delete it from our servers. 
  * Language or content that is inappropriate for kids will also be removed from the bulletin boards. By inappropriate, we mean stuff that is not for kids. If we become aware that we have inadvertently posted a submission that contains inappropriate stuff or stuff that is unrelated to DiscoveryKids.com, Discovery Kids Latin America or DiscoverySchool.com, we will remove the submission from our site and delete it from our servers. 



**Links to Other Sites:**  
DiscoveryKids.com, Discovery Kids Latin America and DiscoverySchool.com may include advertisers' links or other links to external sites. These sites are not part of our Web site services and are not under our control. These sites may have different policies relating to your privacy and information they collect about you. We strongly encourage all kids to get a parent's permission before giving out any information about themselves to any other person or Web site. 

**Sweepstakes and Contests:**  
From time to time, Discovery.com may offer contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (collectively "contests") on our sites. If you enter a contest, you'll have to provide information about yourself (such as your name, address, and email address) so that we can contact you if you win. We may share this information with any co-sponsor of the contest (as identified in the rules). If you don't want us to collect the information requested in the contest registration form or to provide it to contest co-sponsors, please don't enter the contest. 

**Questions and Changes:**  
The Web is a quickly changing environment. We may need to change this privacy policy at some point in the future. You should check back here to learn of any changes we make to the policy in the future.
