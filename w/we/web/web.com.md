If they do not receive acknowledgment of their inquiry or their inquiry is not satisfactorily addressed, they should then contact TRUSTe through the TRUSTe Watchdog Dispute Resolution Process (<http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php>).

Information Collection and Use  
In some cases, Web.com is the sole owner of the information collected on Web.com. Web.com collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site.

Registration  
WEB.COM has entered into an agreement with an accredited domain name registrar, Tucows,Inc. ("TUCOWS") to provide Customers with domain name registration services, for any requests by Customer to WEB.COM to register an Internet domain name. Web.com shares with TUCOWS only that data which is necessary to complete the transaction requested by the customer. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact the user about services on our site in which he has expressed interest.  It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site. 

Order  
We request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and mailing address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date).  This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders.  If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user.  

Use of your Personal Information  
Web.com collects and uses your personal information to operate Web.com and deliver the Services you have requested. These Services may include the display of customized content and advertising based upon the information we have collected. In order to provide Services in conjunction with other Web.com products or services, personal information collected on Web.com may be accessed and used by other Web.com Services as necessary to provide such services. Any use of such information within Web.com will remain subject to the limitations of this privacy statement. 

We also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements. Some Web.com services, including Web.com Hosting and Web.com Mail, may send periodic member letters that are considered part of the service. We may also occasionally send you product surveys or promotional mailings to inform you of other products or services available from Web.com and its affiliates. 

Web.com does not sell, rent or lease its Web.com customer lists to third parties. We may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your personal information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent. 

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. 

Web.com may access and/or disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Web.com or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Web.com, including the Web.com family of Web sites; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Web.com services or members of the public. 

Personal information collected on this site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Web.com or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. Web.com abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. 

Your California Privacy Rights   
In addition to the information provided elsewhere in this privacy policy, the following applies only to California residents.

Web.com may, from time to time, share your personally identifiable information with unaffiliated third parties for their direct marketing purposes. As a California resident, you have a legal right to request and receive in writing or by email the names and addresses of all such third parties who received your personally identifiable information during the previous calendar year and a list of the types of personally identifiable information disclosed to such third parties. To request such information, send an email to [privacy@web.com](mailto:privacy@web.com) or write to California Privacy Information c/o Web.com, 6 Berkshire Blvd., Bethel, CT 06801 or fax to (203)448-2022. We will not honor such request more than once per calendar year.

Cookies  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user.  Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.  We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates.  A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. For further information on cookies, refer to <http://www.microsoft.com/ie>, or <http://browsers.netscape.com/browsers/main.tmpl>.

Cookies are used on our website to track session-relevant information during the registration process. Users of Web.com's WebMail service may elect to use a persistent cookie to store their Web.com ID and Password for faster logins in future sessions. By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.  If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site.  The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. None of our business partners use cookies on our site.

Third Party Advertising  
Web.com does not display Third Party Advertising on the Web.com site. 

Log Files  
Like most standard Web site servers we use log files.  This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.

Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)  
We sometimes employ Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs) to track the efficiency of various advertising campaigns. Clear gif usage is limited to non-personal or aggregate analysis of traffic on the site.  

Communications from the Site  
Special Offers and Updates  
We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive future email communications with each communication.  

Service Announcements  
On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement.  For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email.  Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account.  However, these communications are not promotional in nature. 

Customer Service  
We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the users wishes.

Sharing Legal Disclaimer  
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site. We DO NOT Share Personal Information with Third Parties, except for Third Party Intermediaries, Service Providers (e.g. as necessary to perform the service of our site) listed below. Third Party Intermediaries  
We use outside credit card processing companies to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

Service Providers  
We partner with TUCOWS, Inc. to provide Domain Name Registration services.  When the user signs up for these particular services, we share name, mailing address, email address, and phone number as this information is necessary for TUCOWS, Inc. to provide these services.  TUCOWS, Inc. is not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.  However, please understand that as part of domain name registration certain contact information is eventually published in the public "whois" database according to appropriate rules and regulations as put forth by ICANN.org. 

Business Transitions  
In the event Web.com goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.  Users will be notified via email, and/or prominent notice on our Web site login pages for 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section.

Choice/Opt-out  
Users who no longer wish to receive any Web.com promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or the user may contact us at [privacy@web.com](mailto:privacy@web.com). Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties.  We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party.

Links  
This Web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Web.com, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

Surveys & Contests  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically includes contact information such as name and email address, and demographic information, such as zip code.  Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.  Anonymous Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.  Users' personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and choice. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users' personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

Tell-A-Friend  
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address.  Web.com will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site.  Web.com stores this information only as necessary to send this one-time email and track the function of our referral program. 

Security  
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information.  When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.  
When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information, such as credit card number, that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.  While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'.  To learn more about SSL, follow this link [http://www.verisign.com](http://www.verisign.com/). 

  While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.  All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.  Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk.  When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to user information.  Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected.  Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, behind a locked cage in a locked facility. If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send an email to [privacy@web.com](mailto:privacy@web.com).

Supplementation of Information  
In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.

Credit Check  
For example, to determine if users qualify for payment terms, we may use their name and social security number to request a credit report.  Once we determine a user's credit-worthiness, this document is destroyed.

IP Verification  
We use our proprietary software applications to verify a user's IP Address to confirm purchases made online.

Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information   
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can be done by opening a Customer Support ticket at [support.web.com](http://support.web.com/), or by calling Web.com Customer Support at 203-448-2021.

Notification of Changes  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.  However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner.  In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices
