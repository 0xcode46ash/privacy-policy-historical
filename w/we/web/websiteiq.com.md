|  **Your Privacy Matters to Website I.Q.!**

Website I.Q. has created this privacy statement to demonstrate our commitment to privacy and to outline how we plan to handle such information. The following describes our information gathering and usage practices for www.websiteiq.com.

You can be assured that if you provide information to Website I.Q., no individual data will be passed on to any third-party. Website I.Q. will only divulge information as may be necessary to comply with state and federal laws.

On occasion, Website I.Q. conducts online surveys that ask visitors for contact information (such as email address) and demographic information (such as zip code, age, or income level). Survey results provide information that enables us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers better understand the aggregate demographics of our audience. Data may be used in aggregate form to learn more about our customers' needs, however, individual personal data will never be released from these surveys.

Website I.Q. provides a free email newsletter that covers subjects related to safe, easy, online shopping. Subscription to our newsletter is optional and requires you to reply to a confirmation email indicating your desire to subscribe. Users may opt-in for the newsletter by clicking on the checkbox on the "subscribe to newsletter" option. Users can decline this service by leaving the checkbox unchecked or by choosing not to reply to the confirmation message. If users decide to unsubscribe, it is an easy one step process.

Website I.Q. may occasionally sponsor a sweepstakes, contest or giveaways. In these cases, Website I.Q. will require name, mailing address, and email address. Should you choose to participate, we will notify you via email of the result.

Website I.Q. occasionally sends informational or promotional mailings related to our services. These mailings provide information about our services, and may offer shopping discounts. If a user does not wish to receive this type of information, they may elect to remove their address.

Website I.Q. may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions and see what the audience thinks about important issues. Website I.Q. uses a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users.

This site contains links to other websites. Website I.Q. is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these sites. If you have concerns about how other websites collect and use information about you, make sure to read that site’s own privacy policy.
