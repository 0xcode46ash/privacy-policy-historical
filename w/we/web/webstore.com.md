# - WebStore

Unlike typical online classifieds, forums, and groups where your email address and possibly other personal information is available to all, at Webstore we take your privacy very seriously. 

At Webstore: 

Only when you have entered into a transaction by agreement to buy or sell with another registered Webstore member is your information made available; and even then, your information is only made available to the other person involved in the transaction.

Other Online Classifieds Services:

Ever wonder why you get so much spam in your mailbox? Posting in online classifieds often requires that you display your email address or other personal information where spammers and email collection agencies have easy access to your personal information. 

Additional privacy at Webstore:

At Webstore we believe your business is no one else's. Webstore follows the following principles in accordance with world-wide practices for customer privacy and data protection. 

  * We won't sell or give away your name, mail address, phone number, email address, or any other information to anyone. 
  * We'll use the latest security measures to protect your information from unauthorized users. 




Access:

We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current. You may review and update this information at any time in the member area. There, you can view and edit personal information you have on file with us.
