# WebAssist :: Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy  
**WebAssist and your privacy**   
At WebAssist we respect your right to privacy and we understand that, as a visitor to our web site, you prefer to control your own personal information and preferences. For this reason, we may ask you to register or to provide personal information and preferences when you visit certain areas of WebAssist.com, download software, request information, or subscribe to WebHelp Support. 

We will guard the personal information you share with us to ensure the content, services, and advertising that we provide on WebAssist.com (and related WebAssist sites) are always tailored to your current, designated preferences.

When you provide WebAssist with your name (or alias), e-mail address, mailing address, or telephone number, and you "opt in," WebAssist and WebAssist representatives may use the provided information to alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information, new services, and other WebAssist related information. ("Representatives" include value-added resellers, premier level partners, and authorized training partners.) WebAssist does not offer, or allow the selling of, any user-provided information to third parties.

WebAssist respects the rights users give us when opting to receive e-mail communications and enforces internal policies to preserve those rights. It is our objective to retain the long-term ability to continue to communicate with our users.

If you do not want WebAssist or WebAssist representatives to contact you, you may "opt out" of this preference at any time, whether you're online or contacting WebAssist directly. As part of your preference flexibility, you'll always have the option to opt back in and have WebAssist contact you based on your previous or new preferences. For instructions, please see the section "Contact Us," below.

If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still visit most WebAssist Web sites; however, you will not have access to areas that require personal identification.

**WebAssist membership and the use of log files (cookies)**  
WebAssist offers free membership to all WebAssist.com.com visitors. In order to establish membership, visitors are requested to provide both personal information and preferences. This information is stored and protected by your user-established Member ID and Password.

There is an additional "Remember me" option. By selecting it, you allow WebAssist to save your Member ID and Password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you return to any WebAssist Web site. WebAssist remembers you by placing a log file (cookie) that contains only enough information to identify you upon return visits. A "cookie" is a small line of text that is stored with your Web browser for record-keeping purposes and helps WebAssist provide better service to you. Your browser has options to accept, reject, or provide you with notice when a cookie is sent.

No information, other than that found in the Membership cookie, will be accessed by any WebAssist system. Access to your membership information always requires both your Member ID and Password.

**How WebAssist will protect your personal information**   
WebAssist will always protect the personal information that you share with us. WebAssist stores information internally in a controlled, secure environment. If, for example, you make a purchase online, we route all transactions through SSL (Secure Socket Layers) and will process your credit card number only to secure your current payment. The SSL transaction does not retain your credit card number subsequent to the transaction at hand and will not use the number for marketing purposes.

If WebAssist requests general demographic information, this information is limited to reporting purposes only; members remain anonymous. Phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and postal addresses are never shared for demographic reports with outside entities.

WebAssist may occasionally present a special contest or promotion that is sponsored by another company. To qualify for entry, we may ask you to provide personal information. If we plan to share that information with the sponsor(s), we will provide an up-front statement to that effect.

**How to update your personal information and preferences**   
You can help WebAssist maintain the accuracy of your personal information by notifying us when you change your name, address, title, phone number, e-mail address, or your content preferences. If at any time you wish to update your information or preferences, feel free to contact us at any time. 

**How to change your email preferences**   
WebAssist sends out important email messages about general news, updates, and promotions. Users may choose to opt-out of receiving these emails by logging into our site and updating your [personal preferences](http://www.webassist.com/members/personupdate.asp) to uncheck the "Receive Email Updates" checkbox.
