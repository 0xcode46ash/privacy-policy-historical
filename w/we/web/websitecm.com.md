# Privacy Policy - WebsiteCM

We hate spam and junk-mail as much as you do, and that's why we respect the privacy of our mailing list subscribers, customers, contacts, those who answer our surveys, those who fill out our questionnaires, and all other users of our site. It is our policy: 

  1. **Choice and Consent:** To respect the purpose for which our site visitors gave us information. We give users choice and consent over how their personal information is used, and remove names immediately upon request.  
 
  2. **Third Party Use:** To not sell, rent, or loan our subscriber or customer lists to third parties for e-mail marketing. While we sell advertising in our e-mail publications to other companies, we never allow third parties any other use of these subscriber lists.  
 
  3. **Unsubscriptions:** To send our periodicals only to those who request them (that is, opt-in). We immediately unsubscribe those who request it through convenient unsubscribe links in every e-mailing.  
 
  4. **Cookies:** To use cookies in a responsible manner to help our visitors, not snoop on them. We use cookies to: (a) to help rotate banner advertising; (b) to identify shoppers with their shopping carts; (c) to make it easy to order a second time; (d) to allow subscribers to store passwords in cookies if they desire; and (e) to give proper credit for sales made through links on our affiliates' sites. We do not collect or use information from cookies to develop a profile about our visitors or shoppers.  
 
  5. **Security:** To store subscriber and password files with personal information in a secure manner. We store such files in areas not accessible to Web browsers, behind password protection.
