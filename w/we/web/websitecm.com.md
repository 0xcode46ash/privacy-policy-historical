Testimonials

Another big thumbs up for Jon at Websitecm not only is his mod for CDSEO fantastic but he bent over backwards to help us out when we got shafted by our hosting company. This guy is the only guy we will be buying mods from now on. Some of the other people selling mods for X-cart should take a leaf out of his book because some of them really suck on support and professionalism.
