### Information about page views through WebWarper service

In order to collect statistics, and also to analyze WebWarper service operation, during every Web page view we do register the following information about user in special _log-files of WebWarper server_ : 

  * user's IP-address;
  * precise date and time of addressing the page;
  * address of a viewed page;
  * address of a page, user surfed to the given page from ( _Referrer_ );
  * type of a user's browser ( _User-Agent_ );
  * time characteristics, describing the process of loading a page to webwarper.net server, and its further compression.



Some statistic information, describing the number of views for pages with different types in some intervals of time, but not containing any personal data on users, is published openly on our Web site at [http://webwarper.net/wwlogs/](http://www.webwarper.net/ww/webwarper.net/wwlogs/).

Other information from log-files of WebWarper is also available on our site, but access to it is protected by standard Basic-scheme of HTTP-authorization. Besides that, [1-800-HOSTING](http://800hosting.com/) hosting company, from which we are renting dedicated computer for placing our webwarper.net server, does also have access to this information. Logins and passwords required to gain access to this information are known to SIAMS Company, and 1-800-HOSTING hosting company only.
