## Your privacy

## Updated 29 September 2011

By using WebElements, you consent to our practices as described here. At WebElements we are committed to protecting your online privacy. We use the information we collect about you to provide content which is tailored to your needs and to provide a useful service. All data entered by users are handled responsibly and with care by WebElements Ltd. 

## What information do we collect?

  * Email addresses: when and if you register on our site we will collect your e-mail address.
  * Geographical/personal information: we may gather more personal information when you register or when you move into a new area of the site. We may ask for your name, gender, zip code/postcode, occupation and personal interests. You do not have to provide this information.



## What are cookies and how do we use them?

_Cookies_ are small amounts of information that are sent from a web server to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. They contain information relating to the internet sites you have visited. We may use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you and to personalise your contact with us. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but you can usually change your browser to prevent this, although you may not be able to access some parts of the WebElements site without them. Your browser's help system should contain information and instructions relating to cookies, including their deletion if you wish.

## 3rd party sites and cookies

Third parties including Google may place and read cookies through your browser, to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website. WebElements does not interact with 3rd party cookies. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to WebElements users based on visits to WebElements and/or other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting Google's [advertising opt-out page](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

WebElements may provide links to third-party websites. If you use those links, you will leave the WebElements website. WebElements does not control those sites or their privacy practices and we do not endorse or make any representations about those websites. Our privacy policy does not cover personal data you give to unrelated third parties.

## How do we use your information?

If you consent, we will use the information you give us within WebElements and its associated companies to notify you occasionally about important changes to our site and new services, and about developments that we believe may be of interest to you.

We do not sell, trade or rent the information we get from you on this site to others. We may share statistical information with other organisations as part of our marketing. These statistics _will not_ include any personal identifying information. We collect these statistics by monitoring traffic on the site and using anonymous data. We can then construct a specific interest group which assists us in improving and marketing our site. We may disclose information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is:

  * reasonably necessary to comply with the law
  * needed to enforce or apply our terms of business
  * needed to protect our rights and those of our users



## E-mail

WebElements does not send unsolicited mass e-mail. You may choose ("opt in") to receive occasional e-mails from us relating to, for example, new products, special offers, site news, and other developments that we believe may be of interest to you. WebElements will never use e-mail to request or demand bank or other financial details from you, and any such messages you do receive should be regarded as forgeries. If you do receive such requests or demands for this type of information we should appreciate being informed so that we may contact the appropriate legal authority. You may choose to opt out from these e-mails at any time.

If you send e-mail to us, we may keep your message, including your e-mail address. We will not use your message to add your e-mail address to any mailing lists, or disclose it to anyone else, without your explicit permission.
