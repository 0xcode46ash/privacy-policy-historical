# Privacy Policy

WebCT.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate its firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: <http://www.webct.com/>. 

We do not sell registered users' names, addresses, or other information to third parties for any purpose. 

We may use a registered user's IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and administer our Web site. A registered user's IP address may also be used to customize the information to make it more relevant to him or her. 

Our site's registration form requires registered users to give us contact information (e.g., name, email address). We use registered users' contact information to confirm registration, deliver newsletters, and occasionally send information about our company and the Web site. Registered users may opt out of future mailings. Directions on how to opt out will be provided in any email correspondence we send to registered users. 

A registered user may review or request changes to his or her personal information by sending email to the WebCT Web site group at [contact@webct.com](mailto:contact@webct.com). 

This site contains links to other sites. WebCT.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

WebCT.com provides an order form for registered users to request information about WebCT's products and services. Information that is supplied to WebCT.com through these forms will be used to get in touch with the registered user, when necessary, or to deliver orders to a registered user who has purchased something. Financial information (e.g., a credit card) provided by a registered user is used to bill for products and services. The billing is done through a WebCT partner, Cybersource Corporation. Cybersource uses registered users' order information only to process and record purchase transactions. Information provided to Cybersource will not be used for any other purposes and will not be sold to third parties for any purpose. 

WebCT uses cookies to provide convenient automatic login to WebCT.com. Using cookies, an Internet browser can "remember" a registered user's user name and password, so that he or she is logged in and ready to participate. If the registered user selects the "Remember this password..." option when he or she logs in, the registered user won't have to sign in each time he or she comes back. If a registered user is concerned that other people might accidentally use his or her account, or if the registered user uses a shared computer, he or she should not check the box. To ensure that WebCT.com asks for a username and password the next time a registered user visits the site, the user should close his or her browser or click "Log Out" when he or she leaves the computer. Users can always sign off at any time by clicking the "Log Out" link at the top of each page. 

Registered users' profile information may be used to create personalized content, services, and marketing on WebCT.com. WebCT.com discloses aggregated user statistics (e.g., "75% of our users are students") in order to describe services to prospective partners and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. 

**Public Forums**

This site makes chat rooms, forums, and message boards available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and that you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. WebCT reserves the right to remove any posting that its editors consider inappropriate. 

**Security**

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information stored therein. Order information is transmitted through Secure Socket Layer technology throughout the entire purchase process to protect you and allow you to buy with confidence. Credit card information is not stored permanently on this site.

**Material Changes to Privacy Policy**

If WebCT makes material changes to this privacy policy, we will contact all registered users via email, at the email addresses provided upon registration, in advance of the change. 

For questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, please contact:
