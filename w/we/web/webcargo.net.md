By using Webcargo.net after the updated policy has been so posted, you consent and agree, without limitation or qualification, to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information and to the privacy practices set out in the updated Privacy Policy.

**1\. What information of yours does Webcargo.net collect?**

The goal of Webcargo.net is to help you sending your e-document and simplyfied the management of doing it. To achieve this goal, Webcargo.net needs to collect personal information. 

Personal information includes information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name and postal code. Wherever and whenever Webcargo collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page. Webcargo collects personal information in the following ways from different parts of Webcargo.net: 

Personal information is gathered when you voluntarily register with Webcargo.net. If you choose to register you may provide Webcargo with your name, postal code, email address and other information. While not all of this information is required, the more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. If you choose not to provide the requested information, Webcargo.net may not be able to offer you some of the personalized services that depend on this type of information to function. However to register, you still have the option of providing only the minimum necessary information.   
If you contact Webcargo.net, we may keep a record of that correspondence. We do not collect any email addresses of those who communicate with Webcargo.net via email. We use the information provided only so that we may respond to the email. 

**2\. What are "cookies" and "web beacons" and how does Webcargo use them?**

We also collect anonymous information using "cookies." A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a web site to the hard drive of your computer so that the web site may identify you without having to sign in each time. This unique number identifies your browser-- but not you -- to Webcargo.net computers whenever you visit Webcargo.net. A cookie will NOT let a web site know any personal information about you, such as your real name and address. The coding in the cookies Webcargo sets lets us know that you are using a particular computer but nothing more. Since cookies are only text files, they cannot run on your computer, search your computer for other information or transmit any information to anyone. 

To help serve you better Webcargo uses cookies to: 

Help us remember who you are through your browser settings so that Webcargo can offer and provide personalized services. Webcargo uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about what is done and seen across Webcargo.net. Cookies also allow us to save passwords and preferences for you so that you will not have to re-enter them the next time you visit. 

Measure traffic patterns. Without cookies, it could be difficult for Webcargo to know that certain services are more popular than others are. This information helps us to better understand when to offer new services.   
Estimate audience size. Cookies help us know whether or not users have seen particular displays, including advertisements. 

Displaying advertisements. Webcargo and third party advertising networks used by Webcargo may use cookies when serving advertisements. See section 3 below for details on the information gathering practices of our ad serving partners. 

Cookies are used on most major web sites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser either to notify you when you have received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. You should understand that while Webcargo does not require you to use cookies, certain sites will not function properly if you set your browser to not accept cookies. 

Webcargo.net may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow Webcargo to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access your personal information on Webcargo.net; they are a technique used to compile aggregated statistics about Webcargo.net usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. Webcargo.net web pages may also contain Web beacons placed there by our advertising partner to help Webcargo determine the effectiveness of our Internet advertising campaigns. 

**3\. What organization is collecting the information?**

When you provide personal registration information at Webcargo.net , that information is collected by Webcargo. It may be disclosed to other organizations in the circumstances described in Section 5 below. 

The majority of the online banner advertisements you see on Webcargo.net are served through a reputable third party. If you would like to know more about what information is collected and how information is used by our third party ad server or about its "opt-out" procedures, please click here www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy. 

Be aware that Webcargo.net sponsors and other advertisers have links on our sites that take you to other sites that may collect personal information about you.

No personal information will be disclosed to these sponsors and advertisers as part of this process; only information in an anonymous, aggregate form will be disclosed.
