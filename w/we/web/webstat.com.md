Please read the Privacy Policy carefully because it governs how we use the information you submit to us. If this Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not use the information you have submitted to us in a manner that is inconsistent with the Privacy Policy under which the information was originally collected. 

#### How We Use Your Information

Optional information includes a demographic and interest survey. This information is not used in conjunction with your personal information. It is used abstractly in part to help us develop our services to meet the needs of the majority of our users and to deliver relevant advertising content. 

WebSTAT does not collect, store, or use information about children under 13. You must be at least 13 years of age in order to use a WebSTAT account.

#### Cookies

Cookies are used to facilitate page path tracking and statistics on returning/unique visitors. They are not used to collect personally identifiable information about visitors.

Session cookies expire within a short period of time or when you close your web browser. 

With most Internet browsers, you can block all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Blocking all cookies is not advisable because it will decrease your ability to navigate through some sites and generally lower the quality of your Internet experience.
