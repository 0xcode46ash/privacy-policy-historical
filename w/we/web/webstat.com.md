**Privacy Policy & Statement  
**  
**Commitment to Privacy:**  
WebSTAT.Com respects the sensitive nature of the information you provide us. Our Privacy Policy is designed to protect your personal information while maximizing your access to our free services.  This Privacy Policy describes how we treat the information we receive about you when you sign up for an account. Please read the Privacy Policy carefully because it governs how we use the information you submit to us. If this Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not use the information you have submitted to us in a manner that is inconsistent with the Privacy Policy under which the information was originally collected.

**How We Use Your Information:**  
When you sign up for an account on WebSTAT.Com, you provide us with some personal information.  Some of it is optional but most is required.  Personal information includes such things as your name, zip code, time zone, and email address which is used to help identify unique accounts, provide you with web traffic statistics tailored to your website, and to provide a level of accountability for use of our services.  Optional information includes a demographic and interest survey.  This information is not used in conjunction with your personal information.  It is used abstractly in part to help us develop our services to meet the needs of the majority of our users and to deliver relevant advertising content.  WebSTAT does not collect, store, or use information about children under 13. You must be at least 13 years of age in order to use a WebSTAT account. E-mail addresses are utilized only to notify users of significant changes, to address support concerns, or to resolve abuse issues.  WebSTAT.Com does not provide or sell **any** sensitive user information, including e-mail addresses, billing information, street addresses, phone numbers, etc. to any third party without the express permission of the user.  Your e-mail address will ONLY be provided to our trusted third party marketing partners if you "opt-in" (specifically choose) to receive e-mail offers about products and services.  Any email you receive as a result of an "opt-in" request will provide you with the opportunity to "opt-out" of receiving future e-mails.  WebSTAT does not promote, support, or tolerate e-mail spam! 

**Cookies:**  
Cookies are used to facilitate page path tracking and statistics on returning/unique visitors. They are not used to collect personally identifiable information about visitors. WebSTAT.Com uses sessional cookies to help determine whether or not you are logged into your account and to keep your account data secure from unauthorized access. Sessional cookies expire within a short period of time or when you close your web browser. With most Internet browsers, you can block all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Blocking all cookies may not be advisable, however, because it will decrease your ability to navigate through some sites and generally lower the quality of your Internet experience. Likewise, setting your browser to send you a warning that allows you to accept or reject a cookie can be very distracting, given the extent of cookie usage by websites. It is also possible to delete all cookies from your computer's hard drive. Simply search for files with the name "cookie" in them. Many cookies can be deleted with no ill effect, but some will contain information that will make your subsequent visits to certain websites more useful. 

**Advertising & Third Party Partnerships:**  
WebSTAT works with reputable third parties such as MaxOnline (Doubleclick) and ValueClick to serve ads to this site. In the course of delivering an ad to you these companies collect certain non-personally identifiable information about you.
