# Web CEO Privacy Policy

Last Revision: May 17, 2011

Web CEO Corp. (hereinafter "WebCEO") is firmly committed to the privacy of its customers. WebCEO shall take all reasonable measures to have your personal information protected to ensure you feel safe and secure.

This Privacy Policy covers how WebCEO uses personal information that users provide to WebCEO when they use WebCEO Desktop software, WebCEO Online tools, HitLens Traffic Analysis and Site Uptime Monitoring services (together hereinafter “Services”). By using any of the Services you accept the terms of our Privacy Policy.

## **How We Collect and Use Your Information**

You can browse the WebCEO website (hereinafter “Website”) located at http://www.webceo.com without providing any personal information. To start using any of the WebCEO’s services you may be required to register and provide some personal information.

The information that WebCEO collects about you can be classified as Personal Information and Anonymous Information. Personal Information refers to information that identifies you as a person, for example your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, payment details. Anonymous Information refers to information that does not identify a specific individual.

## Personal Information

We collect your email address when you register in the Services. If you (a) upgrade your WebCEO Desktop software license or (b) subscribe to one of the paid service plans in the WebCEO Online tools we collect such information as your name, postal address, phone number, credit card and other billing information.

We may use your Personal Information to respond to an email or other inquiry or request, to help improve the Services, to customize your experience at the Website or to send updates or notices about the Services. We also use your Personal Information to bill you for your WebCEO Desktop software license, WebCEO Online subscriptions and other charges. Billing is performed by a third-party billing service that meets Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards securing your sensitive financial and billing information.

## Anonymous Information

Every time you visit the Website, WebCEO saves your IP address, the name and IP address of a remote host computer, time, status and amount of transferred data, the website from which you entered the Service Website and the product and release data of your web browser in a log file. WebCEO uses the data from this log file in anonymous form without reference to your Personal Information for aggregated demographic and/or geographic statistics. Using the log file, WebCEO can also identify defects in the Services and thus continually improve the quality of the Services.

## Cookies

WebCEO may automatically collect some information through the use of cookies. A cookie is a small data file that is stored on a user's computer to enable the Services to recognize a user that previously used the Services. Cookies are also the cornerstone for any Web analytics solution that tracks interaction between a browser and a website.

WebCEO uses information collected from cookies to track the pages of the Website that our users view, the browsers they use and other information about user activity when visiting the Website.

You can change the settings of your web browser to refuse cookies and to remove them from your computer. However, some features of the Services may not function properly without cookies.

## **How We Share Your Information**

Privacy of our users is very important for WebCEO. We shall not disclose, sell, or rent your Personal Information to any third party for marketing purposes. We shall share your Personal Information with the third parties only if you instruct us to, and only if such information is required to provide you with specific services. We may use a credit card processing company to bill the users for licenses, subscriptions and other fees. These third parties shall not retain, share, or store any Personal Information except to provide these services and are bound by strict confidentiality agreements, which limit their use of such information.

WebCEO may disclose Personal Information to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process received by WebCEO, whether or not a response is required by applicable law.

WebCEO shall not access, modify, or otherwise disclose the statistical information that WebCEO compiles for your websites configured in the HitLens Traffic Analysis service except for the express purpose of generating reports which have been authorized by you or otherwise agreed by you, or unless acting under a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process or (2) troubleshoot any service problems.

WebCEO reserves the right to transfer Personal Information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale of WebCEO or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest.

## **How We Protect Your Information**

WebCEO shall use all and every commercially reasonable physical, managerial and technical safeguard to preserve the integrity and security of your Personal Information. We cannot warrant the security of any information you provide in the Services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we received any information from you, WebCEO shall make all and every commercially reasonable effort to ensure the security of our systems. Please note that this is not a guarantee that unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors that may at any time compromise the security of user information, will not happen.

All traffic analysis reports that WebCEO compiles for your websites configured in the HitLens Traffic Analysis service are confidential. They are strictly connected with your user account and are protected by passwords. You should keep the password confidential and only allow guest access to those whom you trust. WebCEO shall take all measures to protect your traffic analysis reports with advanced security mechanisms (firewalls and SSL encryption).

## **Email Communications**

WebCEO is committed to keeping your email address confidential. We never sell, rent or lease our user email lists or otherwise disclose user email addresses to any third party. We will use our users' email addresses exclusively to communicate WebCEO information to them. We respect your attention and time so we limit the frequency of our mailings to a reasonable amount.

## WebCEO administrative and service announcements

WebCEO may automatically email administrative messages such as 'thank you' messages or welcome messages introducing users to the WebCEO products and services, responses to password recovery, password and email change requests and similar explanatory messages that are necessary for user guidance. Users cannot opt-out from these emails.

WebCEO may email you service announcements such as day and time of expected interruptions of services, change of prices or service specifications. These emails have no opt-out status either.

## WebCEO Site Uptime Monitoring alerts and reports

WebCEO users can subscribe themselves and the third parties involved (a) to the alerts and (b) weekly reports emailed by the Site Uptime Monitoring service. The alert emails cannot be opt-out while users remain subscribed, whereas recipients of the weekly Site Uptime Monitoring reports can unsubscribe using the link at the bottom of a report page.

## WebCEO marketing communications

WebCEO may email marketing messages such as product updates and special offers. However these messages shall be sent only to WebCEO users and never to any third parties. Similarly, the marketing communications are managed from the Subscription Center inside WebCEO Desktop software (Main menu -> Help -> Manage your subscriptions). Upon receipt of the first special offer or product update email message, users can opt out by clicking the Unsubscribe link at the bottom of the message.
