**What information do we collect? How do we use it?**

**Call For Entries:**  
When you submit a site(s), we need to know your name, email address, phone number, mailing address, tax id number, URL, company, title, age, gender, education, credit card number, expiration date and a few details on your Web site's functionality and content. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you if you are nominated as well as to learn more about the demographics of our nominees. 

**The O11 and Press Updates:**  
When you sign up for The 011 or Press Updates we collect only an email address to deliver the requested information. 

**Voting for The People's Voice Awards:**  
When you register to vote for [The People's Voice Awards](http://www.webbyawards.com/peoplesvoice/) we collect an email address and user-created password to establish a unique identifier for each voter. This lets us provide maximum security against "ballot stuffing" and helps us notify voters with information pertaining to The People's Voice Awards. We will also use your email address to send you a reminder email to participate in the Webby Awards the following year if you registered for the People's Voice in the previous year. If you do not wish to receive this reminder, you may email [techsupport@webbyawards.com](mailto:techsupport@webbyawards.com) and ask to be taken off the mailing list. 

**Surveys:**  
We will also request demographic information, such as age, gender and years online, in the Rate and Win survey if you choose to participate . The information collected on the Rate and Win survey completed during either the People's Voice registration or voting process goes directly to NetRaker, a third-party market research company. They use this information to conduct market research and not for any other purpose. When you go to rate a site, you will be asked to provide age, gender, modem speed and years of internet experience. 

**Press Kit:**  
When you order a press kit we collect a name, email address, phone number, mailing address, title, company, assigning media outlet, nature of request and deadline. This enables us to contact you and process your request. 

**Sponsor Information Form:**  
When you submit a request for sponsorship information, we collect a name, email address, phone number, mailing address, title and company. This enables us to contact you and process your request. 

**Webcast Postcards:**  
When you request a postcard to be sent to your friend, we ask you for your name, email address and your friend's name and email address. We do not use this information for any other purpose than to send your friend the postcard. 

**Contests and Promotional Features:**  
When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address, and email address so we can administer the contest and notify winners. In some cases we offer you the opportunity to receive information about new services, special offers and other news that you might find valuable. To receive such notifications you must opt-in to the distribution list. If at any time you choose to opt-out of receiving such notifications you may do so by sending your request to: [techsupport@webbyawards.com](mailto:techsupport@webbyawards.com).

**How does The Webby Awards protect customer information?**

When you place orders or access account information we provide a secure server with secure server software (SSL) with up to 128-bit key length that encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. 

**What about "cookies"?**

[www.webbyawards.com](http://www.webbyawards.com/) uses cookies on this site to conduct the Audi Sweepstakes. A cookie - a small text file placed on a user's hard drive - is generated by a software application on a site's server. This cookie enables the site's server to only show you the Audi Sweepstakes winner the first time you visit the site. We also use temporary session cookies to assign to you and store a SessionID on all secure pages, including in the voting system for The People's Voice Awards to enable you to vote during multiple sessions and to change votes. These cookies allow you to move uninterrupted between areas of our secure site. This SessionID is not personally identifiable to you and this type of cookie does not leave any retrievable information on your hard drive. NetRaker will also place a temporary session cookie on your computer when you complete a survey of a Web site through our "Rate the nominees" functionality. We also collect non-personally identifiable IP addresses and entry-point and search form information to monitor the number of visitors to the site and the usage of our site.

Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser to prevent that. Even without a cookie, you can still use most of the features on our site, but you cannot vote for The People's Voice or enter your site for a Webby Award. 

We use the services of third-party network advertisers, such as AdForce, on our site. Network advertisers are third parties that collect anonymous information about your usage of this and other unrelated Web sites and attempt to show customized advertisements to you based on the profile of your usage of these sites. The information that they collect is based upon the computer or browser that you are using rather than your name or e-mail address. During your visit to our site you may be served a cookie from these advertisers, which allows the collection of anonymous information to help provide you with targeted advertisements. For more information about AdForce, including what information they collect, how it is collected and your choice not to participate in regard to the creation of a user profile about your usage of Web sites, please click here <http://www.adforce.com/home/privacy/PrivacyPolicy.html>.
