Jump to Privacy Policy

To ensure the highest level of online transaction security, Webjet operates its site in encrypted Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), which provides the highest possible level of transaction security.

In addition, Webjet has also taken the following steps for your protection.

For all Webjet bookings, Websure protects you by providing a free insurance policy against misuse of your credit card and for non-delivery of any product or service.

## Arranged By SafeTrade

Our Internet warranty program is an insurance policy we purchase so we can guarantee if your credit card is used fraudulently as a result of purchasing through our site, or your goods are not delivered, you will be protected up to AUD $4000.00 for any one claim.

SafeTrade is only available on Internet sites that meet strict security standards and provide you with the peace of mind knowing that in the unlikely event of fraudulent use of your card or non-delivery of goods, you are protected.

## Webjet Ensures Your Credit Card Information Is Transmitted Over Secure Lines Using Thawte.

Webjet uses a mechanism widely used by the e-commerce communities to transfer sensitive data over the Internet called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

SSL is a protocol that provides communications privacy, authentication and message integrity and prevents eavesdropping, tampering or message forgery by encrypting data. To check when SSL is active, note the following:

1\. Internet Explorer : right click your mouse and select 'properties'. The URL will display for the page you are viewing as 'https' which denotes that the page is secured / SSL is in effect. 2. Netscape : for version 6.0 and above, those pages that are secured will result in the padlock in the bottom right corner of your browser to close. For earlier versions, the padlock may not change, but, you will get a security alert that you are moving into or out of secured pages providing you have configured your settings to notify you accordingly. To configure those settings, do the following: - select "Communicator" at the top of your browser - select "Tools" - select "Security Info" - select "Navigator" then tick the following boxes - "Entering an encrypted site" - "Leaving an encrypted site" Also, ensure you enable SSL versions 2 and 3 on the same screen.

Note, only those pages that require you to insert private information are secured.

To make a Websure claim, [click here](mailto:%20mtyrrell@safetrade.com.au) to email SafeTrade and ensure you indicate your booking date and booking reference number.
