# Web Profits - Privacy Policy

  


## last Updated - July 18, 2006

As part of Web Profits' business practice, we support the protection of people's privacy rights. We are committed to maintaining the highest standard of privacy and security in the way we conduct our business, from both the company and the associate (employee) level. Web Profits and its associates pledge to conduct our business according to the following principles.

**Privacy Practices for Web Profits**

Web Profits recognises that consumers have rights regarding the use and dissemination of information about themselves. Web Profits adheres to the National Privacy Principles and is fully compliant with the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act of 2000 of Australia.

In undertaking developments for our clients, we design and implement based on these privacy considerations. Each site we develop has its own privacy policy that is the responsibility of our clients.

On the Web Profits site we collect information that is used for our marketing and communications activities. The following information pertains to that data:

**Web Profits Site**

On this site we may ask for and collect personally identifiable information in order to provide a customised experience and communicate with you. You are given notice of this request and have the ability to choose the information you wish to share with Web Profits. You will be informed about how Web Profits may use such information, including whether it will be shared with carefully selected third parties. In most cases, the information you provide is added to our database in order for Web Profits to provide personally tailored messages which are delivered online and offline. You will always be offered the choice not to provide personally identifiable information or to have it shared with others.

Please note that Web Profits does not control and will not be responsible for the privacy policies of third party sites, including site not controlled or authorized by Web Profits. Third party site that are accessed through links on our site have separate privacy and data collection practices, and security measures. We have no responsibility or liability for the practices, policies and security measures implemented by third parties on their site. We encourage you to contact them to ask questions about their privacy practices, policies and security measures before disclosing personal information to them.

**Security**

We respect our visitors' privacy. Personally identifiable information can be accessed and updated by the visitor during and after the registration process. Security is provided concerning names, addresses, email addresses and any other personal information that visitors may provide within the subscription and contact portions of our site. Although "guaranteed security" does not exist either on or off the Internet, we safeguard our visitors' personally identifiable information by using industry standard practices.

**Cookies and Invisible Pixels**

A cookie is a very small text file that is sent to a user's browser from a web server and stored on the user's computer hard drive. It assigns the computer a unique identifier. It is essentially the user's identification card when he/she returns to the Web Profits site. Cookies save you time because they help us to provide a customized experience without having to remind us of your preferences each time you return to our web pages. Web Profits cookies cannot damage files, nor can they read information from the hard drive of a computer.

Cookies can help us provide our visitors with a personalized online experience in the following ways:

  * They ensure visitors are provided with the appropriate content
  * They ensure visitors obtain the information requested
  * They help us deliver communications that are relevant and targeted to our visitors' interests



Web Profits cookies do not follow visitors when travelling on the Internet after leaving the Web Profits site. We track the usage of our site in order to modify it according to our visitors' needs. We pay attention to what information is requested and attempt to make it easier to find such information in the future.

If visitors do not want the benefits of these cookies they can set their browser to reject the cookies. Visitors should consult the instructions for their particular browser on how to do this. However, visitors should understand that rejecting cookies might affect their ability to perform certain transactions on our site and our ability to recognise their browser from one visit to the next.

Web Profits also uses invisible pixels, sometimes called web beacons, to count how many people visit certain web pages. Information collected from invisible pixels is used and reported in the aggregate without personally identifiable information. Web Profits may use this information to improve marketing programs and content.

**Access to Individual Profiles**

Within the subscription process we provide a profile section. Filling in this information allows us to understand and provide services to visitors. We respect our visitors' privacy and maintain their profile information on secure servers. Personally identifiable information can be accessed and updated by the visitor with the assistance of a Web Profits representative. Web Profits will not use our visitor's confidential information for purposes which are not disclosed to or authorised by the visitor. Visitors have the opportunity to review the information they provide and update it at any time.

Occasionally, information that a visitor requests to be removed will be retained in certain files in order to properly resolve disputes or to troubleshoot problems. In addition, information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical and legal constraints, including stored "back up" systems. Therefore, visitors should not expect that all of their personally identifiable information will be completely removed from our databases in response to their requests.

Data collected by Web Profits is an asset. It is possible that Web Profits, its subsidiaries, affiliates, joint venture companies, or any combination of the foregoing, could merge with or be acquired by another legal entity. In such event, visitors should expect that Web Profits may share some or all of the data collected from its visitors with such other entity; provided, that such other entity will be notified of the practices which apply to personally identifiable information under Web Profits applicable privacy policy.

**Email**

From time to time, and including during the subscription process Web Profits asks visitors for their email address in order to provide relevant information such as newsletters, replies to requests and other special offers. Email addresses may be joined with other information provided at our website and may also be augmented with other data sources. By providing their email address to us, visitors may receive email. Visitors will always have the ability to accept or decline email communications from Web Profits.

Email communication is sent only to people who have consented to receive email from Web Profits or by our carefully selected third parties. At the time of email capture, Web Profits will advise the visitor that we will use the email address for service and product information, as well as marketing and promotional communications. At any time a visitor may opt-out of receiving email communication by following the directions posted in every email, or by following the directions at Web Profits website or by contacting the Web Profits Systems Administrator to opt out of email communication.

**Sweepstakes and Contests**

Sometimes Web Profits runs sweepstakes and contests. We ask people who participate to give us their contact information (like their email address). If a visitor participates in a sweepstakes or contest, his/her contact information may be used to reach him/her in connection with the sweepstakes or contest, and for other promotional, marketing and business purposes.

All Web Profits sweepstakes/contests entry forms will provide a way for participants to opt-out of any communication from the sweepstake's/contest's manager that is not related to awarding prizes for the sweepstake/contest. Entry forms will further provide contestants with a choice whether to receive email marketing materials from our carefully selected third parties. When a visitor enters a Web Profits sweepstakes/contest, the information the visitor provides is not shared with any third party, unless the visitor agrees to such by checking the opt-in box on the sweepstakes/contest entry form. By accepting the prize, the winner agrees that Web Profits (and those acting under its authority) may use the winner's name, picture/portrait, likeness and/or voice for advertising and other promotional purposes without further consideration, unless prohibited by law.

**Research**

From time to time Web Profits may perform research (online and offline) via surveys. All survey responses are voluntary, and the information collected will only be used for research and reporting purposes, to help Web Profits to better serve its visitors by learning more about their needs. The survey responses may also be used to determine the effectiveness of our site, various types of communications, topical opinion, marketing research, advertising campaigns, and/or promotional activities.

If a visitor participates in a survey, the information given by the visitor will be used along with that of other study participants (for example, Web Profits might report that 50% of a survey's respondents are women). Web Profits may share anonymous individual and aggregate data for research and analysis purposes.

Web Profits may also contact participants through email for other purposes if given permission to do so. For example, if participants indicate in the survey that they wish to join a Web Profits online research panel. When a participant submits a survey, the email address and the response to the "future contact" question described above, are automatically stored in a database that is intentionally separated from the participant's survey responses. Therefore, the participant's email address is not tied back to the survey responses. Web Profits will not share with third parties the personally identifiable information provided by a survey participant in response to survey questions. For all other purposes, only aggregate data that is devoid of all personally identifiable information will be used.

In the course of providing surveys to visitors, a cookie may be placed on their browser in order to control the research process, primarily to stop people from being asked to take the same survey twice - or being allowed to take the same survey twice. In addition, the types of advertising visitors view in emails received or on site during the course of their web surfing, may be connected to the visitor's anonymous survey responses.

Participation in Web Profits surveys is voluntary. Participants who do not wish to receive email communications from Web Profits may opt-out of the receipt of such communication by notifying us in the contact us section provided below.
