Online Privacy Policy

By using the Webassessor.com Web site, you agree to the terms of the ASI Online Privacy Policy, as outlined below. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use this site.

**Collection of Personal Information**  
At times, particularly when you order products, download software, or enter contests from the ASI.com Web site, ASI may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to participate in these programs. If you elect to participate in these programs, however, ASI may require that you provide your contact information, which may include your name, mailing address, e-mail address, and other personal identifying information.

When you submit personal information to ASI, you understand and agree that ASI and its affiliates and trusted vendors may transfer, store, and process your customer profile in any of the countries in which ASI and its affiliates maintain offices, including without limitation the United States.

ASI collects this information in order to record and support your participation in the programs you select. If you order a product, for example, the information is used to register your license and rights, if any, to technical support, upgrade discounts, or other benefits that may be made available to registered users. If you enter a contest, information is collected to qualify the entry and contact you regarding the contest or prize awards. ASI also uses information that you provide as part of our effort to keep you informed about product upgrades, special offers, and other ASI products and services.

ASI recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of this information. If you do not want the information you provide to ASI to be used to inform you of other products and special offers from ASI, and you indicate this preference when you provide the information to ASI, ASI will honor your preference. In addition, ASI may selectively provide certain information to other companies or organizations that have products or services we think may interest you. If you do not want the information you provide to ASI to be shared with other companies, and you indicate this preference when you provide the information to ASI, ASI will honor your preference.

**Use of Cookies**  
When you visit Webassessor.com, you can surf the site anonymously and access important information about ASI products without revealing your identity. In order to improve the ASI.com site, we may use "cookies" to track your visit. A cookie is small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a Web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your identification card, recording your passwords, purchases, and preferences. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. (For some Web pages that require an authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept cookies will probably not be able to access those pages.)

While ASI uses cookies to track your visit to Webassessor.com, and our Web servers automatically log the IP/Internet address of your computer, this information does not identify you personally and you remain anonymous unless you have otherwise provided ASI with personal information.

**Updating Your Personal Information**
