# Make Your Privacy Policy GDPR Compliant - Website Planet

If you are like me, you may have noticed privacy and cookie policies popping up all over the internet. Where they used to be hidden way at the bottom of a website’s page, now they are front and center and in your face. Read on to find out why this is the case, what GDPR is, and how to make your website’s privacy policy GDPR compliant. The end of the article includes a sample privacy policy that you are free to use.

## What is GDPR?

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a set of laws that was created to protect the personal data of European Union (EU) citizens. The Council of the European Union, European Parliament, and European Commission joined forces to help people have better control over their personal data.

Officially approved by European Parliament in 2016, the EU allowed a two-year grace period for companies and organizations to comply with the new regulations. Therefore, as of May 25, 2018, any business not complying with the new GDPR laws will be breaking the law.

## Who Is Affected by the GDPR?

Any business operating within the EU and any company that does business, or hopes to do business, with citizens of the European Union must comply with the new laws. Even companies outside the EU are affected if they offer goods or services to citizens of the EU, and anyone who holds personal data of EU citizens can be penalized as of May 25, 2018.

## What Sort of Data Falls under the GDPR?

Any information classified as personal details that can be used to identify a citizen of the EU is protected by the GDPR and includes, but is not exclusive to, the following data:

  * Name
  * Photo
  * Email address
  * Social media posts
  * Personal medical information
  * IP addresses
  * Bank details



Minors cannot legally grant consent to use their personal data; therefore, parents or guardians of children ages 16 and under must be asked for permission before a company can use the minor’s data.

## Why Should Companies Comply with the GDPR?

Any business that does not comply with the GDPR by May 25 will be subjected to steep fines by the EU to the tune of up to 4% or 20 million Euro of global revenue, whichever is highest. And there are more penalties where that came from, depending on the infraction.

Perhaps more importantly, companies that do not conform to the new laws will face the loss of credibility in the marketplace. In other words, complying with the laws of GDPR helps instill confidence in the company’s customers and visitors to its website. Once people feel safe, they are more willing to do business with the organization. Complying with GDPR is not just the law – it is good business.

## What Happens If There Is a Data Breach?

If there is a data breach, which is when an outsider gains access to an individual’s data without permission, the GDPR requires companies to notify the appropriate data protection authorities within 72 hours. The company must also inform the affected individuals as quickly as possible. It is important to note that the GDPR’s main goal is to protect users’ private information.

## What Will the New Privacy Policies Look Like?

Now that you understand the reasoning for the laws and some of the basics of the laws themselves, here are some guidelines for how to write your privacy policy in a GDPR-compliant way:

  1.  **Make sure the policy is short and concise.** The privacy policy must have three basic elements: it must be concise and easily accessible; it must be written clearly in plain language that even a child could understand; and it must be free of charge.
  2.  **Explain your use of the data.** Describe what you are going to do with the data once you collect it. For example, state whether you will use it for marketing purposes or to sell to third parties.
  3.  **Explain your use of cookies.** If you use cookies for online behavioral advertising, which tracks visitors’ interests and online habits, you will need to let your website visitors know.
  4.  **Be transparent about sharing data with third parties.** Clearly state with whom you will be sharing data you collect and for what purpose. While it is within the law to share information about individuals with auditors, social networks, and customer service vendors, to name a few, it is unlawful not to inform your website visitors.
  5.  **Explain the rights of the individual.** You are required to explain what privacy rights your visitors have. Their rights include the following:


  * They can request that their data be deleted or corrected
  * They can access the data a company has about them
  * They can request that their data be transferred to another party
  * They must give consent for their data to be used
