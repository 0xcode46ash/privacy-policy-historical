### The types of information we collect

Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with the best and most useful content and services.

### Pixel Tags

Exelixis Media P.C., its third party service providers and advertisers may use single-pixel gif images, sometimes referred to as pixel tags, web bugs or web beacons, to count Web page accesses and gather some general statistical information. We may use pixel tags to improve our understanding of site traffic, visitor behavior, and response to promotional campaigns, as a supplement to our server logs and other methods of traffic and response measurement. Pixel tags are sometimes used in conjunction with small Javascript-based applications, also for the purpose of traffic measurement. Exelixis Media P.C. does not gather personal information through the use of these images. Our advertisers and third party providers may use single-pixel gifs that can track personal information from cookies that may have been previously placed on a user’s computer. You can disable pixel tags by changing your browser settings to omit images and disable Javascript; or there are commercial software packages available that can omit pixel tags and most advertisements.
