[](https://www.truste.org/validate/43) The At Home Corporation is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. The At Home Corporation owns and operates the Excite@Home Network (and the following [Internet domains](https://web.archive.org/web/20000619154012id_/http%3A//www.webcrawler.com/Help/domain.html)). This statement discloses the privacy practices for the WebCrawler Web Site, and, in fact, also applies to each of the Web Sites of the Excite@Home Network. When you visit a Web site displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, you can expect to be notified of: 

  1. What personally identifiable information of yours is collected
  2. What organization is collecting the information
  3. How the information is used
  4. With whom the information may be shared
  5. What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information
  6. What kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under the company's control
  7. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information

**Our Commitments to You**

WebCrawler wants to make your experience online satisfying and safe. Our data collection policies allow you to choose how much information to provide to us and to control how we use whatever information you tell us. Our goal is to provide you with a robust experience while allowing you to control your privacy and giving you a means to voice any questions or concerns you may have.

Information is collected from you primarily to make it easier and more rewarding for you to use our services. Depending on the service you are accessing, you could be asked at various times to provide information such as your name, email address or information about what you like and do not like. On other occasions when we provide items for purchase online, we may request your credit card number to conclude the transaction or your mailing address to ensure proper delivery. We request this information to provide our strongest value to you – a personalized online experience. Customer's who personalize our service come back more often – and it's the customers that visit us often who make us successful – so we do everything we can to make WebCrawler your service with your name all over it and give you just the content you need.

Information collected online is often defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable: 

  1. **Anonymous Information:** Refers to information that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For instance, we may know that ten thousand people visit this Privacy Policy today, but we do not necessarily know their names, where they live or their date of birth – they are "anonymous" to us, much like how your hometown's bus service knows how many people take a given route – but don't necessarily know who those people are. Many of the individuals who access our services use none of the personalization features which are available to them and are therefore anonymous to us.
  2.  **Personally Identifiable Information:** Refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are such as your name, email address, or postal address. With this information, WebCrawler can provide a variety of personalized and enhanced services that are not available to anonymous users. Examples would be the award-winning "My WebCrawler Start Page," which uses your mailing address to customize TV schedules, weather reports and sports scores; our commerce-enabled services which use this same address information to allow our partners to ship to you the products that you buy; or our free Excite Mail email service which uses your name as part of a security mechanism to protect you from having others read messages addressed to you. We hope that, like many of our customers, you will find it beneficial to provide individually identifiable information about yourself to us because it will make our services more valuable to you. 

The choice of how much of your personally identifiable information that you choose to disclose to WebCrawler is left completely up to you. The only way we know something about you personally is if you register for a personalized service or enter one of our sweepstakes at one of the [Excite@Home Network Internet sites](https://web.archive.org/web/20000619154012id_/http%3A//www.webcrawler.com/Help/domain.html).

**Our Commitments to Your Family**

Like you, we at WebCrawler have children of our own and are concerned about their safety when they use the Internet. We want you and your family to be safe while visiting our Internet sites. That is why we have established the following guidelines for the way we interact with children when they access our services.

Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent. As a TRUSTe Premier Sponsor, we will place a "Children's Seal" on any page that requests information directly targeted to children under 13 informing them that parental consent is needed and we will use a secure method for confirmation of such consent.

Additionally, WebCrawler offers additional levels of protection for minors beyond that which is required by law. While WebCrawler will not target registration to those under 13 without using the safeguards listed above, we recognize that some minors will utilize the registration products associated with our general release products. If a customer does register with us and their birth date indicates that they are not just under 13 but are in fact any age less than 18, we will:

  1. Never knowingly send a copy of a mass emailing to them, regardless of their stated preference given at registration
  2. Never voluntarily share their customer information with any third-party, regardless of their stated preference given at registration
  3. Never list them in any Member Directory in a manner in which their age can be easily identified

The only exceptions to the above policies regarding data distribution collected from minors will be for bona fide non-profit organizations that offer outreach and support to children. In cases where minors have volunteered information in the context of a cobranded peer counseling or mentoring environment on an Excite@Home Network domain, this information will be shared with that cobranded non-profit organization.

In summary, for those who register on our site who are under 18, we'll do everything we can to make sure that their information won't leave our company for commercial use and someone using our site won't be easily able to look up their age. These protections are a start, but there are some actions that we cannot control and in these areas we need help from the child's parent or guardian as well. For instance, we can't stop a minor from giving their age in our unmoderated online chat sessions – but you can counsel them against taking actions like this. For more information about protecting the privacy and safety of minors online, we recommend you visit the [Parents and Children](http://www.truste.org/users/users_privacy_links.html#parents) portion of the TRUSTe site which contains information and links to other resources on this subject.  
  
**What personally identifiable information of yours is collected**

So that we can provide personalization and opportunities for prizes and services, we may at times ask you to submit information such as your name, email address, or to share with us your interests and hobbies. You never have to answer these questions and you can decline this exchange of information on any site at any time. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of such information such as a personalized stock portfolio, a sweepstakes entry, or the purchase and shipment of products and prizes to people who visit our network our service.

To enable many of the features available within the Excite@Home Network, we will assign to your Internet browser (such as Netscape Navigator™ or Microsoft Internet Explorer™) a unique identification number stored in a file on your computer called a "cookie." Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. This unique identification number automatically identifies your browser – but not you – to our computers whenever you interact on one of our Internet domains. When you visit our site, a cookie in effect says to our server computers "Hello, I'm browser #655. What do you do just for me?" Only when you agree to provide information to our services directly, such as through registration, will we be able to know anything about you other than the random number that our server computers assign to your browser in the first place. 

There is much confusion about cookies, how they are used, and what they can do. Cookies are very small text files written by an Internet server to a customer's browser when information is exchanged. Cookies only contain information that the server computer "knew" in the first place and can only be read by the serving domain that placed them. For instance, Yahoo!™ utilizes cookies but WebCrawler's servers can't read their contents nor can Yahoo!'s servers read ours. Cookies are an essential part of how the Internet works today and allow server computers to recognize your computer's browser when you return. If you have ever gone to a web page that automatically provides personalized content to you without you having to "log in," such as your own stock portfolio, this is almost certainly being accomplished with a cookie. As cookies are only text files, they cannot "run" on your computer and have no ability to search your computer for other information or transmit it to anyone.

Cookies are implemented as part of the technology implemented by your web browser. But don't just take our word for it – read what the companies who wrote the browsers have to say!

**How the information is used**

Our network has been designed to enable personalized services for those people who choose to use them. Many of those services that are provided for free through the Excite@Home Network are the result of advertising revenues. Our ability to provide enhanced services and content is dependent on our ability to provide targeted advertising for our partners and clients. Below is a description of how our visitors and advertisers benefit from our use of subscriber information: 

  1. We provide personalized content in the form of news, horoscopes, advertisements, weather reports, stock portfolios, movies, and television listings to our members.
  2. We monitor the actions of the users of our site to determine what our customers want and do not want.
  3. We provide advertisements that support our customers' specific requests for information through keyword searches and editorial content. Do a search on "cars," for instance, and you'll usually see a banner advertisement from an automobile company.
  4. We develop summary – but not individual – reports for our advertisers. An example of a summary report might be "12,000 people clicked on Advertisement 'X' today and of those people, 35% had previously indicated they had an interest in sports." The people that make it possible for you to use WebCrawler for free – our advertisers – need this information to determine how effective their advertising investments are. We never tell our advertisers who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements unless you have specifically told us this is acceptable.
  5. Through our DeliverE email service, we will send registrants of the Excite@Home Network email communications on information we think they will find useful, including information about new products and services from our selected partners. It is our policy to never send messages to members who have asked us not to do so, either at initial registration or later through an unsubscribe process. In every email from any company or Web Site of the Excite@Home Network, we will remind you of your option to change your preferences regarding receipt of email communications. Additional information is provided in the What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information section below.

  
---  
Other companies which place advertising on our site may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising or content through the use of cookies (using the same techniques as described above). Due to the way the Internet technically operates, we cannot control this collection of information. You should contact these advertisers or content providers directly if you have any questions about their use of the information they collect.

Information that you provide while using products such as Excite Message Boards and Excite Chat is available for all to see – discretion should be used in entering personally identifiable information within such forums as it may be collected by third-parties – this is a leading source of unwanted email, for instance. The Excite@Home Network does not associate with customer records any information entered by its customers in our Excite Mail, Excite Message Boards, or Excite Chat products.

And finally, the Excite@Home Network does not control the information collection and distribution policies on Internet domains other than those [Internet domains](https://web.archive.org/web/20000619154012id_/http%3A//www.webcrawler.com/Help/domain.html) that are part of the Excite@Home Network itself. We do, however, encourage our co-branding partners to adopt privacy policies similar to this one and to become licensees of TRUSTe, something which we have been relatively successful to date achieving: Look for the TRUSTe logo wherever you go on the Internet!
