**What information is Web Marketing Today gathering about its visitors and how is it being used?**

Every computer connected to the Internet is provided with a domain name (e.g. earthlink.net) and an IP address (e.g. 192.168.1.100). When a visitor requests a page from within the Web Marketing Today website, our web servers automatically identify and log the HTTP request that is made to them, as follows:

  * The IP address of the site that may have referred you.
  * Your IP address.
  * The web page from which you linked to us.
  * The product identifier for version and make of browser (e.g. Internet Explorer 7.0).
  * The operating system that you are running (e.g. Mac OS, Windows, Linux).
  * Search words or terms that are passed from a search engine (e.g. Google, Yahoo, or Lycos).



There is nothing unusual about the information just described, and the practice of collecting this data has been generally standardized by many web servers.

The purpose of this information is actually two-fold. One, Web Marketing Today has found it advantageous to examine visitor traffic in its aggregate so that we can ensure maximum compatibility for the various browsers and operating systems that visit our site.
