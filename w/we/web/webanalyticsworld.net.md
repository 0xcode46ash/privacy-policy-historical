If you are a registered user of our website and have supplied your email address, we may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback and keep you up to date with what’s going on. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
