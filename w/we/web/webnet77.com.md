# Webnet77 - Privacy Policy

_**Domain Registration  
**_  
When you sign up for a website we naturally require certain information about you like your name, address and email address. This information is used for the Registrant information when we register your domain name with a Domain name Registrar. By law, all domain names must be registered in the name of an individual and this information is usually accessible to the general public. 

_**Webnet77's use of your personal information**_

We keep your information on record only insofar as it enables us to contact you by email (or by post if necessary) for purposes of billing and accounting. We will never give out your personal information to a third party without your consent unless required to do so by a law enforcement agency.
