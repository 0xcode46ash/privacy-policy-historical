# Web Analytics Demystified Privacy Policy | Web Analytics Consulting from Web Analytics Demystified

At Web Analytics Demystified your data privacy is our primary concern. Because we do collect some personally identifiable information on this site, this document describes how that information is used and not used.

We do collect email addresses in exchange for downloadable documents, but we never sell or share those email addresses with anyone. We do, from time to time, send email to folks who have shared their email addresses in order to make you aware of some special offer or event that Web Analytics Demystified is participating in.

We also collect email addresses from those of you who wish to participate in Web Analytics Wednesday events around the world. Those addresses are shared with the event host, and with the host's discretion, the event's sponsor. There is, however, a check box that indicates "It is okay to contact me about Web Analytics Wednesday" and if you **un-check** that box we will make every effort to not contact you other than to confirm your participation in Web Analytics Wednesday.

We also collect email address and other information such as Twitter usernames and site URLs from people participating in The Analysis Exchange. That information, by necessity, is made available to other members of Analysis Exchange and at this time we do not have any way for "anonymous participation." Members of the Analysis Exchange are manually approved by Web Analytics Demystified staff and anyone caught abusing this information will be promptly removed from the program.

We use third-party web beacons from Yahoo, as well as first-party beacons from Google Analytics and Omniture Insights to help analyze where visitors go and what they do while visiting our website. Yahoo and Google may also use anonymous information about your visits to this and other websites in order to improve its products and services and provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. You can obtain more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by [Yahoo](https://ondemand.indextools.com/optout,OptOut.vm?domain=stats.indextools.com) and [Google](http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacypolicy.html#information) from their respective web sites. Of course, you can opt-out of cookie-based tracking at any time by simply clearing your browser's cookie cache.

We also are using a service called [beencounter](http://www.beencounter.com/) that allows us to scan your document object model programatically looking for specific sites you may have visited in the past. Our use of this product is in strict compliance with their privacy policay and you can read [their privacy policy](http://www.beencounter.com/?page=privacy) at the beencounter web site.

At any time you can unsubscribe from our email rolls by simply emailing eric at webanalyticsdemystified.com and asking to have your address removed.

Please address any other questions about this policy [to us directly.](mailto:feedback@webanalyticsdemystified.com)
