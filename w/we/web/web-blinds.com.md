### What information do we collect and how do we use it?

We collect information when you place an order, request free samples and save a quote – but **we only keep it with your permission**.

  * We ask for your email address and phone number to process and deliver your order and to give you a more personal shopping experience.
  * You don’t have to give us your name, address, telephone and payment details unless you place an order.
  * We may use your details to tell you about goods and services we think you’ll be interested in from us and the Hillarys group of companies we’re part of – but **we always give you the option to tell us if you don’t want your information to be used in this way**. 
  * If you want us to **stop sending you information** , just email us at [enquiries@web-blinds.com](mailto:enquiries@web-blinds.com)
  * We sometimes link to sites not owned by us that we think might interest you. We’re not responsible for privacy or security on these sites.



We use a secure server that encrypts the information you give us. We do not store your card details and all numbers are encrypted when we process your order 

All our staff who have access to your personal data take respecting your confidentiality very seriously.
