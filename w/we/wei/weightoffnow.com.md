**Privacy Policy**  
We are committed to safeguarding your privacy as you use this web site or order products/materials.

All information collected through this site will be kept confidential. It will not be sold, rented, traded, loaned, or otherwise disclosed to any other party unless we receive your explicit consent.

This site may contain links to other sites at which personal information may be collected. In such instances, unless expressly provided to the contrary, the collection and use of your personal information will be governed by the privacy policy applicable to that site.

Any personal information you provide will be used only in ways that you have consented to. If you contact us to place an order, we will use your information to fulfill your order and contact you about the order. This information may be shared with third parties, but only for purposes of order fulfillment, such as credit card processing or shipping information.

When ordering products or services on this site, you may be asked to provide a credit card number. Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.

We may use your personal information to contact you for promotional purposes, such as with informational e-mail messages. In any such case, we will provide a clear means for you to remove yourself from future mailings.

Information that is not personally identifiable may be collected and stored for site statistics and research to make our web site more usable. This may include information such as site visitors' browser and operating system, IP address, domain and host names, and date and time of access. This information is not shared with any third parties except in the preparation of statistical or research reports from our logs.

 **Site Security**  
When you use secure online forms on our web site, information that you provide is protected with SSL encryption as it is transmitted to our servers. The information is then stored securely offline.

We maintain our web site and associated data with technical, physical, and administrative safeguards to protect against loss of data or unauthorized access to or use of data. However, as with any Internet technology, no data can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

 **Use of cookies**  
When you visit this site, you can browse and access important information without revealing your identity. In order to improve our site, we use "cookies" to track your visit. A cookie is a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a Web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. (For some Web pages that require an authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept cookies will probably not be able to access those pages.)

While we use cookies to track your visit, and our Web servers automatically log the IP/Internet address of your computer, we do not use this information to identify you personally.

**Questions**  
If you have questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy, you may contact us at 866-393-7041 or simply  [ email us](mailto:msjtroy@earthlink.net?subject=%22Questions%20on%20Privacy%20Policy%20-%20WeightOffNow.com%22), and we will be glad to assist you.
