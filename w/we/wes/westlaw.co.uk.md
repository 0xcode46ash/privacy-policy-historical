Registered Office and address for service: 100 Avenue Road, London NW3 3PF), which trades using various trading names, of which a list is posted on its website at [www.sweetandmaxwell.co.uk/about/index.shtmx](http://www.sweetandmaxwell.co.uk/about/index.shtmx), and is part of Thomson Reuters. 
  2. Thomson Reuters (Legal) Limited ('the Company') is committed to respecting your privacy and we recognise your need to know that your personal information is being lawfully processed and held in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. The Company is a registered data controller under number Z7602050. 
  3. This Privacy Statement has been created in compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998 data protection principles and is designed to help you understand how we may use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us via any of the Company's websites. 
  4. Company websites may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. This Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected by us via Company websites. This Privacy Statement also applies to any information you may provide directly to our customer service teams. That information may include any personal contact information and other information we may need to provide assistance and information to you. 
  5. In general you may browse Company websites (other than those provided on a subscription basis) without providing any personal information. The information we collect on an aggregate basis, as you and others browse Company websites, is not used to identify you in any way. If you want to interact with us via a Company website or if you wish to register to use certain parts of a Company website, we may ask you to provide us with some personal information. 
  6. You may be asked to provide us with details about yourself so that we can provide you with information or services you have requested or send you information about our products and services.

    * cookies only contain as much information as was disclosed to the site that sent it 
    * cookies do not take information from your hard drive, delete files or contain viruses 
    * cookies are small files (100s of bytes) and do not pose a disk space problem 
    * the information in each cookie cannot be readily decoded or used in any other way 
    * if you choose you can usually change your web browser to disable storage of cookies.
