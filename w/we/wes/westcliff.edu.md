# Privacy Statement - Westcliff University

__ Commitment to Privacy 

This policy addresses the use of Personal Information collected, used, processed and disseminated by Westcliff University.

Westcliff University (Westcliff) is committed to maintaining the privacy and security of any collected confidential or highly sensitive Personal Information from students, faculty, staff, alumni and others (aka data subjects) who share information with Westcliff.

__ Lawful Basis for Collecting and/or Processing Personal Data 

Westcliff has a lawful basis to collect and process personal data. Most of the university’s collection and processing of personal data falls under the following categories:

  * Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which Westcliff is subject
  * Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into an agreement
  * Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Westcliff
  * The data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes



__ Security via Encryption 

Westcliff maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of the information under its control. Safeguards include restricted access to computer systems and paper files, firewalls, encryption (for electronic safeguards) and secure authentication methods.

For example: when either: a) the university’s online admission application; or b) form for payments asks a data subject to enter personally identifiable information for online transactions, that electronic/digital information is protected using Secure Sockets Layer protocol (SSL encryption). Any information supplied by the data subject is encrypted when it is sent from the subject’s browser to the university’s server. To learn more about SSL encryption, visit the Verisign Resource Center: <https://www.verisign.com/en_US/security-services/resource-center/index.xhtml>

Likewise, when student performance information is evaluated in either the university’s Student Information System (SIS) or the Global Academic Portal (GAP), the information is encrypted by SSL protocols.

__ Data Protection and Integrity 

Westcliff protects all personal data and sensitive personal data that it collects or processes for a lawful basis. Any personal data and sensitive personal data collected or processed by Westcliff are:

  * Processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner
  * Collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes, and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes
  * Limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are collected and processed
  * Accurate and kept up to date
  * Retained only as necessary
  * Secure



All collection, storage, and maintenance of centrally-managed institutional data are appropriately managed and maintained by centrally-administered institutional systems and processes.

__ Data Authorization and Access 

Access to institutional data in its many forms is vital to the successful operation of the university. Faculty, staff, students and authorized university parties need appropriate access to university data in support of legitimate university business functions. Likewise, all users authorized to access institutional data are obligated to appropriately use and effectively protect institutional data. Authorization is granted based on the classification of university data to be accessed, the individual’s roles and responsibilities, and need-to-know.

University data are categorized as follows:

  * Public: Information that is currently released or approved to be released to the public without restriction by the appropriate information owner. Information in this classification does not need protection from unauthorized access or disclosure; however, Westcliff makes every attempt to protect the integrity and availability of such


  * Internal: Information that is intended for official Westcliff business purposes only. It is not appropriate for information in this classification to be made available to the general


  * Confidential: Information that is specifically protected by law, contracts, third-party agreements, or for other university business reasons as established by the appropriate information owner.


  * Regulated: Information that is specifically protected by international, federal, state, local, or industry policies and/or laws and regulations, for which strict protection, use and handling requirements are Access may be granted to this classification of information by the appropriate information owner to only authorized personnel with a legitimate need-to-know.



As an institution of higher education, Westcliff collects, stores, and processes sensitive data in conducting its day-to-day business operations and is therefore subject to various information security and privacy laws that regulate the access, use, and handling of that information. The following includes, but is not limited to, specific laws and regulations that are included in this classification:

  * European Union General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) ([https://gdpr-info.eu](https://gdpr-info.eu/))
  * S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Red Flag Rule (Identity theft regulation)
  * S. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
  * Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)
  * California Senate Bill 1177, Privacy: Students. BPC Code, Division 8, Chapter 22.2, Section 22584
