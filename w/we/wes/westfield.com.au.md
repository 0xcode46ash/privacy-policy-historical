# Privacy Policy

## Customers

When entering competitions at Westfield's centres, customers provide us with their contact details. Westfield collects these details to contact competition winners, and to inform customers about upcoming Westfield events, activities and promotions.

On the competition entry form, customers are given the opportunity to indicate that they do not wish to receive any such further promotional material from Westfield.

##   
Retailers

Westfield collects the following types of personal information from unincorporated retailers and guarantors during negotiations for, and during the term of, the lease/licence:

  * contact and insurance details;
  * ABNs;
  * information as to retailers' financial standing and retailing experience; and
  * other financial and trading information,



  
Westfield deals with that information in accordance with the National Privacy Principles.

Westfield requires this personal information to evaluate whether the relevant centre owner should enter into a lease or licence with the retailer; to assist Westfield in the management of their relationship; and to monitor the performance of the centre. Occasionally, the information may also be made available to others in connection with any transactions involving the ownership of the centre.

If the retailer provides Westfield with direct debit details, Westfield will only disclose those details to Westfield's bank to facilitate the provision of that service.

##   
Shareholders and unitholders

Westfield maintains shareholder and unitholder registries through an external service provider, currently Computershare Investor Services Pty Limited. Westfield requires Computershare __ to comply with the National Privacy Principles when performing these services.

Personal information collected from unitholders and shareholders includes: contact, bank account and unit/share holding details; and tax file numbers.

This information is used to carry out registry functions such as payment of dividends or distributions, sending annual and half yearly reports, notices of meetings or newsletters, and notifications to the ATO. In addition, contact information will be used from time to time to inform shareholders and unitholders of new initiatives concerning Westfield.
