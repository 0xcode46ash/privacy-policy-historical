 **Changes to Credit Card Conditions of Use - How payments will be applied**

As part of our mission to simplify our products and services, from 11 June 2019 we’re changing how payments are applied to your credit card account.

Any payments you make will first go to charges and interest accrued, then to cash advances and purchases, followed by balance transfers. 

If you have a balance transfer on your credit card, this change means any balance transfer amount won’t start being paid off until any cash advances or purchases made on your card have been paid in full. Previously, payments went towards your balance transfer before cash advances and purchases.

See the Application of Payments section in the Conditions of Use applicable to your credit card below, effective from 11 June 2019.

We’ve also made some minor wording changes to the Conditions of Use, to ensure our definitions are as clear as possible.

If you need more information you can always come in to any branch for a chat or contact us on **0800 888 111**.

 ** **14 March 2019****

From 28 March 2019 we’re making the following changes to our term sheets for each of Westpac Term PIE Fund, Westpac Term Deposits and the Westpac Notice Saver PIE Fund. To see the full changes please see our updated Term Sheets below.

 **Westpac Term Deposit**

If an early withdrawal is approved by us, in addition to providing us with at least 32 days’ notice, a reduced rate of interest will apply. The calculation that is used to calculate the reduced rate of interest is changing.

Currently the reduced rate of interest is calculated by taking the lesser of:

A) the original agreed interest rate, less **3% per annum** or

B) the interest rate on offer at the time the investment was made for the actual term run through to the date of early withdrawal or a similar term (as we determine in our sole discretion), **less 3% per annum**

The new Term Sheet for Westpac Term Deposits will increase the amount payable on approved term deposit early withdrawals by replacing the references to “less **3% per annum** ” with “less **2% per annum** ”.

Further, the Westpac Term Deposits Term Sheet is changing to clarify that, in the event we agree to an early withdrawal, customers may still cancel the early withdrawal or reduce such early withdrawal amount, prior to the early withdrawal date.

 **Westpac Term PIE Fund**

If an early withdrawal is approved by us, in addition to providing us with at least 32 days’ notice, a reduced rate of return will apply. The calculation that is used to calculate the reduced rate of return is changing.

Currently the reduced rate of return is calculated by taking the lesser of:

A) the original agreed rate of return, less **3% per annum** or

B) the rate of return on offer at the time the investment was made for the actual term run through to the date of early withdrawal or a similar term (as we determine in our sole discretion), less **3% per annum**

The new Term Sheet for Westpac Term PIE Fund will increase the amount payable on approved early withdrawals by replacing the references to “less **3% per annum** ” with “less **2% per annum** ”.

Further, the Westpac Term PIE Fund Term Sheet is changing to clarify that, in the event we agree to an early withdrawal, customers may still cancel the early withdrawal or reduce such early withdrawal amount, prior to the early withdrawal date.

The Term Sheet has also been updated to clarify that customers must provide their IRD number when opening a new Westpac Term PIE Fund account.

 **Westpac Notice Saver PIE Fund**

Approval of an early withdrawal request under the Westpac Notice Saver PIE Fund will only be considered if we agree you are suffering financial hardship.  In this case, no reduction to your return will apply.

For this reason the “Return reduction for early withdrawals” section of the Westpac Notice Saver PIE Fund Term Sheet is being removed from the Westpac Notice Saver PIE Fund Term Sheet.

Please refer to the updated **[Westpac Term PIE Fund Term Sheet](https://www.westpac.co.nz/assets/Uploads/72783JN-13-03-19-Term-PIE-Fund-Term-Sheet.pdf)** , **[Westpac Term Deposit Term Sheet ](https://www.westpac.co.nz/assets/Uploads/72157JN-12-03-19-Term-Deposit-Term-Sheet.pdf)**or the **[Westpac Notice Saver PIE Fund Term Sheet](https://www.westpac.co.nz/assets/Uploads/72934JN-7-03-19-Notice-Saver-PIE-Term-Sheet.pdf)** for more information.

 **4 February 2019**

From 18 February, we’re making the following updates to our General Terms and Conditions.

  * Removing specific references to our Contact Centre opening hours, and instead publishing them on our website.
  * Changing the Contact Centre phone number from 0800 400 600 to 0800 WESTPAC – however both numbers will still work.
  * Removing the wording that advises you that you can delete your mobile phone number in Westpac One. You are only able to edit the mobile number.
  * Removing the words “you can alter, amend, delete a direct debit in Westpac One” – unfortunately this function cannot be performed in Westpac One and can only be carried out by contacting the business that the direct debit was arranged with.



**21 September 2018**

We’re updating our General Terms and Conditions.

We’re continuing our process of simplifying our products and services to make them easier for you to use.

From Monday 8 October 2018 we’re making a change to our General Terms and Conditions. This change explains the process around when we would be able to move you onto a new account.

If there is a reason to move you, we will always contact you in advance to explain why and outline the details of the product or service we have selected for you. You will then have the opportunity to discuss this change and other options with us, prior to any move taking place.

The reasons we may move you are when:

  * a product or service is no longer available, or
  * you are no longer eligible for a product or service, or
  * you’re current product might be adversely affecting you



We are also updating the Electronic Banking Terms to better reflect our current electronic banking functionality.

 **Want to know more?**

Visit the updated [**General Terms and Conditions**](https://www.westpac.co.nz/assets/Who-we-are/About-Westpac-NZ/Westpac-General-Terms-and-Conditions.pdf) now before they come into effect.

 **14 September 2018**

As part of our ongoing process to simplify our products and making them easier to use, we are making some new improvements.

From 28 September 2018, we are changing the name of the Notice Saver PIE account to Notice Saver and making some changes to the terms and conditions that apply to the Westpac Notice Saver PIE Fund (“Fund”). These are set out in the Westpac Notice Saver PIE Fund Term Sheet.

The key changes to the Term Sheet are:

  1. Customers will be able to make withdrawals from their Fund account to any New Zealand bank account.

  2. When customers submit a withdrawal notice, they will no longer receive a lower rate of return on the withdrawal amount.

  3. In some instances we may not be able to meet the aim to offer returns that are higher than that for a term deposit. The term sheet has been amended to reflect this.

  4. There will no longer be a minimum investment amount. However, if a customer’s account balance is $0 (being 0 units), they will not have an interest in the Fund.

  5. When opening an account, the customer and any joint investor must notify us of their IRD number.




Please refer to the updated [Westpac Notice Saver PIE Fund Term Sheet](https://www.westpac.co.nz/assets/Personal/Investment-and-KiwiSaver/Term-Sheets/Westpac-Notice-Saver-PIE-Fund-Term-Sheet.pdf) for further information.

Changes to the Electronic account, renamed the Westpac Everyday account

  * The monthly account maintenance fee of $3.50 – currently waived for customers who choose to receive statements electronically – will be removed.
  * If you choose to receive paperstatements you’ll now be charged a $1.50 paperstatement fee instead of the current monthly account maintenance fee. Receiving your statements electronically will continue to be free.
  * The manual transaction fee of $3.00 per transaction – which covered manual deposits and manual withdrawals – will be replaced by a manual withdrawal fee of $2.50 per transaction. Manual withdrawals include cheques written and withdrawals over the counter. Manual deposits will be free. The manual withdrawal fee is capped at a maximum of $5.00 per month, per account.
  * Anyone 65 years or older will now be eligible for a fee exemption on their Westpac Everyday accounts, which means they won’t pay the paper statement fee or manual withdrawal fee.*

 **22 December 2017**

From 8 January 2018, we’re making the following changes to our term sheets for each of Westpac Term Deposits, the Westpac Term PIE Fund, the Westpac Cash PIE Fund and the Westpac Notice Saver PIE Fund.

1\. In the term sheets for all four products, some references to the Code of Banking Practice are being replaced with a reference to Westpac General Terms and Conditions.
