Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Westfield may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Westfield affiliates, agents or service providers.

It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.

In operating the Services, we along with our third party partners may use tracking technologies such as, without limitation, Cookies, E-Tags, JavaScript, Local Storage Objects (LSOs) HTML5 and Flash, and web beacons.

In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. You may opt out of such tracking by clicking  **[here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/)**.
