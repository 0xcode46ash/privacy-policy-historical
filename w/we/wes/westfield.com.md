This Privacy Notice explains Westfield’s privacy and information practices for its website, mobile applications (together, “Online Services”), and centers. This Notice describes the types of information collected, how that information is used and disclosed, and how you can access, modify, or delete your information.

**INFORMATION COLLECTED**

We collect information from you when you use our Online Services or visit Westfield centers.

**ONLINE SERVICES.** When using our Online Services, you may provide information directly, such as by creating an account, filling out a form, signing up for SmartParking, completing a “contact us” query, applying for a career with Westfield, or signing up for newsletters or other communications. Additionally, you may choose to provide your location when using a Westfield Online Service.

We may also collect information from you automatically when you use our Online Services. For instance, we may collect information about your use of our Online Services, including the time and duration of your visit, the referring URL, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the type of device you use and its operating system, your advertising ID (e.g., AAID and IDFA), and other device identifiers.

**Cookies and similar technologies.** Westfield and its partners use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies when you use our Online Services. For more information, including how to manage your cookie preferences, see our [Cookie Policy](https://www.westfield.com/cookies).

**IN OUR CENTERS.** We use Bluetooth (BLE) Beacons, Wi-Fi, and similar technologies within some of our centers that may communicate with your (mobile) device and identify its location if the device has Bluetooth and/or Wi-Fi enabled and is properly configured. As a result, we may collect your Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth MAC Address and send BLE signals to your device. To opt out of BLE Beacons and/or the collection of your MAC address, turn off your device Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capabilities.

For more information you may also visit <https://smart-places.org/>.

We may also collect information about your use of the Wi-Fi, such as the web pages you visit, your MAC or IP address, and your location while using the Wi-Fi.

**Concierge Services.** If you use our concierge services in center or online, we may collect information from you to facilitate the products or services you request. Concierge services vary by location--check with the concierge in your local center to see what services are available and what personal information is required to use those services.

**THIRD-PARTY SOURCES.** Westfield may obtain information about you from third parties and/or link the information we collect from you to additional records made available by third parties.

**HOW INFORMATION IS USED**

Westfield uses the information it collects for three primary purposes: 1) to operate our business, including providing and improving our products and services; 2) to send you communications; and 3) to tailor and show advertisements to you.

**Providing Westfield products and services.** We use the information we collect to perform essential business operations, for example to understand usage patterns (such as foot traffic) within our centers, and to develop, provide, improve, and personalize Westfield products and services and to provide customer support.

**Communications.** We use information we collect to deliver and personalize communications through various channels, including email, SMS messaging, push notifications, and other channels where you have consented to receiving communications from Westfield. See the “Choice” section on how to change your communications preferences.

**Advertising.** Westfield uses the information you provide us to help us tailor and show advertisements to you. We may partner with third parties to help us display relevant advertising and to manage our advertising across multiple channels. Our third-party partners may use cookies and non-cookie based technologies in order to help us show you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.

You may opt out of some interest-based cookie advertising by clicking “Cookie Settings” in the footer below.

**SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION**

**Service Providers.** We may share information we collect about you with third parties who provide services on our behalf to help with our business activities (e.g., payment processing, data storage).

We may also share your information with service providers that help us market our products or services to you and to tailor and deliver advertisements to you.

**Disclosure for Legal Reasons.** We may disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or comply with the law, including valid legal requests from private parties, law enforcement, or other government agencies (e.g., subpoena, summons, or court order).

**Change of Ownership.** If Westfield is involved in a merger, acquisition, dissolution, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, we reserve the right to transfer your personal information. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership and choices you may have regarding your personal information.

**YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES**

We enable you to maintain control of your privacy by providing choices about what information you provide us and how we communicate with you, and by providing access to your personal information.

You may adjust your communication preferences or opt out of communications at any time by clicking “unsubscribe” at the bottom of the email, following instructions provided in the communication, or changing your preferences within your Westfield account. If you are having difficulty updating your communication preferences, [contact us](mailto:unsubscribe@westfield.com).

**Access.** You may access, correct, or delete your personal information by logging into your Westfield account and following the relevant prompts, or by [contacting us](mailto:unsubscribe@westfield.com).
