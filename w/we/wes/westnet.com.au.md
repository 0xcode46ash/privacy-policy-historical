# Westnet - Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy

Westnet takes its responsibility to protect your personal and financial information.   


Westnet operates under strict privacy guidelines outlined by the Federal Governments Privacy Act (see [www.privacy.gov.au](http://www.privacy.gov.au/)) 

In order to conduct business there is certain information that Westnet requires from members such as your name, date of birth, address, telephone numbers, payment details along with any survey responses or information supplied for competitions you choose to enter.

**Use of Personal Information**

There are two primary reasons Westnet requires such information. 

  1. To supply services to our members:  

• including market research and product development purposes;  
• also general administrative purposes involving customer service records and connection logs. 
  2. To enable us to communicate with members:   

• To identify members when they contact Westnet;  
• for billing-related reasons including debt collection;  
• to inform members of any changes/ improvements/ additions to our service offerings. 


**Protection of personal information**

Westnet collects and stores information in electronic and/or hardcopy formats. Stringent measures are taken, in accordance with Government legislation, to guarantee that all information provided is kept confidential and secure. Provisions are in place to ensure that members ' accounts are only viewable by those personnel within the organisation that have the appropriate security clearance.

**Disclosure of Personal Information**

Under no circumstances will Westnet sell members' information. The only time information is disclosed to a third party is when it is integral to the provision of services or if Westnet is required to do so by law. In both cases these entities meet with strict guidelines to preserve members ' privacy. Our third party suppliers will not contact Westnet members unless expressly requested to do so by the member themselves.

**Members Access to their Account Details**

Members are able to view and update their account information at any time online through the [My Account](http://myaccount.westnet.com.au/) section of the website.

**Cookies**

Saving of passwords, and pre-population of information is made possible by cookies. Cookies are simply small text files that are automatically saved on your computer when you visit or interact with a website.  
For our members' convenience, Westnet uses cookies. These pieces of information are applied to our site to enhance its functionality to save you having to input the same information time and time again.  
Westnet does not use cookies to store personal information about you or to track your internet usage.

**Changes to Privacy Policy**

Westnet is committed to enhancing our members experience through enhancements to existing services and investment in new technologies. As such we will update our Privacy Policy as necessary. Any changes to our privacy policy will be communicated to members via email or in our monthly [Westnet newsletter](http://www.westnet.com.au/members/newsletter/) and will be viewable on this page.
