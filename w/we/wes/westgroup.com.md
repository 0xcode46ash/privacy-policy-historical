**What Information Do We Collect?**

**Browsing**  
When you browse westgroup.com, you do so anonymously. West Group does not collect personally identifying information about you.

To improve our site and make it more useful and interesting to you, we use "cookies" for navigation of our online stores and for customization of information that we may present to you. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change this feature in your browser.

**Ordering Online**  
If you decide to purchase a product online, we will collect only the information necessary for authentication and billing purposes. When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, delivery address, credit card number and expiration date, or West Group account number. This allows us to process and fulfill your orders and to notify you of your order status.

If you decide to enter a contest, participate in an online survey or use one of our other promotional features, such as a free trial for a particular product, we may ask for your name, address, e-mail address and other pertinent information to administer the contest and tabulate survey results.

**How Is Data Secured?**  
Personal information is handled with the same quality of care as all other West Group transactions to ensure the integrity and security of your personal information. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) server software to prevent unauthorized access to the information you submit when you order items from the online store. When you place orders or access your account information, SSL encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. You can identify the secure connection by looking at the URL, which will begin with https: (instead of http:).

**How Do We Use the Information We Collect?**  
West Group uses the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. West Group does not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others.

West Group may provide summary statistics about our customers' interests and preferences, products sold, traffic patterns and related site information to a reputable third party. These statistics do not include personally identifiable information; they are used only to enhance the design of our Web site and customize new product offerings to our customers.

West Group does not use or share personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described in this policy.

**How Is International Information Handled?**  
Personal data, which you have voluntarily entered, is delivered electronically to West Group servers located in the United States. By using these forms, you consent to the transfer of this data and to West Group's use of such data as outlined in this policy.

By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by West Group. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose this information.
