If you purchase by credit card, this information may be forwarded to your credit card provider.

For other types of registrations, we will ask for your name, address, email address or telephone number. We may then contact you with information about other products and services.

Finally, you may be asked to disclose personal information to us so that we can provide assistance and information to you. For example, we may collect personal information from you (such as an email address, system information and problem descriptions) in order to provide online technical support and troubleshooting.

  * As required by law, in a matter of public safety or policy, as needed in connection with the transfer of our business assets (for example, if we are acquired by another company or if we are liquidated during bankruptcy proceedings), or if we believe in good faith that sharing the data is necessary to protect our rights or property.
