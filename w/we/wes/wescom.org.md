Web Site Privacy Policy**

Wescom Credit Union is a member-owned financial cooperative.  You joined the Credit Union with the expectation that we act in your best interest and make available the financial products and services that enable you to meet your financial goals.  Trust is at the foundation of our relationship with you, and protecting your personal information is as important as safeguarding your money.  To preserve that trust and ensure that you can rely on the quality of products and services we provide, we have formulated the following Privacy Policy: 

1)     We will ask you only for the personal information we need to conduct business with you and administer our products and services; 

2)     We will protect your personal information. The Credit Union will maintain strong security controls to ensure that personal information in our files and computers is protected.  Where appropriate, we will use security encoding techniques to protect against unauthorized access to personal records, ensure accuracy and integrity of data, and protect your confidentiality; 

  
3)     We will not sell, share, give, or otherwise provide your personal information to any non-affiliated third party for marketing.  We have partners (for example, Autoland, CFS eVision) who provide valuable services that the Credit Union does not offer. We hold these partners to strict confidentiality standards, and prohibit them giving your information to any party other than Wescom. We will share information only when necessary to administer the products and services we provide (for example, with credit bureaus), or when required to do so by the state and federal government.  In accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, we report to the three national credit bureaus. 

  
4)     We deliver information to mailing houses or similar neutral parties in order to mail Wescom statements, Wescom promotional materials, Wescom surveys to members and other similar material, but with the strictest confidentiality requirements. We may use outside companies to conduct surveys of our membership. 

  
5)     You may elect not to receive marketing and advertising materials from Wescom.  You may make this request in person, by telephone, by e-mail, or by writing to us.  We will take all reasonable steps to make sure your requests are followed. 

  
6)     We will remind you at least once a year of your right to choose not to receive promotional materials from us.

### Internet Privacy Policy

1)     We will ask for your e-mail address when you enroll in eBranch in order to contact you with important information about your account, and, from time to time, to send you information about our services.  The account number and password that you provide on the eBranch login screen is collected to verify your identity and protect your account information.

2)     We may use your Internet address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Web site, and to compile general statistics. 

3)     We make limited use of cookies on eBranch to ensure that you’re seeing only your information; cookies expire immediately after you close your browser or log off the site;

4)     We may use data about your usage of our Web site to send you promotional information. 

5)     We have partners who provide you with valuable services online that we do not offer (for example, eVision Online Trading, Autoland Car Buying). They may collect information through their Web sites in order to administer services you have requested, and may share this information with Wescom.  We hold our partners to strict confidentiality standards, and prohibit them from giving your information to any party other than Wescom;
