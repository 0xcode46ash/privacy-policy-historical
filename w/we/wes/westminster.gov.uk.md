# Westminster City Council - Web Site Privacy Policy

Westminster City Council will endeavour to safeguard the privacy of its website visitors. This document explains the website data processing practice.

##### What information do we collect?

We will collect personal details appropriate to the service you require. In some areas, this may simply mean registering your name, address and email details. Other on-line forms will require more information.

##### What do we use personal information for?

There are various reasons that we need to collect personal data. For example, we may need your contact details for correspondence purposes. Similarly, we may need information because of legal requirements. Subject to your agreement, we may contact you to let you know about new online services, or get your feedback on how we're performing. In any event, we will only ever ask for information that is absolutely necessary and does not constitute an invasion of privacy.

##### Allowing your details to be used across other council services

We're in the process of transforming our services in line with the Council's One City Vision. This is part of our commitment to improve the quality of people's experience when they contact us.

We all get frustrated on occasion when we have to repeat the same basic information over and over again. Because of this, we're focussing on making it easy for people to do business with us, whenever and however they choose, all through a single contact, which should remember the relevant information.

By allowing your details to be used across other council services, you are allowing us to re-use information to minimise the time taken when you contact us in the future.

##### Rights

Please note that in agreeing to share these details you have not forfeited your rights as prescribed under the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Council will continue to apply the same level of care to safeguard your privacy as we always have done. Your service entitlement from the Council will not be affected should you decide not to allow your data to be shared in this way. For more information about how we process personal data please see our [Fair Processing Notice](https://web.archive.org/services/councilgovernmentanddemocracy/dataprotectionandfreedomofinformation/fairprocessing).

##### Email Messages

We are keen to ensure that we are providing our citizens with services that they need. Consequently, you may receive occasional e-mail messages from Westminster City Council on matters that we consider may be of interest to you, if you have provided your email address to us for this purpose.
