# Wesabe: Privacy Policy

This website is owned and operated by Wesabe, Inc. We have written this policy in order to describe the privacy practices that apply to our web services worldwide, and to explain how we may collect, use, and share information associated with these services.

Please take a few minutes to review this policy. If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, please contact us at [support@wesabe.com](mailto:support@wesabe.com).

The effective date of this policy is: December 4, 2009.

### Your options

  * **You are in control:** We believe strongly that you should be in control of what happens to your data. We try to offer you choices when we ask for personal information, whenever reasonably possible, and we have created tools that allow you to control the amount of personally identifiable information shared with others.
  * **User access:** We make a good faith effort to provide you with the ability to correct your personal information at your request. We may, however, be forced to decline requests that are unreasonable, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, are otherwise impractical, or where the information is required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purporses.
  * **Opt-out:** If you choose, you may decline to provide personal information to us and/or refuse cookies in your browser, although some of our features or services may not function properly as a result. In such cases, we would appreciate an email saying what you don’t like about our privacy practices, and what we can do to improve.
  * **Deleting your account:** Because we believe that your data is yours, and that you should be able to control it, we also allow you to delete your private data from our servers at any time. Please note that, while some data may be preserved on backups for up to 180 days after it is deleted from our production servers, it will not generally be possible to recover data that is accidentally deleted. Please be careful!



### The Information We Collect

  * **Required account information:** The only information Wesabe requires in order to create an account is a username and a valid email address. All other information is completely voluntary. Usernames are used only to identify accounts, and are never shared with anyone. We recommend the use of anonymous email accounts for users who want to increase their anonymity.
  * **Optional account information:** When creating an account, you may also choose to enter a public name, zip or postal code, and other information about yourself. Entering this information is entirely up to you: while it allows us to provide improved and personalized service, we respect the wishes of those who may wish to remain anonymous.
  * **Private information:** Some features of Wesabe’s systems allow you to submit private information, including financial statements, transaction details, and access credentials to third-party sites. This information is kept in the strictest confidence, and never shared with anyone without your consent.
  * **Aggregate information:** Wesabe may combine the anonymous private information of many users together to form aggregate data such as average spending at particular merchants and spending patterns over time. This aggregate information does not identify particular users or otherwise allow anyone to recover sensitive information about individual users. Aggregate information belongs to Wesabe, and is not subject to this privacy policy.
  * **Publicly posted information:** Wesabe offers a number of ways for you to communicate with other users, including the Tips, Groups, and Wesabe Mail systems. Please keep in mind that information posted on these systems may be public and accessible to others. You should exercise caution when deciding to post personal information in such forums.
  * **Technical information:** Wesabe servers may record various pieces of technical information, such as IP addresses, browser versions and capabilities, or referring site addresses, whenever you visit one of our sites. Wesabe sites may also store information, known as cookies, in your browser. These pieces of technical information are used to make the site more secure and easier to use, to monitor and troubleshoot performance and reliability issues, and to judge the effectiveness of individual features and marketing campaigns. This technical information is not directly correlated with the personal information of individual users.
  * **Information about children:** We do not and will not knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. Any person who provides their personal information to Wesabe through this website represents that they are 13 years of age or older. (This is consistent with the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.)
  * **Other websites:** This privacy policy applies to websites and services that are owned and operated by Wesabe, Inc. We do not have any control over the websites of third parties that may be linked to from pages on our website, and we cannot be responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. We encourage you to check the applicable privacy policy of these sites before entering information on them.



### How We Use Your Information

  * **Customized content:** We may use personal information to provide the services you’ve requested, including services that display customized content.
  * **Decision support:** We may use aggregate and non-personally identifiable data to provide the broader Wesabe community with information to make better decisions.
  * **Keeping in touch:** We may use your personal information to contact you under various circumstances, such as in response to support requests, or to deliver newsletters or alerts that you have requested. You may opt out of any or all of these communications if you so choose.
  * **Third parties:** We may share non-personally identifiable aggregate data with third parties outside of Wesabe. We may also share personal information with third parties in limited circumstances, including when complying with legal process, preventing fraud or imminent harm, and ensuring the security of our network and services. When we use third parties to assist us in processing your personal information, we require that they strictly comply with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. 



### How We Protect Your Information

  * **Privacy wall:** The data that you submit to Wesabe is divided into two categories: public and private. Public data is associated with your public persona (i.e., publicly posted information and some forms of optional account information such as public name and user image). Your private data, which includes your bank account and transaction information, is only connected to your public persona by your password, which we never store. Therefore, your private data can only be connected to your user account when you are logged in; when you log out of Wesabe, the connection is completely severed and your privacy protected.
  * **Anonymization and encryption:** Where feasible, the data that you send to Wesabe is scrubbed of sensitive information (such as account numbers) before processing. When we must store and process sensitive data in order to provide the service, we make extensive efforts to protect that information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. These steps include the use of firewalls, network-layer encryption such as SSL, storage-layer encryption, and dedicated monitoring systems.
  * **No guarantee:** No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.
  * **Notification:** If Wesabe learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using this website or providing personal information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of this website. Wesabe may post a notice on our website if a security breach occurs. Wesabe may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at [support@wesabe.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20100531000752id_/http%3A//www.wesabe.com/page/support@wesabe.com). 



### International Visitors and Customers

  * **Safe Harbor:** This website is hosted in the United States. If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that the United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a set of data protection principles (the "Safe Harbor Principles") to enable U.S. Companies to satisfy the requirement under European Union law that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from the EU to the United States. Wesabe’s privacy policy conforms to these principles, in keeping with our commitment to protecting your privacy.



### Changes and Updates

  * **Updates to this policy:** We may occasionally update this policy. When we do, we will also revise the effective date of the policy. If any change to this policy would be significantly less restrictive, we will attempt to obtain your consent before implementing the change.
  * **Change of control:** If Wesabe is ever sold, merges with another entity, or files for bankruptcy, the information covered by this policy will be considered a Wesabe asset and may be transferred. If any such change of control would result in significantly weaker protections for your data, you will be given the opportunity to opt out of such a transfer.
  * **Your consent:** Your continued use of this website constitutes your agreement to this privacy policy and any updates.



### Contacting Us

  * **Questions?** If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about Wesabe or this Privacy Policy, please don't hesitate to contact us. In the event that we are unable to resolve your concerns, Wesabe is committed to to achieving a proper resolution of your privacy concerns through transparent and cooperative measures.
