### PRIVACY POLICY – ONLINE SUPPLEMENT

This section describes Westlake’s practices regarding information we receive about you during visits to this web site. The amount and type of information we receive depends on how you use this site.

### Normal Web Site Usage

You can visit our web site to read product, investment, and company information, or use our on-line tools without revealing any personal information. The only information we collect and store during normal web site usage is the name of your Internet service provider, the web site you last visited, the pages you request, the date and time of those requests and the number of visits you made to our website.

We use this information to generate statistics and measure website activity in order to improve the usefulness of customer visits to our website. This same information may be shared with third parties in order to provide these services or to analyze, store, or aggregate the information. It may also be shared with other third parties, working with us to improve the services of Westlake or our website. During normal web site usage, we do not collect or store personally identifiable information such as name, mailing address, email address, phone number, or Social Security number.

### On-Line Collection of Personally Identifiable Information

Occasionally, Westlake will request personally identifiable information in order to provide the web site visitor with a service or correspondence (e.g., promotions and mailed brochures), or access to services like the MyAccount portal. This information, such as name, mailing address, email address, type of request, and possibly additional information, is collected and stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of the request as determined by Westlake and is used to fulfill your request. Whenever we request such information, we will clearly explain how it will be used. If you tell us that the information should not be used as a basis for further contact, we will respect your request. The information you provide is used by Westlake to improve the services we provide you. This information may also be provided to agencies for use on behalf of Westlake in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

**Electronic Mail Sent to Us That Contains Personal Information**  
Internet users may decide to send Westlake personally identifying information, for example, in an electronic mail message containing information about your Westlake account. Westlake will only use this information to identify the user as a Westlake customer and to determine how to respond to the electronic mail. We will use this information for the purpose identified in the email message and to enhance our understanding of you in order to improve our services to you.

### Westlake’s Internet Services

To use Westlake’s Internet services, such as MyAccount access or Electronic Funds Transfer or Enrollment, we require a certain amount of personally identifying information (e.g., name, Social Security number, account number and other applicable information) we can use to verify you as a Westlake customer. We use this to identify and access data in the existing relationship we have with you in order to provide you with the requested services. We request email addresses as an alternate means of contacting you. Providing your email address is optional, except when you request an Internet delivered service, then it is necessary for us to have your email address in order to honor your request. We may also use this information to enhance our understanding of you and improve our services.

### What Are Cookies?

A “cookie” is a small line of text that is stored within your browser when you visit a cookie-enabled website. As you browse the Web, cookie-enabled sites will send cookies to your browser, along with pages. Your browser probably has options that will let you control whether the browser accepts cookies, rejects cookies, or notifies you each time a cookie is sent to you.

If your browser is set to reject cookies, cookie-enabled websites will not recognize you when you return. This provides you with anonymity, but it also makes it very difficult to offer you customized services. It is also less secure than using cookies, because all of your specific data must be sent to the website each time you view a page. Accepting cookies means your private data can stay at the Web server, and the only information transmitted over the Internet is your ID cookie.

If your browser is set to accept cookies, any cookies that are sent to your browser are stored in your computer for a period of time. There are a few different types of cookies. A “session” cookie is stored only in your computer’s working memory (RAM) and only lasts for your browsing session. When you close all of your browser’s windows, or when you shut down your computer, the session cookie disappears forever. A “permanent” cookie is stored on your computer’s hard drive until a specified date, which could be tomorrow, next week, or 10 years from now. Permanent cookies stay on your computer until either a) they expire, b) they are overwritten with newer cookies, c) you manually remove them.

We use permanent cookies to supply visitors to our site with a customized experience. These cookies do not involve personally identifiable information. We also use session cookies to customize your experience during a session, to aid in your navigation and use of the site, to develop generic web site metrics and other similar uses.

### Questions?

Our privacy practices are designed to provide a high level of protection for your personal information and our systems. If you have any questions or comments about Westlake’s privacy practices, you can contact us via email at [WestlakeCustomerCare@westlakefinancial.com](mailto:WestlakeCustomerCare@westlakefinancial.com) or by phone at 888-739-9192.

### Changes

We reserve the right to change, modify, or adjust our Privacy Policy as needed. A revised Privacy Policy only applies to data collected subsequent to its effective date. Any revisions will be posted at least 10 days prior to its effective date.
