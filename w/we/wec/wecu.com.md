                                 WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Why?                             Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law
                                 gives consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us
                                 to tell you how we collect, share, and protect your personal information. Please read this
                                 notice carefully to understand Whatcom Educational Credit Union’s Privacy Policy.
What?                             The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the accounts or
                                  services you have with us. This information can include:
                                         Social Security number and income
                                         account balances and payment history
                                         credit history and credit scores
                                 When you are no longer our member, we will not share your information except as
                                 permitted or required by law as described in this notice.
