# The Weekly Standard Privacy Policy

_THE WEEKLY STANDARD_ PRIVACY POLICY

_The Weekly Standard_ is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of Privacy Principles applicable to all its U.S.-based companies. _The Weekly Standard_ has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information ("PII") we obtain from and about individuals located in the U.S.

From time to time _The Weekly Standard_ may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, technology or industry initiatives.

_**COLLECTION:** COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ("PII") BY _THE WEEKLY STANDARD__

_General._ _The Weekly Standard_ collects personally identifiable information ("PII" -- that is, information such as your full name, email address, mailing address or telephone number) when you voluntarily submit the information to us in order to subscribe to _The Weekly Standard_ or our online newsletter, to participate in activities like surveys, polls, forums, chats or bulletin boards, to register for activities on our web site, or because you want us to furnish you with products, services or information. On those occasions when we obtain PII from a third party, we use only reputable sources of such information.

_Cookies._ Cookies are small bits of information that the Internet site operated by _The Weekly Standard_ places on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on our site and enable _The Weekly Standard_ to make your visits to our site more enjoyable. For example, cookies can store your password for easy logon to our site on a subsequent visit or can save your preferences for a personalized home page. The cookie itself does not contain PII.

Third party advertisements displayed on the Internet site operated by _The Weekly Standard_ may also contain cookies. _The Weekly Standard_ does not control these advertiser cookies and visitors to our web site should check the privacy policy of the advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies.

You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely.

_NOTICE:_ _THE WEEKLY STANDARD_ WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES

When _The Weekly Standard_ collects PII from you, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses _The Weekly Standard_ will make of the information.

This Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send you information about their products and services and therefore may want to share your personal information (See "Use" below). However, _The Weekly Standard_ will notify you of your options regarding our use of your personally identifiable information, including whether we can share it with outside companies (See "Choice" below).

Sometimes we collect personally identifiable information from consumers in manual format, such as a post card or subscription form. Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical. However, the post card or form will direct consumers to _The Weekly Standard_ web site where this Privacy Policy is posted. In addition, each edition of _The Weekly Standard_ provides information about where and how to access this Policy.

_The Weekly Standard_ 's web site may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. _The Weekly Standard_ 's web site also carries advertisements from other companies as well as advertisements placed by national Internet ad agencies. Although we choose our business partners and advertisers carefully, _The Weekly Standard_ is not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our site or for the privacy practices of third party or so-called national advertisers. Once you've left a _The Weekly Standard_ site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you.

_The Weekly Standard_ 's web site may also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with _The Weekly Standard_. Visitors to those affiliated sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Policy.

_**CHOICE:** _THE WEEKLY STANDARD_ WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII_

_The Weekly Standard_ will provide you with the opportunity to choose whether your PII may be used for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted. You will also be able to instruct us not to share your PII with companies that are not affiliated with _The Weekly Standard_ (i.e., not part of the News America Group).

_**USE:** _THE WEEKLY STANDARD_ 'S USE OF PII_

_The Weekly Standard_ will use your PII in a manner that is consistent with this Policy and only for the purpose for which it is submitted, unless other uses are disclosed at the time of collection and you allow us to use your information in these other ways.

_The Weekly Standard_ may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with usâ€”i.e., those that are among the News America Group of companies. _The Weekly Standard_ may also share your PII with companies that are not affiliated with _The Weekly Standard_ , but would like to send you information about their products and services. For example, our subscriber list may be shared with other publications you might be interested in receiving. If you do not want your name included on lists shared with third parties, please write us a note indicating your desire in this matter and enclose the mailing label from one of the issues you have received as a subscriber. Send your letter to Customer Service, _The Weekly Standard_ , 1150 17th St. N.W., Suite 505, Washington, D.C., 20036.

_The Weekly Standard_ employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your PII. Outside contractors or agents who help us to fulfill your subscription to our magazine or to manage other activities that involve the collection of PII may only use PII to provide _The Weekly Standard_ with a specific service and not for any other purpose.

If _The Weekly Standard_ obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of this information is governed by this Policy.

_The Weekly Standard_ may be required to disclose PII to comply with legal requirements, such as a court order, and to protect the safety and security of visitors to our web sites.

_**SECURITY:** _THE WEEKLY STANDARD_ PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII_

_The Weekly Standard_ uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. In addition, _The Weekly Standard_ uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete.

_**ACCESS:** HOW TO ACCESS, CORRECT OR DELETE YOUR PII_

If you want to review the PII _The Weekly Standard_ has collected from you, change or correct your PII or stop all future subscriptions or communications from _The Weekly Standard_ , please click on Customer Services or write Customer Service, _The Weekly Standard_. 1150 17th S. N.W., Suite 505, Washington, D.C., 20036.
