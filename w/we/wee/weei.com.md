# ETM Privacy Policy

Your personal privacy is a principal concern to us at Entercom Communications.   Our goal in outlining our policy on the collection and use of listener/customer data is to ensure the highest level of confidentiality and security.   When you provide your personal information to any Entercom radio station, we will not give or sell your personal information to any outside company for its use in marketing or solicitation.  We will maintain the confidentiality of your personal information and it will be used only to support your customer relationship with our radio stations, assisting us in providing better and more targeted services to you.    Additionally, internal practices are in place to help protect your privacy by limiting employee access to and use of customer data.  When Entercom asks for customer/listener information, it is done with the goal of improving the relationship between an Entercom radio station and the listener.  At Entercom, we allow our listeners to maintain control over their personal data while attempting to provide a more interactive online experience. Our intention is to send e-mail only to listeners/customers who have chosen to receive such e-mails. At any time, you have the right to decline receiving future communications in any manner, including email, fax, telephone and postal mail. 

 

  


## Privacy Policies

·        **Information Collection**

When you **browse** any Entercom radio station Web site, you do so anonymously. Personal information -- including your e-mail address -- is _not_ automatically collected. Some of our Web sites, however, may request that you **voluntarily** supply us with personal information, including your E-mail address for purposes of participating in correspondence, site registration, streaming player registration, membership, making a purchase, contests or online surveys. For these types of activities we may require your name, e-mail address, gender, zipcode and birthdate.  Other optional information may be asked (listener/customer preference information, mailing address, telephone numbers, lifestyle interests, and other demographic information) that is needed to register or subscribe you to services or offers. 

Like many other commercial Web sites, some Entercom web sites may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how our site is used.  Please read **About Cookies** below for more information. 

·         **We collect only information that is needed.** We limit the collection of information about our listeners/customers to what we need to know to manage their membership, to provide customer service, to offer new products and services, and to fulfill any legal and regulatory requirements. 

·         **We give listeners/customers choices about how their data will be used.** On a regular basis, we provide our listeners/customers the ability to decline any or all future email communications. __

·         **We give listeners/customers access to their data online.** __ A listener/customer may change, update or add additional information about themselves at any time through our radio stations’ web sites, which offer this feature. If a station does not currently provide this ability, listeners/customers can still change their data profile by contacting the local station.  All Entercom radio stations will provide this feature in the near future. __

·         **We use information security safeguards.** We attempt to limit acccess to listener/customer data to those who specifically need it to conduct their business within the company. While we use security techniques designed to protect our listener/customer data, given constantly changing technologies that may exist, we do not guarantee the security of our listener/customer data. 

·        **We hold employees responsible for our privacy principles.** Each Entercom employee is personally responsible for maintaining listener and customer confidentiality. Employees who violate these policies are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. Employees are expected to report violations -- and may do so confidentially -- to their managers or other supervisors

·         **We anonymously track visitor usage of our sites for general marketing purposes, such as determining what information is of most and least interest to visitors, and for other purposes such as determining the site's technical design specifications and identifying system performance or problem areas.** We track this activity utilizing an out-sourced product, WebTrends Live, from WebTrends Corporationã. As such, we present the following information on behalf of WebTrends Corporationã to address your privacy concerns specific to this area: ****

**Privacy Statement for Visitors to Sites Tracked by WebTrends Live**

WebTrends does not collect individual profile information for visitors across multiple sites and does not aggregate information from any other sources about browsing patterns of individual visitors across multiple sites. 

**Principle 4 - Use of Anonymous IP Address**  
IP addresses are recorded by every site on the internet. WebTrends collects this information as well, but does so exclusively for the following uses: (1) anonymous statistical purposes; or (2) administration of our web site and servers, and to improve our services. 

**Principle 5 - Anonymous Use of Cookies**
