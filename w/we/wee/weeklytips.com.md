# Privacy policy - weeklytips.com

Welcome to weeklytips.com's privacy policy. We at  weeklytips.com view the protection of individual privacy as critically important, and we are committed to maintaining the highest standards in the industry.  weeklytips.com's proprietary technology allows us to deliver relevant, targeted content to individuals, but not at the expense of individual privacy. It is our fundamental goal at  weeklytips.com to remain the industry leader in internet-enabled marketing and advertising, while maintaining our commitment to these standards.

**_COMPANY PRACTICES_**

The following statement describes the overall company practices of weeklytips.com, including advertising on our network of websites, as well as across other internal sites, and products and services that are offered by weeklytips.com ([Multiple Stream Marketing](http://www.multiplestreammktg.com/)).

**INFORMATION COLLECTED BY weeklytips.com**

**_Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Data_**

weeklytips.com delivers advertisements across multiple channels and media, including to web surfers who visit any of the web sites that are a part of weeklytips.com's network. With respect to individuals who visit those sites, we collect what is known as "Opt-In Data." Opt-In Data is not anonymous, and customers have to choose to join weeklytips.com database. 

In addition to the opt-In data, we also advertise with several search engine companies for opt-in members.

**SHARING WITH THIRD-PARTIES**

All personally-identifiable data provided by individuals is maintained in strict confidence by weeklytips.com and will be treated with the same level of respect and care that weeklytips.com treats its other proprietary information and trade secrets. There are instances, however, in which personally-identifiable and non-personally identifiable information is shared with third-parties.

weeklytips.com may also share personally-identifiable information with third-parties who enter into business relationships with us. These business partners may include companies that perform marketing services on our behalf, and others such as non-profit organizations. We may also disclose information to a third-party who provides substantially similar services as the original service signed up for, if we decide to stop providing such services ourselves. In such situations, we will provide our subscribers with an opportunity to opt-out of such sharing. Please be aware that weeklytips.com is very careful about which companies it does business with.

Finally, weeklytips.com may share information on individuals as it deems necessary to comply and cooperate with government and law enforcement officials.
