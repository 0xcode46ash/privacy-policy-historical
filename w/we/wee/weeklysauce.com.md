**WeeklySauce®‘s special note to parents**

In compliance with the 1998 Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), WeeklySauce® is a general audience website, and does not knowingly collect, nor will ever knowingly retain, personally identifiable information from any visitor WeeklySauce® actually knows to be under thirteen years of age without the consent of that child’s parent or legal guardian.

**Third party links and co-brand relationships**

In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, WeeklySauce® may choose various third party websites to link to and from, and frame within, its own website. WeeklySauce® may also participate in co-branding and other relationships to offer information, programs and other services and features to its users. However, even if the third party is affiliated with WeeklySauce®, WeeklySauce® has no control over these linked sites, and each of these sites has separate privacy and data collection practices independent of WeeklySauce®. As such, we have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions, and are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any such websites. These linked sites are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk. Accordingly, please carefully review the data collection policies on each of these websites.
