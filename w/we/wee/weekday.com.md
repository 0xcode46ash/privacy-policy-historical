# Weekday | Privacy Policy

Weekday works to ensure that your integrity is maintained on the Internet. We have therefore produced a policy for how your personal information is used. The content of the policy can be changed on an on-going basis and therefore you should read through it again when you visit our website next time.

#### Personal details

We accept responsibility for all the personal information such as your name, address and any other personal details that you provide us with or that we find out on recruitment or in competitions. The information is kept within Weekday and its subsidiaries as the party responsible for personal data. Weekday will not pass on your personal details to third parties.

#### Why do we take your details and what are they used for?

We use the information that we collect to fulfil our commitments to you and to provide you with the service that you expect. This includes sending you information and offers for marketing purposes. In registering your interest/making an application you consent to our processing your personal details in a recruitment process. We will only store your details subsequently with your consent. It is Weekday policy not to request sensitive information from applicants via our website. Therefore do not submit sensitive information (e.g. racial/ethnic origin, political views, religious/philosophical convictions, membership of trade unions, health, sex life) when you register your interest or send your application to us. We always try to respond to applications as quickly as possible.
