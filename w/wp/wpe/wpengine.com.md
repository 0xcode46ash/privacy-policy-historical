### Privacy

## Privacy Policy

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, WPEngine collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. WPEngine’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how WPEngine’s visitors use its website. From time to time, WPEngine may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

WPEngine also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on WPEngine.com blogs. WPEngine only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to WPEngine’s websites choose to interact with WPEngine in ways that require WPEngine to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that WPEngine gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at [WPEngine.com](http://www.wpengine.com/) to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with WPEngine are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, WPEngine collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with WPEngine. WPEngine does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

WPEngine discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on WPEngine’s behalf or to provide services available at WPEngine’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using WPEngine’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. WPEngine will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, WPEngine discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when WPEngine believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of WPEngine, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an WPEngine website and have supplied your email address, WPEngine may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with WPEngine and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. WPEngine takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. WPEngine uses cookies to help WPEngine identify and track visitors, their usage of WPEngine website, and their website access preferences. WPEngine visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using WPEngine’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of WPEngine’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Ads

Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by WPEngine and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

### Comments

Comments and other content submitted to the Akismet anti-spam service are not saved on our servers unless they were marked as false positives, in which case we store them long enough to use them to improve the service to avoid future false positives.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, WPEngine may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in WPEngine’s sole discretion. WPEngine encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a WPEngine.com account, you should also check your blog’s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
