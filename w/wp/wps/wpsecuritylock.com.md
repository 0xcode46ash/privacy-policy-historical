Protecting the online privacy of children is very important, and Federal law protects those under the age of 13. For that reason, our Company does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent. If we learn at any time that we have personal information on a child under the age of 13, we will immediately delete that information from our systems and databases.

If we ever include children under the age of 13 as part of our intended Website audience, those specific web pages will, in accordance with the provisions of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ([COPPA](http://www.coppa.org/)), be clearly identified and provide an explicit privacy notice. We will provide processes to obtain parental approval and access to information, and allow parents to request removal of their child's personal information.

Our Company encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children online. For tips to help protect children's privacy online, visit the [FTC's Website](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/tech/tec08.shtm).
