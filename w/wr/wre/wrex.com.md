Online Privacy Policy 

Privacy Policy 

Copyright © 2003 WREX-TV. All rights reserved. 

WREX-TV owns and operates wrex.com. WREX-TV may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. This policy applies only to information collected by wrex.com and does not impact information collected or used by WREX-TV, wrex.com or their affiliates through other means. 

Information collected from users 

How we collect and retain information depends on the portion of the site you are accessing, the activities you elect to participate in and the services provided. You can visit many pages on our site without providing any information. Other pages may request you to provide information, such as when you register for access to portions of our site, request certain features, sign up for a newspaper subscription or make a purchase. You may also provide information when you participate in message boards, chat rooms and other interactive areas of our site. 

Like many websites, wrex.com also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. We may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use "cookie" technology. As technology progresses, we may also gather information through other means. In some cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but doing so may limit your ability to access certain portions of the site or may require you to re-enter your user name and password. 

What we do with the information we collect 

We will use your information only as permitted by law. Aggregated Information (information that does not identify you personally) may be used in many ways. Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners, but cannot be used to contact you individually. 

We also collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. For example, we may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on wrex.com to communicate with you regarding our Terms of Website Use, products and services offered by wrex.com, WREX-TV and other affiliates and partners, administration of contests, processing e-commerce transactions and other topics we think you might find interesting. We reserve the right to share this information with other WREX-TV business units and affiliates. This policy does not apply to any affiliate's use of such information. 

Personally Identifiable Information collected by wrex.com may also be used for other purposes including but not limited to site administration and troubleshooting. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site may access such information. 

We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary to give such information to law enforcement authorities. We may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases. 

Your choice to opt out 

The news and content on wrex.com is supported by advertising revenue and a controlled program of e-mail marketing is an important element of our online publishing business. We sometimes permit our advertising and promotional partners to e-mail you about services, features, products, special offers and unique content we believe might interest you. If you prefer not to receive e-mail communications sent directly from our advertisers or promotional partners, you will be given an opportunity to decline before you provide us information we might use for this purpose. If you decline at the time you provide us such information, we will not share the Personally Identifiable Information you provide with non-Affiliated advertisers for such purposes, though we may on occasion send you information on their behalf. 

Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements 

WREX-TV and wrex.com expects its partners, advertisers and third-party affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. However, third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or view certain content that was actually created or hosted by a third party. WREX-TV is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party. 

While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. Through features available on our site, third parties may use cookies or other technology to gather information. The use of cookies is standard in the Internet industry. WREX-TV and wrex.com do not control the use of this technology or the resulting information and is not responsible for any actions or policies of third parties. You may be able to set your browser to refuse cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you refuse cookies, you may limit your ability to access certain portions of wrex.com and other sites. 

Be careful and responsible when you are online. If you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on our site, such as in message boards, chat areas or in advertising or notices you post, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of WREX-TV, wrex.com and this policy.
