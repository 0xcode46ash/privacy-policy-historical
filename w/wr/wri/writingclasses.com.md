# Privacy Policy - Gotham Writers Workshop

## What information do we collect?

We collect information from you when you register on our site, place an order, subscribe to our mailing list, or respond to a survey. 

When ordering or registering on our site, you may be asked to enter your name, email address, street address, phone number, or credit card information. You may, however, visit our site anonymously. 

## What do we use your information for?

Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways: 

  * To personalize your experience  
(Your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs.) 


  * To improve our website  
(We continually strive to improve our website offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you.) 


  * To improve customer service  
(Your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service requests and support needs.) 


  * To process transactions  
(Your information, whether public or private, will not be sold, exchanged, transferred, or given to any other company for any reason whatsoever, without your consent, other than for the express purpose of delivering the purchased product or service requested.) 


  * To send periodic emails with your consent  
(The email address you provide for order processing, may be used to send you information and updates pertaining to your order. If you chose to be added to the email list, we will send you information pertaining to writing advice, news, and special deals. If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.) 



## How do we protect your information?

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. 

We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. 

After the payment transaction is complete, we save only the last four digits of your credit card number in our company database. The rest of the number is not saved in our system. 

## Do we use cookies?

Yes. We use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart, understand and save your preferences for future visits, and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. 

(Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser—if you allow—that enables the sites or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information) 

## Do we disclose any information to outside parties?

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. 

## Third party links

Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.

And anyone may change his or her information by calling Gotham Writers Workshop at 212-974-8377.

We are in compliance with the requirements of COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act). We do not collect any information from anyone under 13 years of age. Our website, products, and services are all directed to people who are at least 13-years-old.
