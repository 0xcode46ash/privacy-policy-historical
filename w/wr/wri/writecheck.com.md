### 2\. Cookies

When you visit the Site, we may place a "cookie," a small computer file containing information about the user, on your computer to help us recognize and serve you better when you return. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to personally identifiable information while on our Site. Once you close your browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our Site, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our Site. If you reject the cookie, you may still use our Site. The only drawback to this is that you will be limited in some areas of our Site. Cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Site. Some of our business partners use cookies on our Site (e.g., advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.

### 3\. Choice

When you provide personally identifiable information to us, you will be able to choose whether we may disclose such information in a personally identifiable form to a third party or whether the information may be used in personally identifiable form for purposes different from the purposes for which it was originally collected or that you have subsequently authorized.

You will have the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us when we first request your personal information. You can also opt out of receiving further communications from us by sending an e-mail to [optout@turnitin.com](mailto:optout@turnitin.com)

You can request removal of your personally identifiable information from our databases by contacting us as noted in Section 12 (Notices) below. To honor your request, we will need the exact information you want removed, and information sufficient for us to identify the type of communication you received from us.

However, even with such measures, no one is able to guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to bypass these measures or otherwise capture information you provide over the internet.

### 7\. Data Integrity

We will take reasonable steps to see that the personal information in our systems is relevant for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.
