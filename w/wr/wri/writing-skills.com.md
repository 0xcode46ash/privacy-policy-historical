We collect additional information automatically about your visit to our website (see Cookie policy, below).

Any personal information you provide via the Site may be used for the purposes outlined below. We may disclose this information to other companies in the Emphasis group and their subcontractors in connection with these purposes, but it will not be processed for other purposes or disclosed to other third parties without your express permission.

## Use of personal information

We process personal information collected via the Site for the purposes of:

  * providing and personalising our services

We may also use and disclose information in aggregate (so that no individuals are identified) for marketing and strategic development purposes.

If you access other sites using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect information from you which will be used by them in accordance with their privacy policy, which may differ from ours.

Unfortunately there is no way to prevent these cookies being set if you use our site.

YouTube, Vimeo

These cookies help power the video on our site.

### Social website cookies

We have included buttons on our site so you can easily 'Like' or share our content on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter.

Cookies are set by ShareThis, which provides several sharing buttons in one neat package 

The privacy implications of this will vary from social network to social network and will depend on the privacy settings you have chosen on those networks.

### Anonymous visitor statistics cookies

Analytics programs use cookies to compile website statistics. Unless you explicitly give us your information by filling in a form or calling us, all data that analytics programs collects is stored in an anonymous, aggregate form.

Examples include:  
•    how visitors reached our website (eg from an advert, from social networks, from Google etc)  
•    the site usage of visitors to our website (such as the number of pages viewed, time spend on individual pages, the pages visitors leave our site on)   
•    how often visitors return to our site  
•    visitor technology (eg browser, operating system, device etc)

These statistics help us make our site as user-friendly as possible, to ensure a good experience for all visitors.

We use:  
•    Google Analytics – a program that helps us measure site usage  
•    AdInsight – a phone-call tracking system that allows us to see the website usage of people who call us. This includes where callers come from, how they arrived at our website, and which pages they viewed. AdInsight is responsible for the automatically generated phone number on our pages and in our header banner. If you want to avoid giving us this information, simply call us using 01273 732 888 instead. That way no website usage information will be linked to your phone call.
