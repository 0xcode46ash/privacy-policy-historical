### What This Privacy Policy Covers

Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable, like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and which is not otherwise publicly available.

  2. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Wrike does not own or control, or to people whom Wrike does not employ or manage.




### Information Collection and Use

  1. Wrike collects personal information when you register with Wrike, when you use Wrike products or services, when you visit Wrike pages or the pages of certain Wrike partners, and when you enter promotions or sweepstakes. Wrike may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. 

  2. When you register we ask for information including your name, email address, company name and birth date. Once you register with Wrike and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. 

  3. Wrike collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners. 

  4. Wrike automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Wrike cookie information, and the page you request. 

  5. Wrike uses information for the following purposes: to fulfill your requests for products and services, customize the advertising and content you see, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. 




### Information Sharing and Disclosure

  1. Wrike does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: 

    * We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Wrike under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Wrike communicate with you about offers from Wrike and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information;

    * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; 

    * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Wrike's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. 

    * We transfer information about you if Wrike is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Wrike will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 

  2. Wrike displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria. Wrike does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. 

  3. When you share or assign task to somebody, you may disclose your or another person's contact information. Wrike has no responsibility or liability for that




### Cookies

  1. Wrike may set and access cookies on your computer. 

  2. Wrike lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Wrike's cookies. 




### Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences

  1.   2. We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the Wrike service, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the Wrike Newsletter, that are considered part of your Wrike account, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them. 

  3. You can delete your Wrike account by visiting our
