## Privacy Policy & Data Protection

(Last update: July 2014)

###  1. General

Like every digital service provider, we (WRC Promoter GmbH, Liebherrstraße 22 in 80538 Munich, Germany, hereinafter also referred to as ”WRC” or “We”) also manage personal data in connection with the use of our services, offers and websites with the URL [www.wrc.com](http://www.wrc.com/ "www.wrc.com"), [www.wrcplus.com](http://www.wrcplus.com/ "www.wrcplus.com") and our WRC application (together hereinafter referred to as “Services”). 

The following policy provides an overview of the personal data we manage, collect, process and use, the security measures we take therefore, and how you can exercise your rights regarding your personal data. Our Services may contain links to other providers’ websites that are not covered by this privacy statement.

### 2. Security 

Protecting your personal data is very important to us. We therefore handle it in compliance with applicable legal regulations in accordance with the provisions of German law. In no case will WRC forward your personal data to third parties through sale, lease, or exchange. If government agencies or authorities ask us to collect or share personal data, we will do so only within the appropriate legal frameworks.

WRC uses technical and organizational security measures to protect the data we hold about you against accidental or deliberate manipulation, loss, deletion or unauthorized access. Our security measures are being improved continuously as new technology develops. The processing and transmission of data is encrypted by the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol.

### 3. Collection and processing of personal data

WRC stores and processes your personal information if you provide it to us yourself, for example, during registration, as part of a survey or competition, registration for newsletters, subscriptions or queries from users and customers, feedback or during contractual transactions (e.g. order or subscriptions). Information qualifying as personal data would for instance be your actual name, your title, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address, age, country, your complete IP address and content or Service preferences.

We collect and process data in order to provide to you our Services and content therein. To transfer data to you, the web server collects information on the device used to access the Service, the operating system, the web browser used, the volume of data transferred, the time of access, the referrer, and the IP address stored in the server’s log file. The log files are deleted at the end of the session on the Service.

Furthermore WRC analyses traffic on the Services in order to understand our customers' requirements and, based on these, to continually improve our websites and applications. For this reason we store the IP address of a visitor’s Internet Service Provider as standard. The IP address is not linked to a specific person. Only anonymous, aggregate data is evaluated for statistical purposes during web analysis. Data from individual uses of our Services is stored for error analysis. This information is used solely for correcting errors and is deleted after a two week storage deadline. WRC uses cookies to track visitor preferences and to improve the design of its websites and applications accordingly. If ratings are submitted for a website or application, anonymized and non-personal data will be forwarded to a third party supplier. 

### 4. Cookies

Cookies are used on the Services. They are text files with information on the use of the Services (visited web pages, number of visits, time of visits, duration on individual pages, the browser used, the operating system used, etc.). Cookies can be of a lasting nature – meaning they remain until they are deleted – or temporary, in which case they are deleted, for example when a session ends. As purely text files, cookies do not intervene in your computer’s system, but only influence the presentation of content of the Services you use or visit. Usage patterns contained in cookies are evaluated anonymously to allow advertising companies to subsequently display advertising (e.g. banners) on other websites or applications targeted to the respective user’s interests. Our Services use pseudonymous cookies, each of which is assigned a random string of numbers or numbers and letters; based on this string, we can determine that the visit is from the same user. The identity of this user cannot be determined based on this string of numbers. Our service providers also use such cookies. 

In addition, the Services set a cookie with your current IP address with the last eight digits cut off. These cookies are primarily used to record the distribution of banners, pop-ups, the page view count, and the multimedia content and thus to make the use of Services easier and more effective. In no case are your personally identifiable data – name, address, and e-mail address – stored in the cookies.  

You can either set your browser to receive our cookies or use our Services without the cookie function. In this case all text entries in forms will not be saved for further enquiries. You will have to re-enter this information every time you visit our site. Your browser might show a warning message if it receives a cookie. With every query of a new WRC+ page the identification cookie needs to be sent, so the warning message can be disturbing. We recommend setting your browser to accept cookies from WRC.com and WRCplus.com. These settings can be individualized for every website.

### 5. Web/App Analysis Tools

The Services use analysis services, in particular Webtrekk and ComScore, as well as Google Analytics, which in turn use cookies. 

### 5.1 Google Analytics and Adwords

In the event that Google Analytics, a service of Google Inc. (“Google”), is used, the information on your use of our Services generated by the cookie is always transmitted to a Google server in the United States and stored there. However, within the Member States of the European Union or in other contractual states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area, Google first truncates your IP address by means of IP anonymization on this Services; we use the “–anonymize()” extension. The full IP address is transmitted to a Google server in the United States and truncated there only in exceptional cases. Google uses the generated information on our behalf to evaluate your use of our Services in order to compile reports on Services activities and to perform other services for us associated with Services use and Internet use. In no case will Google combine the IP address collected using Google Analytics with other Google data. Google will transmit the information collected using Google Analytics to third parties as required if Google is legally bound to do so or if third parties process this information on behalf of Google. You can also prevent these cookies from being stored using the aforementioned settings in your browser. 

In addition, you can object to the collection of the data generated by Google’s cookie and related to your use of the Services (incl. your IP address) and prevent processing of these data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de.

Google AdWords Remarketing is a remarketing and behavioral targeting service from Google. It links the activity on the Services with the Adwords advertising network and DoubleClick cookies. You can opt out of cookie tracking here:

### 5.2 Webtrekk Analytics

Our Services uses the web analysis services from Webtrekk GmbH, Boxhagener Strasse 76-78, 10245 Berlin, to collect statistical data about the use of our Services and to optimize our offering accordingly. The collected data are forwarded only to our statistics service provider, Webtrekk GmbH. Webtrekk GmbH is certified for data privacy in the area of web analysis. The data are collected via cookies. Your IP address is anonymized, stored, and forwarded so that you cannot be identified by means of your IP address. Webtrekk uses temporary session cookies that are deleted when you end your browser session. This also applies to last-click cookies. The collected data are deleted if they are no longer needed for evaluation or if the visitor requests their deletion. Services visitors can object to anonymized tracking of their visitor data at any time so that they are no longer collected in the future.

For more information on the type of data collection with Webtrekk, refer to Webtrekk’s data protection policy at http://www.Webtrekk.com/de/products/data-protection.html.

If you block Webtrekk tracking, a cookie with the name WebTrekkOptOut from the domain Webtrekk.net will be set on your computer. This block will be valid as long as you do not delete the cookie. To complete the opt-out process, click the following link: http://www.Webtrekk.com/de/index/dataprivacy/cookieoptout.html information such as your actual name, your mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address, and complete IP address.

### 5.3 ComScore/ScorecardResearch

ComScore/ScorecardResearch is another tracking program that we use. It is a web analysis service from Full Circle Studies, Inc. (11950 Democracy Drive, Suite 600, Reston, Virginia 20190, USA). ComScore/ScorecardResearch logs and analyses non-personally identifiable, statistical use and volume data of our users to determine their behavior at the browser level. For more information on how ComScore/ScorecardResearch collects data and how you can opt out of this service, refer to the company’s data privacy policy at http://www.scorecardresearch.com/privacy.aspx.

### 6. Social Plug-ins

### 6.1 Facebook

We use social plug-ins of the facebook.com network, specifically the “Like” and “Share” buttons. These plug-ins are offered by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA, and transmit data to Facebook. They are identified with the Facebook “f”. When this plug-in is activated, your browser establishes a connection to the Facebook servers. The content of the plug-in is transmitted directly to your browser. The plug-in is part of Facebook and merely displayed on our Services. Any interaction via the plug-in is an interaction on facebook.com and not on our Services. We do not have any influence over the content of the plug-in. Facebook also sets one or more cookies in your browser. 

Facebook receives data through the active plug-in and the cookie(s), even if you have not yet clicked the plug-in yourself and even if you do not have a Facebook account. According to Facebook’s statements, these data include the visited Services, date, time, browser type and version, operating system and version, and to our knowledge the IP address and Facebook cookies already stored in your browser. Facebook can thus track what other Services with Facebook content (including this plug-in) you visited. Facebook uses these data to detect errors in its own system; to improve its own products and adapt its own products to user behavior; to monitor, place, and individualize advertisements; for localization; for recording the way in which Services with Facebook content are used; and for market research purposes.

If you are logged into Facebook when the plug-in is activated, your Facebook login ID will also be transmitted to Facebook. In this way, your visit to our Services will be associated directly with your Facebook account. Facebook then identifies you with your Facebook name and your private data from your Facebook account. In the event of interaction with the Facebook plug-in, meaning if you click it, this information will be transmitted not only to the Facebook server, but also published on Facebook and displayed to your friends, depending on the settings of your Facebook account. If you want to prevent this, you must first log out of your Facebook account before activating the Facebook plug-in and then delete all Facebook cookies after visiting Services with Facebook plug-ins. According to Facebook’s own statements, it stores all these data for up to 90 days. After that, Facebook anonymizes these data and uses them only in anonymized and condensed form, such as to improve advertisements.

The Facebook plug-ins are set so that we do not receive any of the information that is transmitted with the plug-in or the Facebook cookies. We can determine only whether you have clicked the plug-in and shared our content with others.

For more details on how Facebook handles your data, refer to Facebook’s data privacy policy at http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/.

### 6.2 Twitter

We use social plug-ins of the Twitter short message service, specifically the “Share” button. This plug-in is offered by Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market St., Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA, and transmits data to Twitter. The plug-in is identified with the Twitter logo.

When this plug-in is activated, your browser establishes a connection to the Twitter servers. The content of the plug-in is transmitted directly to your browser. We do not have any influence over the content of the plug-in. Twitter also sets one or more cookies in your browser. Twitter receives data through the active plug-in and the cookie(s), even if you have not yet clicked the plug-in yourself and even if you do not have a Twitter account. According to Twitter’s statements, these data include the visited Services, the previously visited site, date, time, browser type, operating system, your IP address, search terms used, your location, your mobile service provider, your mobile device, your application ID, and Twitter cookies already stored in your browser (known as Twitter widgets). Twitter can thus track what other Services with Twitter content (including this plug-in) you visited. Twitter uses these data in particular for its tailored suggestions to recommend specific tweets to you; to improve the system and products; to adapt to user behavior; for localization; for recording the way in which Services with Twitter content are used; and for market research purposes. 

If you are logged into Twitter when the plug-in is activated, Twitter can establish a connection to your Twitter account. If you want to prevent this, you must first log out of your Twitter account before activating the Twitter plug-ins and then delete all Twitter cookies after visiting Services with Twitter plug-ins. 

According to Twitter’s own statements, it starts deleting widget data after ten days and the process can last up to seven days. After that, Twitter uses only condensed, anonymized data, such as how frequently a site with Twitter content was visited.

The Twitter plug-ins are set so that we do not receive any of the information that is transmitted with the plug-in or the Twitter cookies. We can determine only whether you have clicked the plug-in and shared our content with others.

For more details on how Twitter handles your data, refer to Twitter’s data privacy policy at https://twitter.com/privacy.

### 7. Limitations on use and disclosure of personal data

WRC will process and use your personal data only in connection with the Services and your subscriptions, orders, requests and the WRC newsletter. This enables us to offer you a customized service and/or can also save you from having to enter the same information twice. 

WRC occasionally works with service providers, e.g. in connection with the provision of our Services to you or other services like processing payment or dispatching mail. To the extent these service providers are provided access to your personal data, WRC complies with applicable data protection regulations, especially through corresponding commissioned data processing agreements.

Any partner services offered on the Services to you will be ordered and contracted directly with these partners. You will be advised of this accordingly. 

### 8. Accessing personal data

You may at any time request information about personal data WRC has collected about you. Where necessary, we will have to verify your identity to do so. Despite our best efforts to ensure that this stored data is accurate and up-to-date, it may be incorrect. If it is, we will correct it on written request. You can update most of your personal details yourself at any time under 'My Profile'. If changes occur to your personal details, please update your profile as soon as possible. If deletion conflicts with legal retention obligations, the data will be blocked accordingly.

### 9. Revocation of Consent

We would like to use your data to tell you about the news of the WRC as well as our offers, promotions, competitions  products and services and those of our partners, and also to conduct occasional surveys. You decide whether or not you would like to be contacted by us. If you change your mind, you can alter your preferences at any time in the 'WRC Newsletter' section under 'My Profile'.

You may – at any time – and without naming any reason, revoke a declared consent regarding a processing of your personal data by WRC with future effect. This includes our use of your personal data for sending you newsletters, answering queries, and making contact with us, and also restrict the use of your personal data for pseudonymous use profiles for purposes of improving and tailoring the design of Our services as well as advertising and market research.
