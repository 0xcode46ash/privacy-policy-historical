# Childrens Privacy Policy

Q1. | What types of information do we collect about kids?  
A1. | Kids can surf, view content, without any personal information being collected. We do not collect personal information from kids unless they sign into the Undercover Reporter Form. Typically, kids will "sign in" in order to participate in sweepstakes or contests or to participate in a special activity. The only information we collect from kids during our registration process is a kid's name, parent's e-mail address, birth date, phone number, and "news". We collect birth dates to validate the ages of our guests, including kids. We do not collect any other personally identifiable information from kids during our registration process. Note that all sites that are directed to children under 13 are prohibited by law from conditioning a kid's participation in an online activity on the kid's providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary.

We may collect personal information from parents in order to allow kids to participate in certain features located on our Web site. In the course of a kid's participation a kid may also provide us additional information about himself or herself, such as the contents of his or her chat or message board postings. If a parent allows us to collect personal information about their kid, we may link certain information collected through technology (see the "Information Collected Through Technology" section of A2 of our general Privacy Policy) to that personal information.

Q2. | How do we use and share the personally identifiable information that we have collected about kids?  
A2. | If a kid registers for a sweepstakes or contest, we use the parent's e-mail address to notify the parent of the kid's registration request (as described in detail below in A3). In addition, personal information regarding a kid may be disclosed in the course of a kid's participation in certain interactive features such as message boards and pen pal services.

We do not share any information about a kid with any other third parties unless the disclosure is reasonably necessary: to comply with law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena; to enforce our Terms of Service, or site or game rules; or to protect the safety and security of our Guests and our Web sites.

Q3. | How do we notify and obtain consent from parents for the collection of information from their kids?  
A3. | We send parents an e-mail when their kid registers and enters a sweepstakes or contest and we provide parents 48 hours to refuse their kid's registration and entry in the sweepstakes or contest. If the parent refuses to allow the kid's registration and entry, we delete the kid's information from our database. If we don't hear back from the parent, we assume it is acceptable for the kid to be registered and entered in the sweepstakes or contest. Once a parent permits a kid to register, the kid will be able to enter future registration-based sweepstakes or contests without any further notification to the parent. If a kid wins a sweepstakes or contest, we notify the parent at the parent's e-mail address provided to us during the registration process and request that the parent provide their postal address for purposes of delivering the prize. We may publish a winner's first name, first initial of last name, city, and state of residence on our Web sites.

Q4. | How can parents access, change or delete personally identifiable information about their kids?  
A4. | At any time parents can refuse to permit us to collect further personal information from their kid and can request that any personal information we have collected be deleted from our records. We use two methods to allow parents to access, change, or delete the personally identifiable information that we have collected from their kids.

  1. A parent can contact our customer service department to access, change, or delete the personal information that we have collected from his or her kid by sending an e-mail to [bookout@waaytv.com](mailto:bookout@waaytv.com). Please include the kid's member name and the parent's e-mail address in the e-mail so that we can better assist you with your inquiry or request.

Q5. | How will we notify parents if our Kids' Privacy Policy changes?  
A5. | We may amend our Kids' Privacy Policy at any time. We will provide parents notice by e-mail of any material changes in the way we intend to collect, use, and/or share kids' personal information. Please note that, at all times, parents should update their personal information to provide us current e-mail addresses. We will apply material changes in our Kids' Privacy Policy only in conformance with applicable law, including any applicable provisions of COPPA that require parental consent.

Q7.

| 

What's Undercover Reporter and what do we do with the information we receive from there?  
  
A7.

| 

Undercover Reporter is a way to let kids tell us the news that's important to them. If we do not use the news sent to us we will delete all the information that was sent to us per log in. To keep the parents in the loop we ask for the kids to give us their parents email address and we will send an email to that address showing the parent what the kid sent us. We also ask for a phone number in order for us to call if we decide to use the story.
