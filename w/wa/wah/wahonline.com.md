Also, some of our pages collect technical information about your session (such as browser type, ISP, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, number of clicks, domain name and country/state). This information may be used to analyze trends, administer our website and track usage of our website. What we collect from interactions such as this constitutes "anonymous information." Visiting the ListedinEurope.com website will also cause a ListedinEurope.com cookie to be issued. This cookie allows ListedinEurope.com to gather such anonymous or technical information. 

> **Personally Identifiable Information** means information that tells us something specific about an individual, such as their name, email address or phone number.
