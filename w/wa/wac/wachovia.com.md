# Wachovia - Privacy Policy

Policy Summary

**

At Wachovia, protecting our customers’ privacy has always been one of our highest priorities. We were one of the first financial institutions to develop and communicate a comprehensive customer privacy policy.

Effective January 1, 2001, we have revised the wording in our policy to provide additional detail about the kinds of information we have in our safekeeping and how we use that information to serve our customers.

Many federal and state laws protect customer privacy, and we continue to go beyond these comprehensive regulatory requirements to provide added protection for our customers.

We encourage you to read through our Privacy Pledge below, as well as the full wording of Wachovia’s [Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20011201192759id_/http://www.wachovia.com/privacy/privacy.asp). We also encourage you to visit our [Online Banking Security](https://web.archive.org/web/20011201192759id_/http://www.wachovia.com/onlinebanking/security.asp), [Internet Security](https://web.archive.org/web/20011201192759id_/http://www.wachovia.com/privacy/internet_security.asp), and [Wachovia's Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20011201192759id_/http://www.wachovia.com/privacy/cookies.asp) sections for additional information and tips for protecting your information online.
