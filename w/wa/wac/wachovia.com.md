# Wachovia - Privacy Policy

|   
|  | **Policy Summary**

We at Wachovia understand that our customers are concerned about their personal information.  Because of this, your privacy has always been, and always will be, one of our most important concerns. We describe fully in our [Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/privacy/privacy.asp) how we handle the various issues related to individual privacy.  We strive to protect your information according to not only federal and state laws, but, even more importantly, according to Wachovia’s own stricter standards.  Some of the key measures taken by Wachovia to protect your information can be summarized as follows:

**Collection and Use** – We will limit the collection and use of information about you to that which is necessary to administer our business, provide superior service, and offer opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you.

**Accuracy** – We will strive to ensure that the information concerning you is accurate in all aspects.  If we become aware of inaccuracies in our records, we will take prompt steps to make appropriate corrections.

**Employee Access** – We will allow only employees actively engaged in their assigned duties, as authorized by Wachovia, to have access to or use your information.  Wachovia employees are governed by a code of conduct that includes the responsibility to protect the confidentiality of each customer’s personal information.

**Third Parties** – We will share customer information with companies outside the Wachovia organization that have been hired by us to provide operational support, products and services.  These companies are not permitted to use your information for anything beyond the intended service and will be allowed access to your information only if they agree to treat it confidentially.  Also, we will exchange information about our customers with reputable information reporting agencies, financial institutions, and merchants, in accordance with standard banking industry practice, so we can verify the existence and condition of customers' accounts.

**Respecting Your Space** – We will not solicit customers by email, mail, or phone if they so choose.  You may exclude yourself from such Wachovia solicitation lists by calling our toll-free number, 1-888-226-4297.  You can call this same number if you do not wish to have your information, other than credit and experience history, shared among Wachovia affiliates.

**Internet Privacy** – We will protect your privacy on the Internet. To provide better service and a more effective Web site, we may use "[cookies](https://web.archive.org/privacy/privacy.asp#13)” as part of our interaction with your browser. These cookies do not collect personally identifiable information. You can disallow cookies by making the appropriate selection from your browser options. You should understand, however, that certain services provided by Wachovia require cookies for effective delivery.
