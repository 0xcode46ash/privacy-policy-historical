## How We Gather Information to Understand Your Financial Needs

The information we gather about you helps us to better understand your financial needs and to provide more personalized, efficient service to you.  For example, this information may prompt us to suggest overdraft protection for your checking account, or recommend an investment product that has the potential to pay you higher earnings.  

The information we gather comes from a variety of sources, including:

  * Information you provide to us (such as information on applications about assets and income).
  * Information related to your transactions with Wachovia (such as account balance and payment history).
  * Information we receive from credit reporting agencies and other companies (such as your credit history) when you apply for a service.
  * Information we obtain from others at your request (such as information about assets held at another institution for inclusion in a financial plan).
  * Information obtained when you use Internet products and services (such as application and transaction information and information contained in e-mails you send us).



We carefully manage all the information gathered about you as described in the following section.

## How We Manage Information to Serve Your Needs

_Within Wachovia Corporation_

We consolidate information about customers within the companies that make up Wachovia Corporation, including: 

  * Information based on your transactions with us (for example, information that we would collect about your loan amounts and deposits with us in order to offer you a rate based on total balances) and contact information (such as your name and address). 
  * Credit information received from you or others (such as information from your credit application or your employment or credit history) to evaluate your eligibility for various financial services (for example, a line of credit at a special rate).



You may tell us not to share credit information with other Wachovia companies*.  For more information, see the section below entitled, Your Choices as a Customer.

_Outside of Wachovia Corporation_

Other than limited exceptions like those below, we do not provide customer information to companies outside of Wachovia Corporation.  You do not need to request this confidentiality; it is our standard practice. 

In order to serve your needs, we may provide all of the information we gather to:

  * Service providers that perform business operations for us (such as check printing)
  * Companies that act on our behalf to market our services, or companies with whom we have entered into a joint marketing agreement in order to provide you with valuable financial services that we do not offer  (such as credit cards)*
  * Others only as permitted or required by law (such as to protect against fraud or in response to a subpoena)



We select very carefully the companies that provide services on our behalf, or offer you financial services that we do not provide.   Also, we only provide them with information that we believe is necessary to fulfill their responsibilities or to provide a financial service to you. These companies are prevented by legal agreement from using this information for their own purposes or selling this information to others.

***Other Applicable Laws**

The practices described above are in accordance with federal law.   You may have other protections under applicable state laws, such as Vermont and California.  To the extent these state laws apply, we will comply with them when we share information about you.  For example, Vermont law places additional limits on sharing information about Vermont residents.  As long as they remain residents of Vermont, we will not share information we collect about Vermont residents to companies outside of Wachovia, except:

  * To companies that perform marketing or other services on our behalf;

  * Contact information (like name and address), and transaction information (such as your payment history) to other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements;

  * With the authorization or consent of the Vermont resident; or

  * As permitted by law.




We also will not share credit information about Vermont residents received from others within Wachovia except with the authorization or consent of the Vermont resident.

## Your Choices as a Customer

We are committed to helping you manage your finances in the most effective way, and helping you maximize the return on your financial investments.  For these reasons, we may contact you to offer financial advice and inform you of different options that may be of value to you.  If you are comfortable with the ways in which we contact you currently, there is no need to indicate your preferences.  We recognize, however, that you may wish to limit the ways in which we contact you for marketing purposes and we offer the options listed below:

  1. Please do not contact me by telephone for marketing purposes.

  2. Please do not contact me by mail for marketing purposes.

  3. Please do not contact me by e-mail for marketing purposes.




You also have a choice about how information about you is managed within Wachovia.   If you prefer that we not share credit information about you with other Wachovia companies, you may choose the following option:

  4. Please do not share, among Wachovia companies, credit information about me that you receive from me or others.




Whatever your preferences, we will honor your wishes and respect your privacy.  Your preferences will remain in effect until you tell us otherwise.  You do not need to notify us if you have already indicated your preferences to us. 

**To discuss your options, inform us of a preference, or provide us with feedback, call us at (866) 203-5722 (Command Asset Program, IRA, Brokerage and Insurance customers should call (877) 358-1114), visit a Wachovia financial center or complete our online  [Consumer Privacy Preference Form](https://www.wachovia.com/personal/forms/privacy_optout)** **.**

If you contact us, we will assume your preferences apply to you only - unless you tell us that they also apply to other individuals listed on your accounts.

Please note that we are committed to providing you with superior service.  Occasionally, we may need to contact you to resolve a problem or to service your accounts.  For example, if we observe unusual activity on your debit card, we may contact you to verify your purchases and confirm that they are authorized.
