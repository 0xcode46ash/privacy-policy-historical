# CEB Privacy Policy - CEB

CEB Inc. ("CEB", “we” or “us”) is committed to protecting your personal information.

This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") explains how we collect and use personal information that you provide: via our public website [www.cebglobal.com](http://www.cebglobal.com/) and our member-based websites (which are listed on our public website) (the "Sites"); through our CEB mobile application (“CEB App”); or offline when participating in any Member Program run by CEB, including the CEB International Executive Forums operated by the CEO Forum Group. The Sites do _not_ include our CEB Iconoculture website, which is subject to its own [privacy policy](https://iconoculture.com/Popups/PrivacyStatement/index.aspx). The Policy applies to all Sites and services where the Policy is posted.

This Policy also applies to information we collect from you and/or your employer via our survey tools. Depending on where you are resident, you may be shown a confidentiality notice before participating in a survey. Please note that in cases where the terms of any such survey-specific confidentiality notice conflict with any terms in this Policy, the survey-specific terms will take precedence over the terms in this Policy.

If you participate in the Shared Services Leadership Council, please refer to the information in this section below for Shared Services-specific terms.

Personal information collected via our Talent Management assessment systems is _not_ covered by this Privacy Policy and will be governed by the terms of the specific Data Protection Notice (“DPN”) shown at the beginning of each assessment.

Please read this Policy before you provide any personal information to us. By using our Sites, CEB App, survey tools or participating in our Member Programs and Shared Services Leadership Council, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined in this Policy. If you do not agree with the content of this Policy, you should not provide us with any personal information.

  * to attribute content that you make available through the Sites;
  * to communicate with you about surveys, marketing, promotions, executive-oriented events, educational forums, and other exclusive opportunities offered by CEB and its subsidiaries, partners, and affiliates, including information about other Programs in which you may be interested (for further details, please see the section “Choices About Your Information” below);

  * to ensure the technical functioning of the Sites.



_Member Profiles_ _._ On some of our Sites, you may be able to create an online profile, which may include information about your job title, employer, and your experience in different areas.  This profile enables other Members participating in the Member program to determine whether your background and expertise might make you a useful contact on a particular issue. You can choose how much, if any, of your profile information is displayed in Member listings or when you post discussion messages in the Discussion areas, and whether to make your information searchable by other Members in your particular Member program. When you create an online profile and choose to (i) display any of your profile information in the Member listings or when you post discussion messages; or (ii) make your profile information searchable by other Members; you acknowledge and agree that you are making that information about you available to other Members who might use that information to contact you via messages sent through the Sites to obtain the benefit of your expertise.

### Choices About Use of Your Information

We believe that it is important to give you choices about the use of your information. We will use your information as described in this Policy or any service-specific privacy or data protection notice. If we want to use your personal information for a purpose not described in this Policy, we will first obtain your consent to do so.

_Marketing Communications_ : We will respect your wishes not to receive, or to stop receiving, marketing communications. You can change your marketing preferences by contacting us as described below. If you provided us with your email address in order to receive such communications, you can opt out at any time by using the unsubscribe links or instructions at the bottom of our emails. Please note that we will continue to send you service-related communications regardless of any such request. We will _not_ share or sell your information and personal details with third parties (for the avoidance of doubt, other than subsidiaries and/or affiliates) for their own promotional or marketing purposes unless you give us consent to do so and where permitted by applicable law.

_California Online Privacy Protection Act Notice Concerning Do Not Track Signals_ : Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. We do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT. To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do so [here](http://allaboutdnt.com/).

### Disclosure of Information

_Utilization information_. We may share information with our organizational Members about how their employees use the Sites and the resources available to them through the Sites (e.g. how employees used certain features of the Sites, utilization trends, which features were most popular with the Member’s employees.)

We may share your information with third-party companies or individuals in the following instances:

  * When we engage service providers and third-party agents to process personal information on our behalf. When we do so, we contractually require these service providers to implement adequate security and privacy measures to ensure that your personal information will be appropriately protected and only used for the purposes of performing the services for us.
  * In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process (including for national security and law enforcement purposes); to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.
  * When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the justified rights, property, or safety of CEB or its subsidiaries, our customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Service and other agreements.
  * In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, including any pre-transaction diligence, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.



We also may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers, investors, and partners. Aggregate or anonymous information does not contain any personal information and its use and disclosure is not subject to the terms of this Policy. 

### International Transfers of Personal Information

We operate the Sites in the United States and, depending on your country of residence, the submission of personal information to our Sites may involve the transfer of personal information to the United States.

In addition, we may transfer personal information to our [subsidiaries or affiliated companies](https://www.cebglobal.com/about/contact-us.html) and service providers and/or third party agents in various countries, including the United Kingdom, India, Australia, Canada, Germany (and other EU Member States), Singapore, or South Africa for certain processing operations. You should be aware that privacy laws in these countries may not provide protections equivalent to those of your country of residence.

All CEB entities have signed an Intragroup Agreement containing the European Union (“EU”) Commission Approved Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of data outside the European Economic Area. All CEB entities have the same technical, physical, and administrative security controls and are required to comply with our data protection policies and procedures, applicable laws, and the terms of our client and member contracts governing the collection and use of personal information.

CEB Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary SHL US, LLC comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries, and are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the United States Federal Trade Commission. CEB Inc and its wholly-owned subsidiary SHL US, LLC adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  

CEB’s accountability for personal information that we receive under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfer to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, we remain responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that we engage to process the personal information on our behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

More information about the Privacy Shield program can be found at <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>.

In some cases, you may directly access your online profiles and other personal details, and amend, update or add information yourself at any time by logging into your account.

You may request access to any personal information that we hold about you, ask us to correct any personal information which may be inaccurate, and/or ask us to block or delete such information and object to the processing of personal data except where the law requires otherwise. Please note that in cases where your employer is the Data Controller of such information, we will need to obtain their permission before making such changes.

### Information Security

We have implemented reasonable technical and organizational security measures to help protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be entirely secure, and we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information that you transmit on or through our Sites or the CEB App or that we otherwise maintain.

We make reasonable efforts to restrict access to personal information to only those employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our Programs, products, and services. We subject our third-party agents to contractual controls to ensure that they appropriately protect and use any personal information they access or receive from us.

Please note that the effective security with respect to our Sites depends, in part, on you ensuring that any IDs and passwords that you have been issued by us are kept confidential and secure and that you adhere to the restrictions on password and ID-sharing set forth in our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/content/cebglobal/us/en/terms-of-service.html).

### Other Websites

To provide increased value to you, we may provide links to other websites or resources that are not part of the network of Programs, products, or services run by CEB or its subsidiaries. We do not exercise control over these websites or their privacy practices, and any information you provide to those sites is subject to the Privacy Policies of those sites and not this Policy.
