# WANTED Analytics - Privacy Policy

### Overview

This privacy policy applies to Wanted Technologies Corporation's ("Wanted" or "us") "WANTED Analytics" service (the "Service") available at [www.wantedtech.com](http://www.wantedtech.com/) or [www.wantedanalytics.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20111231170249id_/http%3A//) (the "Sites"). 

To demonstrate our commitment to the privacy of the users of the Service, we wish to disclose our information practices with respect to the Service: 

  * What personally identifiable information Wanted collects 
  * How Wanted uses that information 
  * With whom Wanted may share user information 
  * What choices are available to users regarding collection, use and distribution of the information 
  * What types of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Wanted's control 
  * How users can correct any inaccuracies in the information 
  * If you have questions or concerns regarding this privacy statement, please contact us at: . 



### Information Collection and Use

If you are an individual, when you sign up for the Service, Wanted will ask for information allowing us to identify you and create your password-protected account, such as your full name, address, employer, e-mail address and telephone number. In the case of corporate users of the Service, Wanted will ask for the same information with respect to the employee(s) or other person(s) authorized to use the Service on the corporation's behalf. This information will be used to create and maintain your account for as long as you are a user of the service (and in the case of corporate users, for as long as the employee(s) or other person(s) remain authorized to use the Service on the corporation user's behalf), unless and to the extent a longer retention is permitted or required by law. 

### General

You may withdraw your consent to our use of your personal information at any time by contacting us at . However, withdrawing your consent will prevent you from having access to the Service. 

Wanted is not responsible for the privacy policies and content of any website to which the Sites link. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of these sites, as they will differ from ours. 

Wanted uses all reasonable precautions to keep secure any information we collect as part of our secure network. We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of data under our control. 

### Integrity

Wanted collects and stores personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this statement. Our goal is to only collect, store and process such personal information that is needed to provide or improve our service offering. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we use is accurate, complete, and current, but it is ultimately the users that are in a position to allow us achieving that goal and by updating or correcting their personal information whenever necessary. 

### Accessing and updating

We take reasonable steps to provide you with access to your personal information and to either correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete that data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law. In order to do so, we will ask individuals to identify themselves and which information they would like to access, correct or remove before processing such requests. In any case, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require disproportionate efforts on our part. 

### Information security

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized disclosure or destruction of data, including any personal information collected and stored on its infrastructure. These include internal monitoring of our processes, practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal information. 

We restrict access to personal information only to our employees, contractors and agents who need to access or know that information in order to develop, operate or improve our service offering. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. 

### Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement on the Sites and other places that we deem appropriate so our users are aware of what information we collect and how we use it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy statement under which the information was collected. If, however, we are going to use your personal and contact information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will obtain your consent prior to this new use. 

### Sharing Information

WANTED may retain third party service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the Service or other aspects of WANTED's business. Such service providers include payment processors, data storage facilities and professional advisors. These service providers are subject to confidentiality obligations towards WANTED. If you become a paying customer of the Service, you agree that WANTED can disclose to such third party services providers your personal information, the fact that you are a paying customer and the edition of the Service that you are using. 

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may also need to disclose personal information when required by law if we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with an appropriate law enforcement investigation, current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website. 

We may enter into discussions or negotiations with a third party (anywhere in the world) regarding the sale of all (or substantially all) of our business or the acquisition of a controlling interest in our share capital. Since customer information and data would normally be a part of such a transaction, Wanted reserves the right to transfer any information you submit and we retain to that third party as part of due diligence activities or to complete the transaction.

If you require further information or if we can be of any assistance with respect to privacy issues, updating your contact information, or the practices of the Sites, please contact us at .
