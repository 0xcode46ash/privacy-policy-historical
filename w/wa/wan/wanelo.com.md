# Wanelo - Privacy Policy

Last modified on May 25, 2018.

We at Wanelo, Inc. ("Wanelo," or "we," "us," "our") know that you as our users care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By visiting or using the wanelo.com website and domain name, and any other linked pages, features, content, or any other services we offer (collectively, the "Website"), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you consent to our collecting, using, and sharing your information in the following ways. Any capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meaning given to them in our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/about/terms).

### What does this Privacy Policy cover?

This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that we gather when you are accessing or using our Website. For all orders and purchases made through Wanelo, please see our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/about/terms), and in particular, the section "Purchases on Wanelo," for information about the data we collect and share when you make a purchase through Wanelo. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage. This policy also does not apply to information you choose to disclose publicly on the Website (i.e., information which is viewable to other Website users), which will not be considered Personal Information. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Services (as that term is defined in our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/about/terms)). If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to us or on the Services. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at [privacy@wanelo.com](mailto:privacy@wanelo.com).

### What personal information does Wanelo collect?

The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services and to allow our users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with other users through the Website. We collect the following types of information from our customers:

#### Personal information you provide to us

We receive and store any information you provide to us. The types of Personal Information collected may include your real name, username, email address, age, birthday, gender, IP address, location, language, transaction related data such as zip code, billing address and shipping address, browser information, browsing history, transactions, listings created, comments, photos posted, and reviews posted, and any other information necessary for us to provide our services as well as credentials you provide us to link your Wanelo account with third-party services such as Facebook and Twitter. If you provide your third-party account credentials to us, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts ("Third Party Account Information") may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Website is covered by this Privacy Policy. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features. We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you cannot be individually identified, and provide that information to our partners.

#### Personal information collected automatically

  * Whenever you interact with our Website, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, "cookie" information, and the page you requested.
  * "Cookies" are identifiers we transfer to your computer through your browser that allow us to recognize your browser or mobile device and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. We may also record the referring page that linked you to us; the page you visit after our site; the ads you see; the ads you click on; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Web Site or a referral site; and other usage activity and data logged by our servers. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser to prevent or limit your computer's acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of Wanelo's best features. Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your computer, when you click on ads that appear on our site. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
  * When we collect usage information (such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to the Website), we only use this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. For example, this aggregate data tells us how often users use parts of the Website, so that we can make the Website appealing to as many users as possible. We may also provide this aggregate information to our partners, so that they can understand how often people use their services and our Website, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. We never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.



#### Email and other communications

When you register for the first time on Wanelo, you will be asked if you would like to receive (1) email notices, which will include notification if someone sends you a message or invites you to join a Wanelo list or group, new friend or follower requests, (2) Wanelo newsletters and announcements and marketing and promotional materials, (3) notification of new activity on your lists, and notices about public Wanelo activity by your friends or followers. You may opt in to receive these notices and communications. If you do not want to receive these, you may opt out. If you choose to opt out, keep in mind that some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our special features. We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make emails more interesting and improve our service. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, you may opt out at any time. You may also indicate or change your preference on your [Settings](https://web.archive.org/settings) page, and send us an email at [privacy@wanelo.com](mailto:privacy@wanelo.com) requesting such a change. If you elect to become a friend or follower of a Brand Profile Page (a page in the Wanelo community that displays brands, products or goods of a merchant), the administrator of the page (a "Brand Admin") may send you messages containing commercial and promotional messages. You may opt out of receiving those messages by following instructions that will appear on the in-system message. If you send an email using the service to an email address that is not registered in our community, we do not use that email address for any purpose other than to send your email. We do not rent or sell these email addresses, nor do we send them marketing messages. Other users may send emails and messages to you via the Wanelo service. Wanelo does not review these messages before they are sent to you.

If you provide Wanelo with your mobile phone number on our Website and you opt-in to receive marketing messages to your mobile phone number, Wanelo may send you text messages (including SMS and MMS) to your phone number. At any time, you may opt out of receiving marketing or advertising text messages by contacting us at [privacy@wanelo.com](mailto:privacy@wanelo.com) and providing the phone number that you would like opted out.

### Will Wanelo share any of the personal information it receives?

We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We share your Personal Information only as described below.

#### Advertisers

We may allow advertisers and/or merchant partners ("Advertisers") to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers and you agree that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers. For example, we might use the fact you are located in San Francisco to show you ads or offers for San Francisco businesses, but we will not tell such businesses who you are. We may deliver a file to you through the Website (known as a "web beacon") from an ad network. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network's servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.

#### Affiliated businesses and third-party websites we do not control

In certain situations, businesses or third-party websites we're affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Website (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with a Wanelo transaction or service by a store’s information published on store pages, product pages and details on order confirmation materials. In these cases, we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is necessary for transaction or service. One such service may include the ability for you to choose to automatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your Website profile or to automatically transmit information in your Website profile to your third-party account. We have no control over the policies and practices of third-party websites as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to allow these automatic transmissions, please review all third-party websites' policies, and especially their privacy policy, which may be different from ours.

#### Agents

We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them so we can provide products or services to you. For example, we use Stripe to process payments. Unless we tell you differently and obtain your consent, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.

#### User profiles

User profile information, including without limitation your name, email address, and other information ("User Submissions") may be displayed to other users only if you chose to enter such information on your user profile. Your user profile is public on the Website. Again, any User Submissions (including without limitation images, captions, and comments) you voluntarily provide and disclose for other users to view on the Website is not protected by Wanelo; it becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others, and may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels. Additionally, if you sign into the Website through a third party social networking site or service, your list of "friends" from that site or service may be automatically imported to the Website, and such "friends," if they are also registered users of the Website. Again, we do not control the policies and practices of any other third party site or service.

#### Communication about the website

As part of the Website and Services, you will receive communications from us about the Website, whether by email, mobile phone or any other means to which you have consented. We and our agents may send you email, contact you, or engage you in communication related to your use of the Website and updates to the Website and its policies.

#### Promotional offers

If you opt in to receive promotional and marketing materials, we will send you offers for Wanelo and on behalf of other businesses. However, when we do so, we provide only your email address and do not give the other business your name and address. If you no longer wish to receive these offers, please send us an email at [privacy@wanelo.com](mailto:privacy@wanelo.com).

#### Business transfers

If we (or substantially all of our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, Personal Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.

#### Protection of Wanelo and others

We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Wanelo, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

#### With your consent

You will always have the right to opt-out of any use of your Personal Information at any time, and to retrieve, change or delete your Personal Information. This policy explains when your Personal Information will be shared with third parties and when you will receive different communications if you choose to opt in. If you have any questions on this policy or need to change your consents at any time, please send us an email at privacy@wanelo.com.

### Is personal information about me secure?

Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. If you access your account via a third-party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-in protections via that third-party site or service. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-in mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. Wanelo transfers Personal Information provided by you within the United States and Canada. We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. In the event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we will notify you of that development as soon as possible, and, we will do so by the email associated with your account. The Website may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When linking to another site you should read that site's privacy policy.

### Access to, and Correction and Deletion of Personal Information

Through your user profile, you may access, correct, update, edit or delete your Personal Information at any time, or any of the information you provide to us.

If you are a European resident, you have the right to access personal information we hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to exercise this right, please contact us [privacy@wanelo.com](mailto:privacy@wanelo.com). Additionally, if you are a European resident, we note that we are processing your information in order to fulfill contracts we might have with you (for example if you make an order through the Website), or otherwise to pursue our legitimate business interests listed above. Additionally, please note that your information will be transferred outside of Europe, including to Canada and the United States.

The information you can view, update, correct, and delete through your user profile may change as the Website changes. If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you or if you need to exercise any right under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, please contact us at [privacy@wanelo.com](mailto:privacy@wanelo.com).

### Data Retention

We will keep your Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we are processing your Personal Information unless the law permits or requires us to retain it for a longer period.

### What choices do I have?

  * You can always opt not to disclose information, but keep in mind that some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our special features.
  * You may be able to add, update, or delete certain information as explained in Section above. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.
  * You may close your account via the 'Close Account' link on [Settings](https://web.archive.org/settings). Please note that some information may remain in our private records after the closing of your account.
  * If you do not wish to receive email or other mail from us, please email us at [privacy@wanelo.com](mailto:privacy@wanelo.com). Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Website, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.



### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we use Personal Information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on our Website or sending you an email. You are bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when you use the Website after such changes have been first posted.
