:: OUR PRIVACY POLICY 

We are committed to protecting our user’s privacy. To that end, we offer this statement to inform our users of how we define, gather and utilize personal information. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify or otherwise alter this policy at any time. Such changes and/or modifications shall become effective immediately upon the posting thereof. Without limiting the foregoing, we may occasionally notify you by email about changes to the Site or provide notices of changes by displaying notices or links to notices to you generally on the Site. Please review this policy periodically. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes and/or modifications will constitute your acceptance of the revised privacy policy.

We define personal information as information that includes a person's full name, address, telephone number, date of birth and/or email address or any other information that is tied to individually identifiable information that would allow someone to identify or contact you, unless stated otherwise herein or on the Site. We can gather information on our users in two different ways: (1) cookie technology; and (2) voluntary submissions. 

We utilize cookie technology to collect data regarding the number of visits a person has made to our site. This data is stored in aggregate form and is in no way singled out in an individual file. This information allows us to know what pages/sites are of interest to our users and what pages/sites may be of less interest. Such information is utilized in revising the website to better meet our user’s needs and interests. 

We also collect personally identifiable information from users through voluntary submissions. We use good faith efforts to make it clear why the information is being collected and what it will be used for. In the event that this information is being shared with a third party affiliate, sponsor or advertiser, we will use good faith efforts to post a notice on the Site clearly stating that the information is being shared and/or give the user the opportunity to opt-in to authorize the sharing of such information. 

Unless specified otherwise on the Site, users must be 18 years or older before registering in any of our sweepstakes or contests. When sweepstakes or contests are open to users 13-17 years old, we will collect only first and last names, phone numbers and email addresses for prize fulfillment purposes only, unless otherwise stated on the Site. 

If a sweepstakes or contest winner is under 18 years old, we will require a consent form signed by the winner's parent or guardian in order to award the prize. We have taken steps to ensure that personally identifiable information collected is secure, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to its database servers, as well as electronic security systems and password protections which guard against unauthorized access.
