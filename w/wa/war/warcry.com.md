# WarCry Network - The Front Line of Entertainment!

This document describes the privacy practices for WarCry Network (“WarCry”) and its affiliated companies. It makes it clear how WarCry treats personal information that WarCry collects and receives, including information related to your past use of WarCry products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.

The websites maintained by WarCry’s affiliates and business partners post and administer their own privacy policies regarding the use of your information. Please read these policies carefully before taking advantage of their services.

This policy makes clear that WarCry could merge with or be acquired by another entity. Should this occur, you should expect that WarCry would share some or all of your information with the other entity.

## How We Collect Information

WarCry collects personal information when you visit WarCry pages or the pages of WarCry partners, and when you submit user information to WarCry or you use WarCry products or services. WarCry may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.

## Information We Collect Via Log Files and Cookies

While a user is on the WarCry network, we automatically track certain information through log files and, on some pages, through cookies. This information includes a user’s most recent visit, the URL they came from, the URL they visit next, the browser they are using, and their IP address.

## Information We Collect Via User Submission

We may ask users for personal information when they: 

  * Register with WarCry;
  * enter a sweepstakes, contest, or promotion, either sponsored by us or one of our business partners; 
  * take one of our polls or fill out a marketing survey; 
  * sign up for and/or use WarCry services; or
  * ask to receive any of our newsletters.



When providing WarCry with information, you may be asked for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, and zip code. Once you register with WarCry and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.

## How We Use the Information We Collect: 

  * to better understand the demographics, interests and behavior of our collective audience;
  * to deliver advertisements and promotions targeted to our users’ interests 
  * to deliver prizes;
  * to deliver promotional information from WarCry or its sponsors, provided the user opted in for these notifications. 



## Information Collected by Third-Party Advertisers 

We may use third party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit WarCry. Often, these companies employ cookie and 1x1 pixel technology to collect and use anonymous information about your visits to our member websites and other websites to track the performance of an ad program. This does not include your name, address, e-mail or telephone number but will include the date and time of your visit, your IP address, the URLs of sites you visit and the banner ad that was shown.

To stop a third-party advertiser from employing cookies on your computer, you may opt out by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) site. [Click here for the NAI site](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp).

## Who Else Might See The Information We Collect

WarCry does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or to the following: 

  * Our business development partners who provide services to WarCry and its users, who each maintain their own privacy policies.
  * Advertisers and partners using aggregate anonymous data to profile our collective audience.
  * Third parties with whom our partners share aggregate anonymous information.
  * Advertising agencies, consultants, and market research companies pursuant to confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help WarCry communicate with you. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
  * Law enforcement, other government officials or third parties to comply with applicable law or legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public, or if a user violates WarCry's terms of service.



## How You Can Delete, Update or Correct Your Information With WarCry

To delete, update or correct personal information or to stop receiving promotional e-mails from WarCry, send a message to privacy@warcry.com at any time. A user can also unsubscribe from WarCry’s newsletter and promotional databases by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of every newsletter and promotional email.

## How Your Information Is Protected

WarCry takes reasonable precautions to protect information you transmit from loss, misuse or alteration by using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to protect sensitive information and a series of firewalls to protect our internal systems.

## Children Under 13

Our sites may not be used by children under 13. WarCry prohibits registration by, and WarCry will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from, anyone under 13. This requirement will be posted at points of data collection within WarCry, such as registration for services.

## Amendments

WarCry may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended Policy on WarCry. The amended Policy shall automatically take effect for new users from the day it posted on WarCry and 30 days after it is first posted on WarCry for registered users.
