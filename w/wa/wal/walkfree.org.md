# Privacy Policy and Legal Terms | Freedom United

#### INTRODUCTION

Freedom United (“Freedom United,” “we,” or “us”) values and respects your concerns about privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we use, disclose and protect the personal information of people who use our website or otherwise join or support Freedom United in the ways described below.

Freedom United is a nonprofit initiative that includes the freedomunited.org website, social media accounts and related databases. By visiting www.freedomunited.org, or by sharing personal information with Freedom United, you are agreeing to and accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy, so please review it carefully.

The www.freedomunited.org website is maintained by Audacity Factory, a U.S. 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA, telephone +1 984-500-3725.

#### WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person. We generally collect or receive personal information in three ways: (1) you voluntarily provide information to us, such as when you register with or input information into our website, donate to us (online or offline), sign a petition, contact us, or attend one of our events, (2) we collect information automatically, such as through cookies or through use of our website, and (3) other parties, such as social networks, may provide information to us or grant us access to information which can be reasonably linked to you. Each of these methods is described in more detail below.

##### Information You Voluntarily Choose to Provide

The personal information we collect from you will vary depending on the services you are using, the websites you are visiting, and how you access those services and websites. The personal information you provide to us may include the following: first and last name, street address, city, state, zip code, country, telephone number, email address, and subject of inquiry.

##### Information Collected Automatically When You Use Our Websites

Like most websites, we collect basic web traffic information (such as IP addresses) to monitor overall usage of our site. This helps us understand traffic patterns and know if there are problems on the site. We use embedded images in emails to track open rates for our campaigns, so that we can learn better how to keep members of our community engaged with the fight against modern slavery. We also use URLs (website links) in emails with an identifier that allows us to correctly identify the person who takes an action using a web page, so we can know who are our most active members and what initiatives they support.

Cookie technology is used on several parts of our website. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to a computer, tablet or smartphone to analyze website usage and to facilitate transactions and a more personalized website experience. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. If you do not wish to receive any cookies you may set your browser to refuse cookies. This may mean you will not be able to take full advantage of all the functions on the Freedom United website.

##### Information We Receive from Others

In some cases, other parties provide us with personal information about you, or allow us to collect personal information about you. In some cases, we are not able to control the amount or type of information that other parties like social networks, make available to us. Although we cannot control your privacy settings at those websites or how those other parties protect your privacy, once we receive information about you through those websites, we will treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

#### HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

As a general matter, Freedom United uses your personal information to provide the services or information you request. We also may use your personal information to:

  * stay in contact with you, let you know of new opportunities to take part in the fight against modern slavery, and provide you with updates and information;
  * better understand our users, their interests, and their preferences;
  * develop, deliver, and improve our services and other offerings; and
  * for internal purposes such as auditing and data analysis.



We also collect information in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.

#### WHEN MIGHT WE GIVE ANYONE ELSE ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

Freedom United will not disclose your personal information to any third parties except:

  * to our related companies;
  * to third parties appointed by Freedom United to provide services on our behalf, including, without limitation, our contractors, website and data hosting providers, email or SMS providers, technology service providers, advertising partners, campaign partners and other persons who perform services for us – in which case, Freedom United uses reasonable steps to ensure such third parties keep your personal information confidential and do not use or disclose your personal information for any purpose other than the purpose of providing those services to us;
  * to our professional advisers, accountants, insurers, lawyers and auditors on a confidential basis;
  * if Freedom United or its assets are or may be acquired by a third party, the information may be provided to that third party and its advisors;
  * in exceptional circumstances, Freedom United may be required or permitted by law to disclose personal information, for example when it is necessary for something you have requested from us and when necessary to protect someone’s safety, rights or property; or
  * otherwise with your consent.



Except as set forth above, we do not provide your personal information to other groups. From time to time we might let you know about an exciting or important campaign being run by a partner organization in the fight against modern day slavery. When we do this, Freedom United will let you know, and will not disclose any of your personal information to such an organization without your consent and without securing a suitable written agreement with the other organization for the proper use of this information.

For our campaigns to be effective, it is important that our members and supporters make a public stand in the fight against slavery. So if you participate in specific campaign actions such as adding your name to a petition, uploading a video to our site or writing a letter to a news media organization, your information may be available publicly on our website. Personal information on our website may include your comments, along with your first name, last initial, and your country.

#### HOW DOES FREEDOM UNITED KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SECURE?

Freedom United is committed to keeping your information secure. We endeavor to take all reasonable steps to keep secure any information that we hold about you, and to keep this information accurate and up to date. Your information is stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities. Other than the sharing of information outlined in this Privacy Policy, personally identifiable information is not accessible by the public, and we require our employees and data processors to respect the confidentiality of any personal information. Any personally identifiable information on user profiles is private.

#### USE OF OUR WEBSITE EMAIL TOOL

In some campaigns, we offer a function in which members can write a message to their head of state, a company CEO, a news organization or other decision makers. These messages are sent in your name, with your contact information such as your email address as the return address. Please review the content of these messages carefully because as they are sent from your email address and not from Freedom United, you are responsible for the content of these messages.

#### HOW CAN YOU STOP RECEIVING EMAIL FROM FREEDOM UNITED?

If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from our email list, you may do so by clicking on the Unsubscribe link included in each of our emails or by using this contact form and we will remove your name from our lists. You can also send a request to our mailing address below. We will act quickly to implement such requests but please note there may be time lags of up to a month to remove names from our database.  
If you would like to verify, update or change the contact information we have received from you, please contact us.

#### DONATIONS OR PURCHASES

Any financial information is sent via a secure server and encrypted for your protection. Freedom United does not see, store, or retain credit card numbers. Credit card information is submitted directly to Stripe.com, a trusted payment processor that processes your financial transactions.

#### CHILDREN’S PRIVACY

We do not direct our websites or services to children (usually considered to be under the age of 13, depending on the country where you reside). We also do not intentionally collect personal information from children through our websites or applications. If you are the parent or guardian of a child and you believe that we have inadvertently received personal information about that child, please contact us as described in the Contact Us section of this Privacy Policy and we will take reasonable steps to remove the information from our records.

#### GAINING ACCESS TO YOUR INFORMATION

If at any time you want to request, update or remove personal information, you are welcome to submit a request by using this contact form. We may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.

We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).

Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.

#### LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES

The Freedom United website contains links to other websites. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of linked sites, as Freedom United is not responsible for the practices or privacy policies of those sites.

#### FUTURE REVISIONS

Freedom United’s website and activities will continue to grow and change as we add new ways to make your voice heard in the fight against slavery. Because of this, from time to time, our Privacy Policy will be reviewed and revised. Freedom United reserves the right to modify its website and/or this Privacy Policy at any time and donors and visitors are deemed to be apprised of and bound by any such modifications. Whenever we change our Privacy Policy we will post an updated version on our website, including the last date of revision.

This Privacy Policy was last revised on 16 February 2017.
