# Walk Free Privacy Policy and Legal Terms - Walk Free

### Introduction

Walk Free is an initiative of Hope for Children Organisation Australia Ltd a not-for-profit organisation that operates the walkfree.org website.

This policy explains how we protect the personal information of people who use our website. Walk Free values and respects the privacy of our members. We believe you have a right to control how your personal information is collected and used. Except where we get your consent, we will not share your personal information with unaffiliated organisations.

### What information do we collect?

Walk Free collects limited information about our members and supporters such as contact details, the country you are from and how you came into contact with us. We collect this information in a range of different situations, such as when someone visitors our website, when they sign a petition, when they come to an event or when a partner organisation joins a campaign that Walk Free is running. Our information systems also collect information about the way that you use our website, so that we can continue to improve our website and our campaigns.

### How do we use your personal information?

We ask for your personal information so that we can stay in contact with you and let you know of new campaigns and other opportunities to take part in the fight against modern day slavery.

### When might we give anyone else access to your personal information?

We do not hand our membership lists over to other groups. From time to time we might let you know about an exciting or important campaign being run by a partner organisation in the fight against modern day slavery. When we do this, Walk Free will notify its membership via email or other means but will not hand over member information without consent.

For our campaigns to be effective, it is important that our members and supporters make a public stand in the fight against slavery. So if you participate in specific campaign actions such as adding your name to a petition, uploading a video to our site or writing a letter to a news media organisation, your information will be available publicly on our website. We may also include on our website your comments, along with your first name, last initial, and where you are located (city, state or country).

Like many organisations we use specialist service providers to help run parts of our operations. This means that for us to run our normal operations, service providers such as web hosts and email or SMS providers will sometimes need access to the database we hold on our members. We require them to keep this information confidential.

The exceptional situations when Walk Free might disclose information about you include when it is required by law, when it is necessary for something you have requested from us and when necessary to protect someone’s safety, rights or property.

### Use of our website email tool

In some campaigns, we offer a function in which members can write a message to their head of state, a company CEO, a news organisation or other decision makers. These messages are sent in your name, with your contact information such as your email address as the return address. Please review the content of these messages carefully because as they are sent from your email address and not from Walk Free, you are responsible for the content of these messages.

### How can you stop receiving email from Walk Free?

If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from our email list, you may do so by emailing [info@walkfree.org](mailto:info@walkfree.org) with “unsubscribe” in the subject heading and we will remove your name from our lists. We will act quickly to implement such requests but please note there may be time lags of up to a month to remove names from our database.

### Financial transactions

If you make a financial transaction with Walk Free, your credit card or other payment information will be used only for this transaction through our secure online payment system. Walk Free does not retain payment information without your consent.

### How does Walk Free keep your information secure?

Walk Free endeavours to take all reasonable steps to keep secure any information that we hold about you, and to keep this information accurate and up to date. Your information is transmitted internationally to be stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities. We require our employees and data processors to respect the confidentiality of any personal information.

### What technologies do we use to analyse traffic on the Walk Free website?

Like most websites, we collect basic web traffic information (such as IP addresses) to monitor overall usage of our site. This helps us understand traffic patterns and know if there are problems on the site. We use embedded images in emails to track open rates for our campaigns, so that we can know what campaigns members support most strongly and we can learn better how to keep members of our movement engaged with the fight against modern slavery. We also use URLs (website links) in emails with an identifier that allows us to correctly identify the person who takes an action using a web page, so we can know who are our most active members and what campaigns they support.

Cookie technology is used on several parts of our website. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to a computer, tablet or smartphone to analyse website usage and to facilitate transactions and a more personalised website experience. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. If you do not wish to receive any cookies you may set your browser to refuse cookies. This may mean you will not be able to take full advantage of all the functions on the Walk Free website.

### Children’s privacy

We do not intend to solicit personally identifying information from children. Visitors who are under 13 years of age should ask their parent or guardian for guidance before they enter any personal information on our website.

### Gaining access to your information

If at any time you want to know exactly what personal information Walk Free holds about you, you are welcome to request access to your record by e-mailing us at [info@walkfree.org](mailto:info@walkfree.org). As a standard procedure to protect anybody else gaining access to your personal information, we will ask for some proof of your identity before disclosing this information to you.

### Links to other websites

The Walk Free website contains links to other websites. Walk Free is not responsible for the practices or privacy policies of those sites.

### Future revisions

Walk Free’s website and activities will continue to grow and change as we add new ways to campaign and make your voice heard in the fight against slavery. That means there will be continued changes in how we communicate with our members and run campaigns. Because of this, from time to time, our privacy policy will be reviewed and revised. Whenever we change our privacy policy we will post an updated version on our website, including the last date of revision.

This privacy policy was last revised on 21 May, 2012.
