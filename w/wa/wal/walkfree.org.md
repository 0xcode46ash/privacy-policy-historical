# Privacy Policy and Legal Terms - Walk Free - Walk Free

**INTRODUCTION**

Walk Free (“Walk Free,” “we,” or “us”) values and respects your concerns about privacy. This policy explains how we use, disclose and protect the personal information of people who use our website or otherwise join or support the Walk Free Movement in the ways described below.

Walk Free is a not-for-profit initiative that oversees the Walk Free Movement, including the walkfree.org website, other social media accounts and related databases.

By visiting www.walkfree.org, or by sharing personal information with Walk Free, you are agreeing to and accepting the practices described in this policy, so please review it carefully.

The [walkfree.org](http://www.walkfree.org/) website is maintained by Audacity Factory, a U.S. nonprofit headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, (800) 394-7781.

**WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**

Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.

We generally collect or receive personal information in three ways: (1) you voluntarily provide information to us, such as when you register with or input information into our website, donate to us, sign a petition, or attend one of our events, (2) we collect information automatically, such as through cookies or through use of our website, and (3) other parties, such as social networks, may provide information to us. Each of these methods is described in more detail below.

  1. **Information You Voluntarily Choose to Provide**



The personal information we collect from you will vary depending on the services you are using, the websites you are visiting, and how you access those services and websites. The personal information you provide to us may include your name and contact information. If you choose to make a donation or purchase, we will collect payment card information such as your card’s payment account number and expiration date. Sometimes we ask for your phone number, your postal address, and your billing address.

  2. **Information Collected Automatically When You Use Our Websites**



Like most websites, we collect basic web traffic information (such as IP addresses) to monitor overall usage of our site. This helps us understand traffic patterns and know if there are problems on the site. We use embedded images in emails to track open rates for our campaigns, so that we can learn better how to keep members of our movement engaged with the fight against modern slavery. We also use URLs (website links) in emails with an identifier that allows us to correctly identify the person who takes an action using a web page, so we can know who are our most active members and what initiatives they support.

Cookie technology is used on several parts of our website. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to a computer, tablet or smartphone to analyze website usage and to facilitate transactions and a more personalized website experience. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. If you do not wish to receive any cookies you may set your browser to refuse cookies. This may mean you will not be able to take full advantage of all the functions on the Walk Free website.

  3. **Information We Receive from Others**



In some cases, other parties provide us with personal information about you, or allow us to collect personal information about you. In some cases, we are not able to control the amount or type of information that other parties like social networks, make available to us. Although we cannot control your privacy settings at those websites or how those other parties protect your privacy, once we receive information about you through those websites, we will treat it in accordance with this policy.

**HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?**

As a general matter, Walk Free uses your personal information to provide the services or information you request. We also may use your personal information to:

  * stay in contact with you, let you know of new opportunities to take part in the fight against modern slavery, and provide you with updates and information;
  * better understand our users, their interests, and their preferences;
  * develop, deliver, and improve our services and other offerings; and
  * for internal purposes such as auditing and data analysis.



We also collect information in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.

**WHEN MIGHT WE GIVE ANYONE ELSE ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?**

Walk Free will not disclose your personal information to any third parties except:

  * to our related companies;


  * to third parties appointed by Walk Free to provide services on our behalf, including, without limitation, our contractors, website and data hosting providers, email or SMS providers, technology service providers, advertising partners, campaign partners and other persons who perform services for us – in which case, Walk Free uses reasonable steps to ensure such third parties keep your personal information confidential and do not use or disclose your personal information for any purpose other than the purpose of providing those services to us;
  * to our professional advisers, accountants, insurers, lawyers and auditors on a confidential basis;
  * if Walk Free or its assets are or may be acquired by a third party, the information may be provided to that third party and its advisors;
  * in exceptional circumstances, Walk Free may be required or permitted by law to disclose personal information, for example when it is necessary for something you have requested from us and when necessary to protect someone’s safety, rights or property; or
  * otherwise with your consent.



Except as set forth above, we do not provide your personal information to other groups. From time to time we might let you know about an exciting or important campaign being run by a partner organisation in the fight against modern day slavery. When we do this, Walk Free will let you know, and will not disclose any of your personal information to such an organisation without your consent and without securing a suitable written agreement with the other organisation for the proper use of this information.

For our campaigns to be effective, it is important that our members and supporters make a public stand in the fight against slavery. So if you participate in specific campaign actions such as adding your name to a petition, uploading a video to our site or writing a letter to a news media organisation, your information will be available publicly on our website. We may also include on our website your comments, along with your first name, last initial, and where you are located (city, state or country).

As part of our international operations, we may transfer information about you to any jurisdiction where we operate or do business. If you are an EU resident, we will transfer your personal information for the above purposes to our subsidiaries, affiliates, and service providers that may be located outside of the EU. The laws in those jurisdictions may not necessarily provide the same level of data protection compared to the laws in your country. However, we will treat your personal information as subject to the protections described in this policy. When you use our websites or services, you acknowledge that we may transfer information about you as described in this policy.

**USE OF OUR WEBSITE EMAIL TOOL**

In some campaigns, we offer a function in which members can write a message to their head of state, a company CEO, a news organisation or other decision makers. These messages are sent in your name, with your contact information such as your email address as the return address. Please review the content of these messages carefully because as they are sent from your email address and not from Walk Free, you are responsible for the content of these messages.

**HOW CAN YOU STOP RECEIVING EMAIL FROM WALK FREE?**

If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from our email list, you may do so by clicking on the Unsubscribe link included in each of our emails or by emailing [info@walkfree.org](mailto:info@walkfree.org) with “unsubscribe” in the subject heading and we will remove your name from our lists. We will act quickly to implement such requests but please note there may be time lags of up to a month to remove names from our database.

If you would like to verify, update or change the contact information we have received from you, please email [info@walkfree.org](mailto:info@walkfree.org).

**FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS**

If you make a financial transaction with Walk Free, your credit card or other payment information will be used only for this transaction through our secure online payment system. Walk Free does not retain payment information without your consent.

**HOW DOES WALK FREE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SECURE?**

Walk Free endeavours to take all reasonable steps to keep secure any information that we hold about you, and to keep this information accurate and up to date. Your information is transmitted internationally to be stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities. We require our employees and data processors to respect the confidentiality of any personal information.

**CHILDREN’S PRIVACY**

We do not direct our websites or services to children (usually considered to be under the age of 13, depending on the country where you reside). We also do not intentionally collect personal information from children through our websites or applications. If you are the parent or guardian of a child and you believe that we have inadvertently received personal information about that child, please contact us as described in the Contacting Us section of this policy and we will delete the information from our records.

**GAINING ACCESS TO YOUR INFORMATION**

If at any time you want to know exactly what personal information Walk Free holds about you, you are welcome to request access to your record by e-mailing us at [info@walkfree.org](mailto:info@walkfree.org). As a standard procedure to protect against unauthorized access to your personal information, we will ask for some proof of your identity before disclosing this information to you.

**LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES**

The Walk Free website contains links to other websites. Walk Free is not responsible for the practices or privacy policies of those sites.

**FUTURE REVISIONS**

Walk Free’s website and activities will continue to grow and change as we add new ways to campaign and make your voice heard in the fight against slavery. That means there will be continued changes in how we communicate with our members and run campaigns. Because of this, from time to time, our privacy policy will be reviewed and revised. Whenever we change our privacy policy we will post an updated version on our website, including the last date of revision.

This privacy policy was last revised on 17 February 2016.

**CONTACTING US**
