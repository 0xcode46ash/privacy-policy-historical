# Privacy Policy - Walk Free Foundation

INTRODUCTION

The Walk Free Foundation is a not-for-profit initiative that oversees the walkfreefoundation.org website. This policy explains how we use, disclose and protect the personal information of people who use our website or otherwise join or support the Walk Free Foundation in the ways described below. The Walk Free Foundation values and respects the privacy of our members.

WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

In order to use the Walk Free Foundation site, we may require information from you in order to provide the best service possible. All correspondence, including by email, may also be collected and stored, particularly in regard to donations.

HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

The Walk Free Foundation collects, holds, uses and discloses personal information where necessary for its operation, including staying in contact with you and letting you know of opportunities to take part in the fight against modern slavery, as well as for any secondary purpose that is reasonably related to this primary purpose. The Walk Free Foundation may also hold, use or disclose your personal information where you have expressly or implicitly consented to the holding, use or disclosure, or where the holding, use or disclosure is authorised or required by law. If the Walk Free Foundation wishes to hold, use or disclose your personal information in other circumstances, we will obtain your prior consent to do so. Further information about this is provided in the remainder of this policy.

WHEN MIGHT WE GIVE ANYONE ELSE ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

The Walk Free Foundation will not disclose your personal information to any third parties except: to our related companies, but only in exceptional circumstances; to third parties appointed by the Walk Free Foundation, including our contractors, website and data hosting providers, email or SMS providers, technology service providers, advertising partners, campaign partners and other persons who perform services for us – in which case, the Walk Free Foundation uses reasonable steps to ensure such third parties keep your personal information confidential and do not use or disclose your personal information for any purpose other than the purpose of providing those services to us; to our professional advisers, accountants, insurers, lawyers and auditors on a confidential basis; if the Walk Free Foundation or its assets are or may be acquired by a third party, the information may be provided to that third party and its advisors;

in exceptional circumstances, the Walk Free Foundation may be required or permitted by law to disclose personal information, for example when it is necessary for something you have requested from us and when necessary to protect someone’s safety, rights or property; or otherwise with your consent.

We do not hand our membership lists over to other groups. From time to time we might let you know about an exciting or important campaign being run by a partner organisation in the fight against modern day slavery. When we do this, the Walk Free Foundation will let you know, and will not hand over member information without consent and without securing a suitable written agreement with the other organisation for the proper use of this information.

The Walk Free Foundation may disclose your personal information to third parties located outside of the country in which your personal information is collected, if it is reasonably necessary for the Walk Free Foundation. The Walk Free Foundation will take reasonable steps to ensure that any foreign recipient protects your personal information in the manner provided in this policy. By providing the Walk Free Foundation with personal information, you consent to us disclosing personal information to a foreign recipient.

HOW CAN YOU STOP RECEIVING EMAIL FROM THE WALK FREE FOUNDATION?

If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from our email list, you may do so by clicking on the Unsubscribe link included in each of our emails or by emailing media@walkfreefoundation.org with “unsubscribe” in the subject heading and we will remove your name from our lists. We will act quickly to implement such requests but please note there may be time lags of up to a month to remove names from our database.

FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS

If you make a financial transaction with the Walk Free Foundation, your credit card or other payment information will be used only for this transaction through our secure online payment system. The Walk Free Foundation does not retain payment information without your consent.
