### Personal Information Privacy

The term “personal information” is used to describe the information that can be used to identify, contact, or locate a single person or can be used with other sources to uniquely identify a single individual.

We will not share your personal information with third parties unless we believe in good faith that:

(I) such information is permitted being subject to access, use, preservation or disclosure to reasonably and necessarily satisfy any applicable law, regulation or legal process.

(II) such action is appropriate to enforce the Terms of Use for the Service.

(III) such action assists in detecting, preventing and, vice versa, addressing fraud, security or technical issues associated with the Service.

(IV) such action is appropriate to protect the rights and property as well as encourage safety of Paymentwall, its employees, users of the Service and others.

Customers may prevent their information from being used by other services by e-mailing or mailing PW Inc. a letter to the address below. We respect each request and will provide site visitors a description of information that we maintain about them.

### Protection of your Personal Information

PW Inc. has taken appropriate physical, electronic, and procedural security measures to protect against loss, misuse or alteration of the information that we have collected from you at our site or through the Service.

### How We Use Cookies

Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information. Cookies are small data files used to recognize PW Inc. users, to store user preferences, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, record past activity at a site to provide better service when visitors return to our site, help prevent fraud, and to provide trust and safety. Browser settings can be changed to alert you of accepting cookies and will prompt you to accept a cookie or it can disallow cookies. If cookies are disallowed, you may have limited access to Paymentwall’s Services.

### Payments Safety and Security

Paymentwall’s goal is to provide you with a safe and convenient online checkout experience. We always protect the security of your information by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology for each transmission that encrypts the information you input. All purchases made via a credit card or alternative direct payment must use an SSL-enabled browser. Using SSL-enabled browsers better protect the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it is being transmitted over the Internet. When you enter sensitive information (such as e-wallet account details, mobile number, credit card number or your password) and place an order online, we encrypt that information using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology that is the approved industry standard.

Users can check the security of their internet connection by looking at address bar of your browser window as you place your order online. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock, then the SSL is active and the server is secure. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https". For credit card transactions, we will securely transmit the entire credit card number to be processed by the credit card company. We will only reveal the last 4 digits of your credit card number when printing an order confirmation. For security purposes we do not keep or store your credit card information as it is only used to complete the secure transaction. Your credit card number and other sensitive information will not be stored after the transaction is complete to help protect your credit card information. To further protect against unauthorized access to your account and to your computer, be sure to sign off when finished.

### Unsolicited e-mails

PW Inc. does not send unsolicited e-mails to private addresses or to anyone who has asked to remove from all PW Inc. email lists. Any newsletters that we send are only sent to those who have subscribed to them. To stop receiving e-mails or newsletters from Paymentwall, click on the unsubscribe link in the e-mail or newsletter.
