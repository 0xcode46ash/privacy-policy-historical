## Information Collected and How it is Used

If you do nothing during your visit to our website but browse, read pages or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit. This information does not identify you personally. We automatically collect and store the following information about your visit: 

  1. The Internet Protocol address and domain name used. The Internet Protocol address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet service provider or directly to your computer. We use the Internet Protocol address to direct Internet traffic to you. This address can be translated to determine the domain name of your service provider (e.g. xcompany.com or yourschool.edu).
  2. The type of browser and operating system you used.
  3. The date and time you visited this site.
  4. The Web pages or services you accessed at this site.



The information we automatically collect or store is logged by Cole & Weber and is used by Washington's Lottery to improve the content of our Web services and to help us understand how people are using our services. The Lottery analyzes this information to determine how our website is being used, so that we may continually improve the site's usefulness to the public.

## What we collect if you volunteer information. 

If during your visit to our website you participate in a survey, send an email, or perform some other transaction online, the following additional information will be collected: 

  1. The email address and contents of the email, for those who communicate with us via email.
  2. Information volunteered in response to a survey.
  3. Information volunteered through an online form for any other purpose.



We use your email to respond appropriately. This may be to respond to you, to address issues you may identify, to further improve our website, or to forward the email to another agency for appropriate action. Survey information is used to formulate Lottery player demographics and player preferences.

## Personal Information and Choice

You may choose whether to provide personal information online.  
"Personal information" is information about a natural person that is readily identifiable with that specific individual. Personal information includes such things as an individual's name, address, and phone number. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not considered personal information. 

We collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us by sending us email, participating in a survey, or completing an online form. You may choose not to contact us by email, participate in a survey or to provide any personal information using an online form. Your choice to not participate in these activities will not impair your ability to browse the Washington's Lottery website and read or download any information provided on the site. 

If personal information is requested on the website or volunteered by the user, state law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information is a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by federal or state law. If you believe that your personal information is being used for a purpose other than what was intended when submitted, you may contact Washington's Lottery Legal Services as shown in the Contact Us section of this web site. 

Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information requested from or volunteered by children online or by email will be treated the same way as information given by an adult, and may be subject to public access.

## Review of Certain [Personal/Private] Information Use
