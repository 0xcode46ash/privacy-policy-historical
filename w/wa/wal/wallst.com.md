# Privacy and Cookie Policy

Markit is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy applies to the personal information we collect on this website and the personal information we handle about the individual representatives (which term may include, without limitation, employees, officers or contractors) of our subscribers. 

In addition, this privacy policy describes the type of information we gather and track, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared. 

In general, you can visit Markit on the internet without disclosing who you are or giving any personal information about yourself. There are times, however, when Markit may need information from you to better serve you. 

**1\. Collection and Use of Personal Information**

Markit collects personal information that you voluntarily provide on this website, which may include your name, address, e-mail address, and other contact information. For example, Markit collects personal information when you register to receive more information about certain Markit services or products and or when you submit the information in order to receive support for Markit services or products to which you subscribe. Markit uses this information to communicate with you and to provide you with your requested information or support. 

If you are a representative of one of our subscribers, we may have received personal information about you from the subscriber (such as your name, work title and contact information). You also may provide us with your personal information directly in connection with your use of our offerings. This may include additional contact information, your date of birth, a copy of your passport (required by “know your customer” regulations), and payment information. 

Markit primarily uses the personal information it collects to provide you with: (a) the services and data to which you are entitled; and (b) other information which you have requested. We also may use this personal information when analyzing and improving our services. 

If you do not wish to provide such personal information to us, you are not obligated to, but as a result you may not be able to use our website or services. Some of the personal information we request from you is optional. This means that you can elect not to provide it to us and you still will be able to use our website or services. In most cases, we identify required personal information to you by displaying an asterisk (*) next to the field where we request the required personal information. 

Markit may also provide you with information about our products and services. You may instruct Markit at any time not to use your personal information for this purpose by sending an email to [informationcompliance@markit.com](mailto:informationcompliance@markit.com). 

A “tell-a-friend” or other similar sharing tool provided on our website and/or in our e-mails allows you to send information about our products and offerings to another person. When you use these tools, we may ask you for the name and information of the other person. That information will be covered by this privacy policy. We will use it only to send the communication to your friend and for no other purpose.
