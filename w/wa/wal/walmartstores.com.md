# Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. - Security & Privacy

### Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Privacy Policy for Customers and Members

One of Wal-Mart's Three Core Basic Beliefs is "Respect for the Individual."  
Accordingly, we (Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and our Affiliates -- Sam's Club, Walmart.com, Samsclub.com, and any other companies in which we have a majority ownership interest) will collect and use personal information of customers and members only as follows:

### Our purpose in collecting personal information.

Personal information means information about you which is, or can be, tied to you as an individual.

We collect personal information to:

  * deliver the products and services you want;
  * administer our businesses;
  * develop and communicate special offers;
  * provide customer service; and
  * respond to legal process (such as subpoenas and warrants).



### What information we collect and how we collect it.

The information we collect may include:

  * contact information, identification numbers, account numbers, product preferences, and other information you provide when you do business with us, either online, in our stores, or at our membership warehouse clubs, or sign up for certain services, such as a gift registry or personalized website account;
  * technical information (such as your Internet Protocol address, your computer's operating system and browser type, and the address of a referring website, if any, and the path you take through our web pages) when you visit our websites; and
  * financial and health care information provided by you and third parties (such as credit bureaus, health care providers, insurers, etc.) in connection with your transactions.



When you visit our websites, we may place a "cookie," a small computer file, on your computer to help us recognize and serve you better when you return. You may delete this cookie from your computer. You may also set your Internet browser to reject cookies, however, doing so may limit the functionality of our websites.

At some stores and clubs we may record your presence on security monitors for safety and security purposes.

### How we use personal information.

We do not sell or rent personal information to others.

We do not use cookies to track movements on websites other than our own.

We do not disclose personal information to non-Affiliates except in the following situations:

  * when you request or give us permission to do so;
  * when we use service providers and contractors (such as credit card issuers, check cashing bureaus, or data processors, mailing and fulfillment houses, customer service or research companies, etc.) for limited purposes to assist us in completing our transactions with you, maintaining or conducting our business, or doing customer research;
  * when appropriate to prevent harm or injury (such as for product recalls, preventing fraud, or handling claims or other liabilities), or to comply with valid legal process and applicable laws.
  * When we authorize select third parties to contact you, so that you may be considered about offers for goods and services that may be offered or endorsed by Wal-Mart, including Wal-Mart credit cards and debit cards.



We may share information with Affiliates for these same reasons and also to let you know about special offers, new products and services, Rollbacks, and other great values, unless such sharing is prohibited by law. We may share with Affiliates and non-Affiliates statistical information that does not identify you individually.

### We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information.

Personal information that we maintain is subject to physical, administrative, and technical controls. When we do have to collect your most sensitive personal information, such as Social Security Numbers, we will protect its confidentiality, prohibit its unlawful disclosure, and limit access to authorized personnel only. 

### Health care and international data.

  * Health care information: In addition to the policies discussed above, we have more detailed information about how we handle your health care information in our Notices of Health Care Information Privacy Practices. Wal-Mart has a separate Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Policy that is available by contacting the addresses listed below.
  * International customers and members: If you provided information to us from a country other than the United States, your information may be transmitted to, and processed by us or our service providers in the United States or other countries other than your own. If you provided information from a country that grants specific additional privacy rights, contact us at the addresses listed below to exercise your rights.



### Modifications to our privacy policies.

We reserve the right to change our privacy policies at any time, except as may be prohibited by law. We will post revisions online and in locations in our stores and clubs that we consider appropriate.
