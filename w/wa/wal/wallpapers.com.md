**FREEZE.COM, LLC  
PRIVACY POLICY** __

Freeze.com, LLC and its subsidiary company, Freeze Media, LLC (collectively “Freeze”) are committed to safeguarding your privacy online and respects the privacy of its customers and the users of this website and the services provided by Freeze.  This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) discloses how we collect and use information, and the choices that you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

In addition to the many services that Freeze provides throughout the Freeze network of affiliated companies, Freeze delivers advertisements, promotions and offers by e-mail and through its screensavers to its members and subscribers who have opted-in to receive such messages, either directly through Freeze, or through one of our partners or affiliates (the “Service”).  Freeze is committed to providing you with relevant and timely offers catered to your specific interests that you want to receive, in addition to allowing us to continue to provide you with the latest in screensaver, wallpaper and desktop enhancement technology. 

Freeze is dedicated to following only responsible and ethical e-mail practices.  Freeze takes an aggressive stance against unsolicited commercial e-mail and is continually updating its policies and procedures to comply with the Can-Spam Act of 2003.   In that regard, we know that just because you opted-in to receive Freeze messages or downloaded a screensaver, you may want to discontinue future e-mail offers and promotions from Freeze.  You can remove yourself from any or all of our lists and offers at any time by following the simple instructions at [support.freeze.com](http://support.freeze.com/).  Additionally, every e-mail that Freeze sends to its members and subscribers contains a working unsubscribe link prominently displayed at the bottom of each e-mail.  By clicking on such link, you will be automatically removed from future Freeze offers and promotions.  Lastly, if a Freeze advertiser provides Freeze a link to the advertiser’s internal e-mail suppression list, Freeze will provide this link to you with our offer delivery so that you may choose to remove yourself from a specific offer.  ****

Freeze is committed to making your use of [www.freeze.com](http://www.freeze.com/), [www.wallpapers.com](http://www.wallpapers.com/)  and [www.screensaver.com](http://www.screensaver.com/) (collectively the “Site”) as easy and enjoyable as possible.  Please take a moment to read the following Privacy Policy to determine how you personal information will be treated as you make full use of our many offerings.  By using the Site and/or the Service, or providing the information requested by the Site and/or Service, or by continuing to use the Site and/or Service after having an opportunity to review this Privacy Policy, you agree to accept the terms of our Privacy Policy and Freeze’s use of the information it collects.  If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site or participate in the Service.

Freeze reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time without giving you prior notice.  Your use of the Site or the Service following any such modification constitutes your agreement to be bound by this Privacy Policy as modified.  The last date this Privacy Policy was revised or modified is set forth below (“Effective Date”).

**I.   What personally identifiable information does Freeze collect from me?**

Freeze collects information in several ways from affiliates and different parts of our network of web sites. Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, Freeze will require your e-mail address in order to use the Service.  Freeze will also require your name, date of birth, zip code, country and gender in order to provide the Service, although this information may not necessarily be collected by Freeze upon completion of the registration process.  Additionally, Freeze may request, but does not require, your credit card number and/or social security number, as well as personal interests in order to better provide the Service.  The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience and the Service that you receive.  As always, you can simply view the Site without registering for a membership or subscribing to portions of the Service without being required to provide any personal information, except that which is necessary to accommodate your request. ****

In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times, including, but not limited to, when you request access to our entertainment or computer utilities offerings, etc., or agree to download our content for your use. If you contact Freeze, we may keep a record of that correspondence. Freeze also occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for both research purposes and to provide the Service. Wherever Freeze collects personal information, we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that specified page.

**II.   What are cookies and how does Freeze use them?**

As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, Freeze uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you.  A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Any Site which asks you to log-in or that are customizable require that you accept cookies. (See " _What are my choices regarding collection, use and distribution of my information?_ " for more information on cookies.)

Generally, Freeze uses cookies to:

(1) Remind us of who you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or "Login" and is modified when you “Customize” or "Logout” of our services. Freeze also uses cookies to store your zip code and other information you have submitted for other services, such as displaying your local weather.

(2) Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing Freeze is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user, and to help target advertisements based on user interests and behavior.

(3) Assist affiliates and merchants associated with Freeze to track visits to and business at their sites and stores, and to process the items in your shopping basket. This information collected by cookies is sometimes called "clickstream" or "click trail" and may also describe which pages you have seen in each merchant's store.

(4) Measure certain traffic patterns, for example areas of Freeze's network of Sites you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our users' habits are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new experience on a Freeze Site a better one. We may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on our sites.

Advertisers that serve ads onto Freeze may also use their own cookies. 

Freeze also collects IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. In addition, Freeze Mail includes IP addresses in outgoing mail message headers. ****

**III.   How does Freeze use my information?**

Freeze's primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our network of Sites and through our partners. This includes personalization services, interactive communications, online shopping and many other types of services, most of which are completely free to you. In order to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements and encourage your participation in opt-in mailings. By knowing a little about you, Freeze is able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you.

In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, Freeze plays the middleman. Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old). Freeze takes the advertisement and displays it to users meeting that criteria. In this process, the advertiser never has access to individual user information. In other cases, this information may be shared with Freeze's affiliates and trusted partners in order to deliver advertisements and e-mail offers. This kind of advertisement targeting is done with banner ads as well as promotional email through Freeze, its affiliates and trusted business partners. You will only receive special offers via email from Freeze, its affiliates and trusted business partners if you have indicated in your account preferences, or at some other time, that you would like to receive them. 

Freeze does research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, during a promotion, from our server log files or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. Freeze may share this aggregated data with advertisers or business partners.

As Freeze develops, we may buy other businesses or their assets or sell our business assets.  Customer information is generally one of the business assets involved in such transactions.  Thus, in the event that Freeze or all of its assets are acquired, customer information, including any visitor information collected through the Site or the Service, would be one of the transferred assets.

Freeze reserves the right to disclose collected information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contract or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Freeze’s rights or property, other visitors, subscribers, members or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.  Freeze also reserves the right to disclose visitor, member or subscriber information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

**IV.   Who is collecting information?**

When you are on a Site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Freeze alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy or in an offer form or registration form that you may be asked to complete as part of utilizing the Service.  For example, certain information like name, e-mail address, and address, as well as your responses to survey questions, may be shared with affiliates and trusted business partners to better provide the Service and to provide you with timely e-mail offers or products that interest you. Additionally, some Services, like Freeze Wireless, are offered in conjunction with a partner company. In order to provide this co-branded service to you, it is necessary for us to share your personal information with our partner company. ****

Promotions that run on Freeze may be sponsored by companies other than Freeze or may be co-sponsored by Freeze and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor of that promotion. 

Please be aware that Freeze partners, sponsors advertisers, and web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those Internet access partners, advertisers, and web sites linked from Freeze are not covered by this Privacy Policy.  Freeze has no liability or responsibility for these independent policies or the use of any personally identifiable information transferred to trusted business partners.

**V.   With whom does Freeze share my information?**

Except as otherwise set forth in the Privacy Policy, Freeze will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when you have decided to opt-in to receive information, we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described in this Privacy Policy.

**VI.        What are my choices regarding collections, use and distribution of my information?**

Freeze may, from time to time, send you email regarding third party promotions, and our, as well as other, products and services.  In addition, if you indicated upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from Freeze and our partners, we may occasionally send you direct postal mail about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. Only Freeze (or agents and affiliates working on behalf of Freeze and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct postal mailings and only if you indicated that you do not object to these offers.

You will need your initial registration information including postal address and email address.

When you participate in these types of promotions, you automatically receive promotion-related email from Freeze, its affiliates and business partners, unless you choose the no-email option that some promotions offer. Occasionally these promotion-related email messages may include targeted advertisements.

This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet café.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Freeze cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk.
