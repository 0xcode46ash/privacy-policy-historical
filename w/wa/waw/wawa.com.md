# Wawa - Privacy Policy

Wawa takes your privacy seriously. When you order Cool Merchandise from Wawa, your personal information will be used only for the processing of that order. It will not be used for any other purpose without your permission.

### Wawa Official Privacy Policy

Protecting your privacy is important to Wawa. We hope the following policy will help you understand how Wawa collects, uses, and safeguards the personal information you provide on our website.

### Information Collection 

If you browse Wawa's website, you do so anonymously. We don't collect personal information, including your email address. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which parts of our website you visit and how long you spend there. But we do not link your IP address to anything personally identifiable. The only other information automatically provided to us is the type of computer and operating system you are using. Your browser supplies us with this information. 

At times we may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal information, such as your email address and postal address, for purposes such as corresponding with us, registering at a site, or participating in an online survey. 

### Information Use

If you provide us with your email or postal address, or have done so in the past, we will ask you if we can use it to send you updates on the latest Wawa news. If you do not want us to contact you, you can choose to "opt out," and Wawa will respect your wishes. 

We may use information that you have given us to learn more about our customers so that we can develop better products and services. We may also use the information to inform you about new products, services, and offers that may be of interest to you. These offers may be based on information you provided in your initial transaction with us or in surveys.

Wawa does not share your profile with anyone else outside of Wawa without your consent, and no one else can access your information. 

### Data Security

Wawa is fully committed to data security. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information you provide to us online. However, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit to us. In this regard, we urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data while you are on the Internet. At a minimum, we encourage you to make sure that you are using a secure browser as you surf the Internet.
