Your IP address is logged to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the site.  WagerLine.com uses cookies to save login information so you don’t have to enter it each time you visit.   It also uses cookies to estimate the number of repeat visitors. WagerLine.com’s registration form requires users to provide contact information (like their name and email address).  This information is used to verify eligibility of contest winners, and to contact you if you win a prize.  We may also periodically use this information to send you promotional material regarding WagerLine.com or our advertisers.

Links 

WagerLine.com contains links to other sites.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of the sites that we link.

Message Boards 

WagerLine.com makes message boards available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information.

Messages containing profanity, slander, libel, hatred, or obscenity are not allowed. We reserve the right to remove messages, posting rights, or user accounts at any time if this policy is not followed. Once posting rights are removed, they are not reinstated.

Free advertisements are not allowed on our message boards for two reasons: their presence is unfair to our paying advertisers, and they often attempt to promote companies that are not reputable. Therefore, if a non-paying advertiser uses the message boards to advertise their product, service, or web site; the message will be deleted and the author will permanently lose their posting rights.

Wagerline cannot and will not be held liable for the contents nor the effects of messages. The author of a post assumes all responsibility for its contents, without limits.
