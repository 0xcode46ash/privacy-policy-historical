WageWorks is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.  We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.  WageWorks collects information from our users at several different points on our website. 

In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration/employee profile form.  During registration a user is required to give their contact information such as name, email address, date of birth, home or business address.  This information is used to fulfill product orders and to contact the user if s/he has problems.  WageWorks cannot process a user’s order without the registration information or allow access to the secure portion of the website, as we need to verify status and eligibility.  It is optional for the user to provide demographic information, but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience using our services. 

We request information from the user on order forms.  To make an order or benefit election, the user must have logon access to our site, and must have provided contact information (like name and shipping address) and possibly financial information (like credit card number, expiration date).  This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders.  If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. 

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user.  We do not currently use cookies on our site. 

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

  


We will share aggregated information with our partners such as purchase trends and demographic data.  This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

We use outside companies to ship products to a user’s home or office.  These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

We partner with other parties to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.  These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. 

This website contains links to other sites. Please be advised that WAGEWORKS is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Website. 

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys.  Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user also has a choice to fill out the survey anonymously.  Information requested may concern WageWorks processes, website usage, planned purchases and requested features.  Contact information will be used to verify the validity of the input.  Survey information will be used for the purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this WageWorks website or for future product development. 

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing others about our site, we ask them for a contact name and email address.  WAGEWORKS will choose whether to send the contact person information about our company and services.  The person named in the referral may contact WAGEWORKS at [info@wageworks.com](mailto:info@wageworks.com) to request the removal of their information from our database. 

  


This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information.  When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.

When our registration/profile asks users to enter sensitive information such as date of birth, home address and social security number, that information is encrypted using SSL.  During this process, the user creates a username and password that establishes their account.  Once the account is established, users must log on to update their profile, place orders or review account status – all of which are done on secure pages.  While on a secure page, such as the registration or ‘MyAccount’ page, the icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer will show a ‘locked’ status.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.  All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific function – such as customer support - are granted access to personally identifiable information.  Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk.  When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to any applications.

All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected.  Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [info@wageworks.com](mailto:info@wageworks.com).

We send all new members a confirming email to verify user information and purchases.  Established members may periodically receive information on products, services, special deals, and other related information.  Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option of not receiving these types of communications.  Please see our opt-in statement below. 

If a user’s personally identifiable information changes such as the delivery address, we provide a way to correct, update or remove personal data that is provided to us.  This can be done at the Employee profile section of the website, via email to [info@wageworks.com](mailto:info@wageworks.com) or by calling 877-WageWorks.  User’s personal information can also be updated based upon data provided to WageWorks from their employer. 

  


Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-in’ to have their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information.  For example, we periodically will offer to provide sales materials and information to users of our products.

Users who no longer wish to receive our correspondence or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line of the email or by emailing us at [info@wageworks.com](mailto:info@wageworks.com). 

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we would notify users by way of an email.  Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.  We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
