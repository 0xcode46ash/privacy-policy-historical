# Privacy Policy

**Copyright:** Wagerweb Privacy Policy-Standards-Codes document is based on the copyrighted Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information, CAN/CSA-Q830-95, produced by the Canadian Standards Association.

**Definitions**

  1. **Collection** The word, collection, refers to the act of gathering, acquiring, or obtaining personal information from any source, including third parties, by any means.
  2. **Consent** The word, consent, refers to voluntary agreement with what is being done or proposed. Consent can be either express, or implied. Express consent is given explicitly, either orally, or in writing. Express consent is unequivocal and does not require any inference on the part of the organization seeking consent. Implied consent arises where consent may reasonably be inferred from the action, or inaction, of the individual.
  3. **Disclosure** The word, disclosure, refers to making personal information available to others outside the organization.
  4. **Organization** The word, organization, refers to [WagerWeb](https://web.archive.org/) and associations, businesses, charitable organizations, clubs, government bodies, institutions, professional practices, and unions. **Personal Information** The term, personal information, refers to any record, in any form that identifies an individual client, affiliate or employee. This definition does not include aggregated information, which cannot be associated with a specific person.
  5. **Use** The word, use, refers to the treatment and handling of personal information by, and within, Wagerweb.



**Rationale**

  1. Wagerweb recognizes that it is part of an extensive, highly active, and rapidly expanding, Internet community, within which masses of information and data are created, collected, acquired, processed, and exchanged with incredible speed.
  2. Wagerweb also recognizes that the advanced technology, that makes these actions possible, has to be viewed from two critical perspectives. On the one hand, the technology provides a number of benefits which improve the quality of our lives. At the same time, it gives rise to concerns about the protection of the individual’s rights, and his/her right to control the use and exchange of personal information.
  3. Wagerweb is sensitive to these points of view, and the need to be responsible and accountable to our clients, affiliates and employees for any, and all, expressions of trust entered into by them. We know we have to balance our need for certain personal information with the rights of our clients, affiliates and employees, and their desire for a certain measure of privacy i.e., anonymity.
  4. We also believe we have a responsibility to materially demonstrate our commitment to the protection of private information in concrete and transparent terms.



As a direct result of our commitment and our rationale, Wager Web has made a corporate commitment to the following principles relating to the protection of personal information. The principles are covered, first of all, in a brief version, in the following order:
