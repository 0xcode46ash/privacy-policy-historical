The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web pages, to notify customers about updates to our Web site, to improve our products, to contact customers for marketing purposes, and to receive feedback from customers about the products we publish and related course and market information. It is not shared with other organizations. 

For each visitor to our Web pages, our Web server automatically recognizes the consumer's domain name. In general, we collect only the domain name, not the e-mail address of visitors to our web pages. However, we do collect e-mail addresses when messages are posted to our bulletin board, when postings are made to our chat areas, when e-mail addresses are volunteered on our subscription page, survey pages and/or site registrations, and when customers communicate with us via e-mail. 

If you supply us with your e-mail address on-line you may receive periodic e-mail from us with information on new products and services. If you receive e-mail communication from us and do not want to continue receiving it in the future, please let us know by contacting us via e-mail, phone, or mail, or by going to the mailing list section of our web site and checking the "Please remove me from your e-mail list" box. Please provide us with your exact name and e-mail address. 

If you want to participate in one of our chat rooms, you will be asked to register. On the registration page, you have the option of entering your e-mail address or leaving it blank. If you do enter your e-mail address, other members of the chat room will be able to view your address by looking up your "business card" (business cards are created automatically when a person registers). If you do not want other members of the chat room to have access to your e-mail address or other optional information, do not enter it when you register. 

If you supply us with your postal address on-line you may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please let us know by contacting us via e-mail, phone or mail. Please provide us with your exact name and address. 

Persons who supply us with their telephone numbers on-line may receive telephone contact from us with information regarding orders they have placed on-line. They also may receive telephone contact from us with information regarding new products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such telephone calls, please let us know by contacting us via e-mail, phone or mail.
