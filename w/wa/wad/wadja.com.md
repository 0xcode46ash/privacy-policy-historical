# Wadja: Privacy policy

Effective: March 4, 2007

**About Wadja.com**

Wadja.com is an online service that allows our members to set up unique personal mobile profiles that can be linked together through networks of friends. Wadja members can view each others' profiles, communicate with old friends and meet new friends on the service, share photos, post comments, and describe their interests. To enrich our members' experience, we request and display some personal information to other members and visitors, which allows our users to identify each other and expand their network of friends. Wadja members can change their profile information at any time and can control how other members and the service communicates with them.

Wadja.com cares deeply about online privacy.  If you have any questions concerning this privacy policy, please email us at [privacy@wadja.com.](mailto:privacy@wadja.com)

**Information Collection and Use by Wadja.com**

Wadja.com collects user submitted information such as name, email address, and age to authenticate users and to send notifications to those users relating to the Wadja.com service. Wadja.com also collects other profile data including but not limited to: personal interests, gender, age, mobile number and location in order to assist users in finding and communicating with each other.

Wadja.com also logs non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from users and visitors to the site. This data is used to manage the website, track usage and improve the website services. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to members. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.

User Profile information including members' pictures and first names are displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction in the Wadja.com social networking community. Email addresses and mobile numbers are used for the purposes of inviting new friends to join Wadja, to add users to members' friends' networks, and to send notifications related to the service. With the exception of inviting friends, adding friends, and notifications, a user's email address is not shared or displayed to people within a user's personal network.

Many of Wadja's services work with SMS messaging. You can send a free text (sms) message to anyone who is on your friends list and has added their phone number to their details page. Like wise Wadja provides a messaging service through SMS Gateway providers that allow registered Wadja users to send a set amount of SMS messages to friends not registered within the Wadja network. This requires registered Wadja users to input the mobile country code, network operator and the number of the message recipient.

This service is strictly offered to Wadja members and as a Graphical User Interface between the web and Gateway Provider. Wadja has capped this service to Wadja users and therefore limits the amount of outside friend messages a user can send. Wadja provides this interface to all users who have verified their email account and in no way assumes any responsibility for the actions of individual users and their messaging habits. Any reports of abuse will result in Wadja discontinuing user’s accounts without any notification whatsoever. Each user takes FULL RESPONSIBILITY for the destination and content of each and every message they send through the Wadja GUI web interface.

Wadja's SMS messaging service is strictly optional and Wadja is in no way liable or responsible for any misrepresentation or misuse of mobile phone numbers or wrong mobile numbers. Wadja will never use our SMS messaging service for SMS spamming or telemarketing, however since the service is ad supported, Wadja reserves the right to place a small sponsored text ad from select advertisers, of no more than 60 characters long, on the footer of each SMS message sent through the Wadja.com site; including alerts and private messaging between friends in and outside of the network. Any user sending SMS messages through the Wadja GUI interface understands that they are responsible, as senders, for any complaints or disputes that a recipient may have with the advertisements that accompany the message. Wadja users do not have to use the free service and understand that ad supported messaging provides them with free message sending rights and is marked with ">" character for recipient clarification.

Keep in mind that you can make your mobile number invisible to your friends list, but still receive messages, since your friends only see your Wadja ID as a 'Send to' option in their SMS contact list. Your mobile number will only be available to your friends in your network. Wadja assumes no responsibility, nor is legally liable for any damage, whether personal or professional, for any late delivery or failed delivery of SMS messages.

Should you decide to display your mobile phone number to your friends list, Wadja is in no way legally liable or responsible for any misuse or abuse of your displayed mobile phone number. You always have the choice to make your mobile number invisible to your friends list by un-checking "Make my mobile number visible to my friends?" box, found in your 'Edit profile' link when you sign in. This means that your Friends list can send you SMS but they cannot see your number from your Mobile Profile page. Of course you can remove your number altogether, which would still let you send SMS to your Friends list but not receive SMS from then in return. You can always select the types of SMS alerts you want to receive by going to 'Account settings' from your control panel after you sign in, and choosing the check box alert notifications accordingly .

Users within a personal network communicate on Wadja.com with each other through the Wadja.com service, without disclosing their email addresses. Users' full names are never directly revealed to other members. To facilitate searching and finding friends and acquaintances on the service, Wadja.com allows users to search for other members using their Wadja ID, screen name, first and last name, email address, and schools and/or companies where users may have attended or worked.

We may also use a user's email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding the service. Users may choose not to receive email of this type by changing their notification setting to not receive notification emails or sms messages in the user "Account Settings"

From time to time, Wadja.com or a partner, may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on Wadja.com. Users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. We may transfer personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply. 

**Invitations and Other Communications to Non-members**

Wadja members can invite friends to join the service by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system. Wadja.com stores the email addresses that members provide so that the respondents may be added to the friend's list of the member sending the invitations, and also to send reminders of the invitations Wadja.com does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations, invitation reminders (up to three (3) per email address). Recipients of invitations from Wadja.com may contact Wadja.com to request the removal of their information from our database.

Wadja members may also store email addresses and mobile number of people they know in their internal Wadja address book and may also choose to send invitations and other communications to those addresses.
