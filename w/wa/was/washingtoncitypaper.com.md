# Washington City Paper

Washington City Paper allows third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our Web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to [opt-out of this type of advertising](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp), you can visit [networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).

We also log domain names and IP addresses. This information is used primarily to discover which features users are reading the most, what features they like best, and what we can do to make things better.

We also may analyze the aggregated information and share that data with advertisers (for example, we might track how many users see and click on a particular advertisement).

On certain pages—for participation in our contests, games, subscription registrations, comment forums—we may ask users for names, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and demographic and/or personal information. This information is only gathered with the users' consent.

We will not share any user's personal information with any other organization, nor will we publish such information, unless we have your consent, are under a legal order to do so, or there is an emergency involving personal danger.

Please note that if a user gives out personal information online—for example, through a comment posting—that information can be collected and used by third parties. Although we strive to protect our users' privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of information users post in these forums. A user is disclosing such information at his or her own risk.

This policy has been developed with the understanding that the Internet is rapidly changing and evolving. Guidelines are subject to change. The changes will be posted here.

Washington City Paper is not responsible for the content or privacy policies of websites to which we may link.
