# Privacy | WassupBlog

As if I haven’t enough stuff to do with my time, Google in all it’s wisdom wants me to incorporate a Privacy Policy on all my blogs. This is all to do with the introduction of their [Interest Based Advertising](http://wassupblog.com/big-brother-google-opts-for-interest-based-advertising/), and even though my blogs will NOT be taking part I am still required to have a privacy policy.

As most of you already know it is a requirement of most blogs that you leave your email when commenting. You can be assured that this information will only ever be seen by my and no matter how much money I am offered to divulge said information it will forever remain for my eyes only.

The rest of this post has all to do with Google and rather than waste any more of my time rewording all their gobbledygook I’ll just  copy it straight from one of their pages.

> Your posted privacy policy should include the following information about Google and the [DoubleClick DART cookie](http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx):
> 
>   * Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on your site.
>   * Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet.
>   * Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

> Because publisher sites and laws across countries vary, we’re unable to suggest specific privacy policy language. However, you may wish to review resources such as the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/), or NAI, which suggests the following language for data collection of non-personally identifying information:  
>  We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

The above policy, which I have opted out of, comes after their previous policy of not quite a year ago which I have listed below.

It seems that Google will now be serving third party vendor ads via their Adsense ads so you need to be aware that from 23rd May 08 via Adsense we use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit this blog. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).
