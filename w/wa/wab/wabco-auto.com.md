WABCO Holdings Inc., together with its affiliates ("WABCO") is committed to protecting the privacy of our website users in accordance with applicable law.  

**I. SCOPE**

This Policy applies to all Personal Information (as defined below) received by WABCO in any format. WABCO sees the Internet and the use of other technologies as valuable tools for communicating and interacting with consumers, vendors, business partners and others. WABCO recognizes the importance of maintaining the privacy of Personal Information collected through websites that it operates. WABCO's sole purpose for operating its websites is to provide Information concerning products and services to the public. In general, visitors can access and use the WABCO websites without revealing any Personal Information. Visitors may elect to voluntarily provide Personal Information via WABCO websites but are not required to do so. 

WABCO collects information from visitors to the websites who voluntarily provide Personal Information by filling out and submitting online questionnaires concerning feedback on the website, requesting Information on products or services, or seeking employment. The Personal Information voluntarily provided by website users is contact information limited to the user's name, home and/or business address, phone numbers and email address. WABCO collects this information so it may answer questions and forward requested Information. WABCO does not sell or share this Information with non Agent third parties. 

WABCO may also collect anonymous information concerning website users through the use of "cookies" in order to provide better customer service. "Cookies" are small files that websites place on users' computers to identify the user and enhance the website experience. None of this Information is reviewed at an individual level. Visitors may set their browsers to provide notice before they receive a cookie, giving the opportunity to decide whether to accept the cookie. Visitors can also set their browsers to turn off cookies. If visitors do so, however, some areas of WABCO websites may not function properly. 

WABCO website users have the option to request that WABCO not use Information previously provided, correct information previously provided, or remove information previously provided to WABCO. Those that would like to correct or suppress information they have provided to WABCO should forward such inquiries to: [ _insert email address_ ]. The inquiries should include the individual's name, address, and other relevant contact information (phone number, email address). WABCO will use all reasonable efforts to honor such requests as quickly as possible. 

WABCO websites may contain links to other "non-WABCO" websites. WABCO assumes no responsibility for the content or the privacy policies and practices on those websites. WABCO encourages all users to read the privacy statements of those sites; their privacy practices may differ from those of WABCO.

Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide Personal Information to WABCO, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before WABCO uses the information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected. WABCO may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or to protect and defend the rights or property of WABCO. 

(2) CHOICE: WABCO will offer individuals the opportunity to choose whether their Personal Information is (a) to be disclosed to a non-agent third party, or (b) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. 

For sensitive Personal Information, WABCO will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly (opt-in) consent to the disclosure of the information to a non-agent third party or the use of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. 

WABCO will provide individuals with reasonable mechanisms to exercise their choices should requisite circumstances arise.
