# Watch Shop UK Privacy Policy

Our email address is sales@watchshopuk.com

We never disclose any information submitted to us to 3rd parties for any reason.

We do not use any of your data for any reason but to successfully ship your order to you. 

We only store your name, address and telephone number if you register for an account with us.  This is entirely optional, but enables you to place further orders without having to enter your details again.

We use cookies to allow us to store only the information required to process a transaction.  E.g. items in your shopping basket.

We do NOT store your credit card information.  It is processed over a secure SSL/128 bit encryption system which goes through the payment provider Protx.  We do not even see it, therefore it cannot be ‘hacked’ from our server.

A requirement when ordering is to supply your phone number.  This is only used for emergency purposes if we are unable to contact you via email.

If you wish, you can contact us to have your profile deleted at any point in time.

All sensitive information is processed over a secure server.

We do not send random marketing emails to personal email address (spam).

All of our data collection and storage conforms to the requirements of the Data Protection Act, 1998.

Our email address is sales@watchshopuk.com
