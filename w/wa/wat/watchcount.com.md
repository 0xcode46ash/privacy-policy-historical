# WatchCount.com - Privacy Policy Statement

### Privacy Policy Statement

This is the web site of: [www.WatchCount.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20080502193625id_/http%3A//www.watchcount.com/ "Home Page") . We can be reached via e-mail in 2 ways on our [Contact Us page](https://web.archive.org/web/20080502193625id_/http%3A//www.watchcount.com/contact.php "Contact Us"), and via the email address publicly registered in the web's Whois database.

For each visitor to our web page, our web server automatically recognizes the visitor's IP address. We temporarily collect the IP addresses of visitors to our website. This information we collect is used solely to track hits to our website and is discarded on a rolling basis, usually every couple days.

With respect to ad servers: To try and bring you offers that are related to the theme of our site, we have relationships with other companies (namely, [Google](http://www.google.com/ "Google")) that we allow to place ads on our web pages. As a result of your visit to our site, said ad server companies may collect general, non-personally-identifiable information such as your domain type, your IP address and clickstream information. For further information, consult the privacy policies of: [http://www.Google.com/privacy.html](http://www.google.com/privacy.html "Google's own Privacy Policy")

With respect to cookies that are issued to, or subsequently retrieved from, our visitors' browsers: We use cookies to record session information ("temporary/transient/session cookies") so that our services operate properly for each visitor. We also receive anonymous referrals/sales commissions from [eBay](https://web.archive.org/web/20080502193625id_/http%3A//www.watchcount.com/go/eBay/ "eBay") if visitors make purchases on eBay after clicking through to eBay while using our site (such cookies are issued by [eBay.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20080502193625id_/http%3A//www.watchcount.com/go/eBay/ "eBay") itself). We also use cookies to track repeated hits to our site (such cookies are issued by [StatCounter.com](http://www.statcounter.com/ "StatCounter.com")). Google too may issue and read cookies to/from your browser when you click on their ads served on this site. Moreover, web beacons may also be used to collect public, non-personally-identifiable information such as the country you are visiting from. (Sure seems like we track a lot of stuff, huh... Not really; it's all fairly common statistics and referral information that webmasters like us typically want to review in aggregate form.)

None of the above cookies or web beacons track personally identifiable information, nor do they track activities beyond the 4 sites mentioned (possible exception: we can't speak for how Google tracks activities after clicking through one of their ads). You can easily remove or block these persistent ("non-transient") cookies from your browser by using functions/settings within your browser. If you do so, you are still more than welcome to continue using our site, although temporary/session cookies are still required for our site to function correctly. Session cookies are easily removed by closing all of your browser windows, or shutting down your computer, or detonating your computer with dynamite (although we discourage the latter method due to liability issues). Your public, non-personally-identifiable information that is seen by web beacons can be shielded by said web beacons simply by disabling image downloads in your browser (simply closing your eyes won't help).

(Generally speaking, you can actually surf the web in a near-invisible manner by disabling most functions in your browser, like: images, JavaScript, and cookies - however most sites won't work properly for you without them.)

From time to time, we may use this general, non-personally-identifiable customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in this privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our web site on this web page to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our web site periodically.

With respect to security: Since we don't collect any personally identifiable or sensitive information from our visitors, we do not use encryption or high-security protocols.

Cookies, web beacons, IP addresses, ad servers... Don't worry; these things are all fairly standard with most any website you visit and are almost always used in benign ways, such as helping the website function properly and cleanly for its visitors. We fall into that majority.

If you feel that our site is not following its stated information policy, you may contact state or local chapters of the Better Business Bureau - but first please give us a shout via our [Contact Us page](https://web.archive.org/web/20080502193625id_/http%3A//www.watchcount.com/contact.php "Contact Us"); we'd rather not have the BBB breaking down our door or prank calling us in the middle of the night.

Thanks for your time. We tried to keep this short and sweet to minimize boredom. ([Did we succeed?](https://web.archive.org/web/20080502193625id_/http%3A//www.watchcount.com/contact.php "Shoot us an email"))
