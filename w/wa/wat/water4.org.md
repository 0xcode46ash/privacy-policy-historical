While we or third-parties acting on our behalf use information about our users on an aggregated basis and will often share such data with unaffiliated third parties, this information, by its aggregate nature, contains none of your Personal Information. When we refer to an “unaffiliated” third party, we mean one that (i) is not controlled by us, (ii) does not control us, and (iii) is not controlled by the same party controlling us.

We or third-parties acting on our behalf do and will continue to disclose your Personal Information to unaffiliated third parties in the following circumstances:

if required by law, regulatory or court order, or legal process;

if we determine that doing so would be in the public interest (i.e., if we were to suspect that you were using the Company Site in connection with the commission of a crime);

in connection with a sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization, or liquidation of the Company;

if you provide such information to us in connection with a promotion of a good or service offered by a third party, for purposes of such promotion, including, without limitation, sharing such information with that third party;

to provide you with certain services on the Company Site that are provided by such parties, as reasonably required to provide such services and;
