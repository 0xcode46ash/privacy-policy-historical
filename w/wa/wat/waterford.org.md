# Privacy Policy | Waterford Institute

This Website is owned and operated by Waterford Institute™. We recognize that visitors to our site may be concerned about the information they provide to us, and how we treat information. This Privacy Policy addresses those concerns.

## Privacy Statement

Waterford Institute uses its best efforts to respect your privacy. At our site, we do not collect personally identifiable information from you unless you provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly.

## Information Provided to Us

Waterford Institute gathers personally identifiable data, such as names, addresses, zip/postal codes, e-mail addresses, etc., only when voluntarily submitted. To facilitate payment and fulfillment in connection with purchases from us, we will request personal credit card, debit card, or other payment information. The primary use of your personal information, other than directly in connection with a purchase, is to efficiently provide you with personalized, relevant information.

Occasionally, we may also run contests or other special promotions on our Website in which we ask you for contact information (like an e-mail address) or demographic information (like a zip code, age, or income level). We use this data to send users promotional material about our company or our partners. The participant’s contact information is also used to contact him or her when necessary and may be shared with other companies for promotional purposes, but only with your prior permission and under the terms and conditions specified when you take part in the promotion. At any time, you may opt-out of receiving future mailings of this kind, or simply decline to take part in the promotions.

Any information gathered is used solely by Waterford Institute or other entities who are involved in the operation of this site for internal purposes. Waterford Institute lists are never sold to third parties. We will share personally identifiable information with third parties only when you authorize us to share it, or when we are required to do so by law.

We do reserve the right to disclose aggregated user statistics, such as “45 percent of our users are educators” or “5,000 members indicate an interest in science lessons” in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties.

Under protection of confidentiality agreements, we may also use third-party processors in some cases to help us provide services and manage our Websites and relationships with users. These may include purchase and order fulfillment, credit card processing, removing duplicate information from lists, providing marketing assistance, and providing other customer support. Third-party processors and providers will be given access only to that information needed to perform their support functions, and are prohibited from using it for other purposes.
