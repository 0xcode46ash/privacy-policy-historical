This site contains links to other sites. Upon selecting one of these links and leaving watchguard.com this privacy statement no longer applies.

**When you visit watchguard.com, what information do we gather about you?**  
In many sections of watchguard.com you are asked to register before downloading software, requesting product information, or joining an email newsletter list. There is a limited amount of information any Web site can gather about its visitors without the visitor explicitly providing information, such as that in an online form. Although watchguard.com logs IP addresses, we do not link this data to any personally identifiable information.

**What do we do with that information?**  
The personal information collected on watchguard.com is used to deliver requested WatchGuard product information. We do evaluate site usage by analyzing user information in the aggregate and only in a way that does not identify any individual user. Aggregate information may include demographic data, domain names, and site traffic, as long as none of these fields are linked to personal information. This analysis is used to improve our site and refine our services. This information is not sold or rented to other companies.

**With whom do we share this information?**  
Where we deem appropriate, contact information will be shared with WatchGuard Authorized Channel Partners to assist customers with their WatchGuard purchase decisions. Otherwise, information collected on this site is not distributed outside of WatchGuard. WatchGuard might also share information with parties with whom we contract to provide certain services such as broadcasting security alerts or updates. These contractors are also required to keep the information confidential and to not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for WatchGuard.

**WatchGuard Email deliverability and performance tracking policy**  
WatchGuard periodically sends email to recipients who have _"opted-in"_ to receiving email from us. WatchGuard uses various technologies to track deliverability and performance of those emails to ensure that they are reaching the recipients properly. When WatchGuard is troubleshooting an email deliverability problem with a specific recipient or group of recipients, deliverability and performance data for specific email addresses may be reviewed to assist in the troubleshooting process. Otherwise, the deliverability and performance data is analyzed in the aggregate.

**WatchGuard third party opt-out policy**  
If you would like to opt-out of WatchGuard sharing contact information with Channel Partners that assist customers with their WatchGuard purchase decision, please provide your information using by contacting Customer Care on the [web](http://unsubscribe.watchguard.com/) or on the [phone](https://web.archive.org/about/contact.asp?area=support).

**WatchGuard opt-out policy**  
If you would like to opt-out of being contacted by WatchGuard, please contact Customer Care on the [web](http://unsubscribe.watchguard.com/) or on the [phone](https://web.archive.org/about/contact.asp?area=support).

**WatchGuard policy on correcting and updating personally identifiable information**  
If you would like to correct and/or update your personally identifiable information, please contact Customer Care by [phone](https://web.archive.org/about/contact.asp?area=support).

**WatchGuard policy on deactivating your name or deleting it from our database**  
If you would like your name to be deleted or deactivated, please contact Customer Care by [phone](https://web.archive.org/about/contact.asp?area=support).

**Understanding the distinction between Security and Privacy**  
Security involves making sure that any sensitive information you may provide is safe and secure. Privacy refers to information we gather about you, and the use we make of it in the course of our business. 

**Interacting with WatchGuard via email**  
We do our best to promptly respond to all messages sent to Customer Care, and save messages that we think might be needed if the sender contacts us again. We do not sell or rent email addresses to other companies. Should you have a concern regarding email, please feel free to contact us by phone at +1.206.613.0895.
