### Use of Cookies

The Sites use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Sites as a convenience to users so that users do not repeatedly input the same information in different parts of the Sites or on repeat visits to the Sites. Cookies are small text files that are transferred from your browser to a web server which a web site can use to recognize a repeat visitor to the Sites. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, which gives you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. While DSW uses cookies to track your visit to the Sites, our web servers automatically log the IP/Internet address of your computer. This information does not identify you personally and you remain anonymous unless you have otherwise provided DSW with your personal information in which case we may combine this information with other information we have collected regarding you.
