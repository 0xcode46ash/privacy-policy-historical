## Wave Privacy Policy

### Accountability

Wave has designated a Privacy Officer who is responsible for the creation, oversight and implementation of our Privacy Policy and procedures to protect Personal Information, for receiving your privacy-related questions, and for providing you with information about our privacy practices. Our Privacy Officer is also responsible for notifying you of any material changes to our privacy practices, by posting updated information on our Site.

Attention: Privacy Officer  


### Identifying Purposes

Wave collects, uses, and discloses Personal Information only for the purposes of providing you with our Services and for such other ancillary purposes consented to by you as a user of the Wave Apps.

#### Personal Information

More specifically, Wave collects, uses and discloses information (which may include Personal Information) for the following purposes:

To provide you with our Services. For example, in order to allow us to retrieve banking information for use within the Wave Apps, we collect your or your business’ online banking credentials (i.e. account number, username and password; see Storage of Online Banking Credentials, below, for details) if you choose to provide them. 

To promote or offer you products, services and offers (including new and other Services which are offered by us, our sponsors and partners) that may be relevant to you and your business. When you are using our Services you may be provided with relevant savings opportunities and related links based on information related to your use of the Services. Wave will use your Personal Information for the purpose of tailoring savings opportunities to your interests. However, we will never share your Personal Information with companies offering the savings opportunities. We only provide these companies with non-identifiable, aggregate information (e.g. the number of times one of their savings opportunities was clicked).

To contact you for the purposes of product information, service updates, notifications relating to the Services, newsletters and tailored savings opportunity messages. Wave will never sell your contact details to a third party.

To monitor system usage, server and software performance, to improve system design, to create benchmarks and to conduct trending analyses. However, Wave will only use non-identifiable, aggregate information (e.g. number of users and transactions) for these purposes.

To assist you with technical support issues. It is important to remember that most technical issues can be resolved without a Wave customer service representative viewing your Personal Information.

To comply with any laws, regulation, court orders, subpoenas or other legal process or investigation and to protect ourselves and other individuals from harm.

To assist in due diligence relating to any corporate action such as a financing, merger, amalgamation, sale or divestiture, provided that reasonable safeguards are taken to protect the confidentiality of Personal Information in our possession.

### Consent

Wave takes a consent-based approach to the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information. We collect Personal Information directly from you and only obtain Personal Information from other organizations (e.g., your bank or other third party service providers) when you provide us with the account numbers, passwords or other credentials required to retrieve the Personal Information and for the purpose of providing you with our Services. We use and disclose the Personal Information only as described in this policy and our Terms of Use.

At any time and without penalty, Wave users can withdraw their consent and close their Wave account by taking the following actions:

  * Sign in to Wave. If you have more than one business registered with Wave, please make sure you are in the account you wish to close.
  * Click on Account in the upper right corner, and then click Your Profile in the drop-down menu.
  * Scroll to the bottom of the Edit your profile page. Click on the Close this Wave Account button. You will be asked if you are sure you want to permanently close your account. If you are sure, click on the button: Yes, close my account.

Once your account is closed, all Personal Information relating to your account will be deleted from our databases. However, anonymous transactional data (which does not personally identify you or any of your employees, agents, contractors and representatives) will be retained in our database.

At any time, Wave users can opt-out of most email communication from us by clicking on the opt-out link at the bottom of our emails, or via the “Account” page within our application. However, we may still contact you for administrative purposes (e.g. if we need to notify you of a change to our service, changes to our terms of use or privacy policy, there is a problem with your account or an anticipated service interruption, etc.).

Withdrawing your consent will not apply to actions Wave has already taken based on your prior consent.

In order to use certain Services, such as Wave’s payroll tools and services, you may be required to provide personal information relating to yourself and your employees, agents, contractors and representatives from time to time. You acknowledge, and represent to us that you only collect, use and disclose personal information in compliance with applicable privacy laws. You further represent and warrant to us that you have obtained all required consents (including, if you use Wave’s payroll tools and services, consents relating to making deposits to and debits from your employees’ bank accounts) from your employees, agents, contractors and representatives whose personal information will be disclosed to us or to our third party service providers in connection with the Services. With the sole exception of the payroll guarantee explained in the Terms of Use, you further agree to indemnify and hold Wave, its affiliates, subsidiaries, partners, service providers, suppliers and contractors and each of their respective officers, directors, agents, and employees (collectively, the “Wave Parties”), harmless for any loss, cost, complaint, damage, claim or liability whatsoever arising from your collection, use and disclosure of personal information relating to your employees, agents, contractors and representatives.

### Limiting Collection

Wave limits the collection of Personal Information by collecting only the information required to fulfill the identified purposes. We will collect only the minimum amount of information required to facilitate the Services. However, we provide you with the option of sharing additional information (e.g. your name or address) to enhance your use of the Services.

Wave does not knowingly or intentionally collect Personal Information from visitors who are under the age of thirteen (13).

You may in connection with some but not all of our Services have the ability to allow others (Guest Collaborators) access to your account. If you choose to allow others access to your account, you will need to provide the individual’s name and email address. We will automatically send your guest a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Site. Wave stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking Site usage. The individual may contact us at privacy@waveapps.com to request that we remove this information from our database. A Guest Collaborator who accepts the collaboration invitation will be subject to and must agree to the same terms as a regular Wave customer. Note that by providing Guest Collaborators access to your account, you will also be providing the Guest Collaborator access to any Personal Information in your account. While the Guest Collaborator must agree to our terms of use, we take no responsibility for any collection, use or disclosure of your Personal Information by your Guest Collaborator. It is your responsibility to ensure that your Guest Collaborator complies with privacy standards that are no less stringent than our own.

When you use certain Services, you have the option to share information with other accounts you have signed up for. You may choose from time to time to connect Wave with other third party service providers in order to utilize these services in conjunction with the Wave Apps. Purposes may include saving copies of records, importing data from external sources, communications with third parties, and conducting payment and direct deposit functions, among others. In such instances, your account and password credentials and other required information in respect of such third party service may be stored by Wave for the purpose of providing this service. 

### Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention

Wave will not use or disclose Personal Information for purposes other than the identified purposes of the Services or such other purposes which we identify from time to time. 

We also ensure that only those employees responsible for the Services’ operations have physical or technical access to Personal Information and only where such access is required to perform work authorized by their supervisors.

Wave will retain Personal Information only for the duration of your enrollment as a Wave user and Personal Information will be retained in secure and segregated databases. If you choose to withdraw from the Services, we will securely destroy your Personal Information in our possession and control within 30 days unless we are required to retain such Personal Information longer to fulfill our obligations to you or to third parties. However, we may retain non-personally identifiable information indefinitely.

Payroll data will be retained for a period of five years from the date of employer's first payroll processing in order to comply with government regulations regarding retention of payroll data. Payroll data includes but is not limited to (a) employer name, address, tax rates, exempt status and (b) employee name, address, bank account information, SSN or SIN, rate of pay, hire date, birth date, filing status, allowances, benefits and deductions and (c) gross pay, taxes, deductions and net pay for every payroll processed.

We retain all Personal Information provided by you or your bank on secure servers in Canada. However some of our third party partners and service providers may store data received from you (including Personal Information) on servers outside Canada. This data will be subject to the laws of those jurisdictions. Our third party service providers, including financial institutions, have their own terms of use and privacy policies that will govern your relationship with these third parties. You are responsible for reviewing and agreeing to these terms of use and policies. If you do not agree with these terms of use or privacy policies you should not use the services offered by such third party service providers. 

In the future we may collect information, including Personal Information, to enable you to access services provided by our third party partners and service providers whose servers may be located outside Canada. You will be subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of these third party service providers. You are responsible for reviewing and agreeing to these terms of use and policies. If you do not agree with these terms of use or privacy policies you should not use the services offered by such third party service providers.

When Wave data is viewed via a mobile device, some data is cached in the memory of the device. That data is deleted when the related application is closed and does not persist. If the application is put in the background without closing, the data may remain in the cache. We take no responsibility for any unauthorized viewing of this data by third parties.

#### Storage of Online Banking Credentials

You may choose to provide your online banking information, for the purpose of importing transactions into Wave and reducing your manual entry workload. To provide improved security and reliability, Wave employs a respected provider of global online banking solutions. This partner stores account and password information. Wave does not store these. This third party uses Triple DES encryption and secure storage protocols to protect Wave customer data.

### Accuracy

Wave relies on you to ensure that the Personal Information you provide to us while using the Services is as accurate, complete and up-to-date as necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used. You are welcome to make changes or corrections to Personal Information at any time.

We also make every effort to ensure the accuracy of the information in our reports, displays, articles and support queries. However, you must verify all information created from your use of the Services and we recommend that you consult an accounting professional before completing any government or regulatory filing or otherwise relying upon the information, as the use of this information is at your own risk.

You are responsible for ensuring that that the information you have provided is truthful, accurate, reliable and complete.

### Safeguards

Wave implements industry best practices appropriate to the sensitivity of your Personal Information. We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your Personal Information against loss, theft, and unauthorized access, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal, or destruction in accordance with applicable legal requirements and industry best practices.

For example, we implement encryption and security controls to protect against unauthorized access to Personal Information during electronic transmission, and we train our employees to follow privacy and security practices specific to the Services. We also undertake security assessments to ensure that we maintain strong security controls.

We ensure that any third party acting on our behalf in respect of your Personal Information maintains reasonable and appropriate safeguards. For example, these third parties classify customer account data as “super sensitive”. This means that access to such data is strictly limited based on business need and this data cannot be transmitted without the use of approved encryption methods. These third parties also employ both an Intrusion Detection System and an Intrusion Prevention System, and run regular network vulnerability scans. Additional information about our third parties’ privacy practices is available upon request.

### Openness

Wave makes clear and transparent notice of its privacy practices publicly available via our Privacy Commitment and this policy. Our notices describe the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of Personal Information and provide the contact information of our privacy contact person.

Wave will advise you at the first reasonable opportunity upon discovering or being advised of an incident where your personal information is lost, stolen, accessed, used, disclosed, copied, modified or disposed of by unauthorized persons or in an unauthorized manner.

### Individual Access

You own your data which you input using the Wave Apps and can download your own data via the Site at any time. Upon request, Wave will also provide you with a list of the entities (e.g. third party service providers) to whom Wave has disclosed your Personal Information, and the countries in which our servers are located (i.e., Canada).

### Additional Features

The Wave Apps may offer publicly accessible blogs and community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. We take no responsibility for any information which you or your employees, agents, contractors and representatives post or publish on the Wave Apps and you agree to indemnify and hold the Wave Parties harmless for any loss, cost, complaint, damage, claim or liability whatsoever arising from any such post or publication.

With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you want your testimonial removed please contact us at [privacy@waveapps.com](mailto:privacy@waveapps.com).

### Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

#### Third Party Tracking Technologies & Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We and some of our affiliates and third party service providers use session ID cookies on the Site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our Site. We use session cookies to make it possible to navigate the secure environment inside our Site. When you log into Wave, your browser may ask if you want it to remember you as a registered user of Wave. If you accept, the session ID becomes a persistent cookie, which expires after two weeks of non-use. You can remove persistent cookies manually by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. If you refuse cookies, you will not be able to use Wave, since session ID cookies are essential to navigation.

The use of cookies by our tracking utility company and service providers is not covered by our Privacy Policy. Wave uses Google Analytics™, a third-party tracking service, which uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about users of our Site in the aggregate to capture usage and volume statistics. We have no access to or control over these cookies. Information about Google Analytics™’ Privacy Policy can be found at <http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html>.

We use Zendesk, a third-party customer support platform, which uses cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Help section. We have no access to or control over these cookies. Zendesk uses a cookie to track your session, which expires when you close your browser, and another optional cookie to remember your login for up to two weeks of inactivity. These cookies may be removed manually by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s "help" file.

Our third party partners employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts that help them better manage content on our site. We do not tie the information gathered to our users’ personally identifiable information.

Wave may from time to time implement other third-party analytics services that also use cookies. Wave will ensure that no personally identifiable information is included in those cookies. If the use of cookies by any service provider differs materially from the practices already listed, we will revise this document accordingly and notify existing customers of the change(s).

#### Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting

We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences.truste.com/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

#### Device Tokens

In order for Wave to communicate with you via the Wave app which you may choose to install on your mobile device, we save a "device token" on your device. We use the device token to provide you with notifications relating to the Services. The device token identifies your mobile device to us but cannot be used to identify you. We store the token in encrypted format (base-64 encoded) and retain it only as long as necessary to provide you with the Services.

### Agents/Service Providers

Wave uses third-party email services providers in order to effectively deliver emails to you. For occasional messages from Wave, we will share only your email address and name (where applicable) with this provider. For the weekly summary of your account information (the "Your week in numbers" email), we will share your email address and name (where applicable) and send via our providers news about your account balances, year-to-date financial overview, overdue invoices and expenses and other select account details. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. To unsubscribe from either or both emails, please see the "Consent" section above.

### Notification of Privacy Statement Changes

We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on our website prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review our Privacy Policy for the latest information on our privacy practices.
