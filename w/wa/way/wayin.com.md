# Privacy Policy - Wayin

This Privacy Policy applies to Wayin.com (the “ **Site** ”) and Wayin Inc. affiliates including Wayin Limited (f/k/a Engage Software Limited), EngageSciences Corp., Comenta LLC and other services provided to third parties by Wayin, Inc. as further described below (“ **Services** ”). By using the Site or the Services, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy, you may not use our Site or Services.

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the [Terms of Use](https://www.wayin.com/terms-of-use/) governing your use of our Site. Any capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy will have the definitions provided in our Terms of Use.

##### Scope of this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to information collected through our Site, and also describes certain privacy practices with regard to the Services provided by Wayin to third parties. The Services include without limitation, social media hubs, widgets, campaign platforms, and APIs for use on third party sites or in third party broadcast programming. The Services typically include feeds of “tweets” (consisting of text, pictures, videos, links to websites, or other content) provided to Wayin by Twitter, Inc. (“ **Twitter** ”), other social media content created by end-users and provided through other social media platforms (together with tweets, the “ **Social Media Content** ”), as well as promotions, sweepstakes, polling, product feedback and reviewing, and other promotional or advertising campaigns (“ **Promotions** ”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you may provide to us by email, phone, fax, in written agreements, or otherwise.

“ **PII** ” means “personally identifiable information,” which is information that identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us (including without limitation your name, address, email address, telephone number, or other personal information) and any other information about or relating to an identified or identifiable individual. “ **Non-PII** ” means “non-personally identifiable information” or other information which alone does not identify you. We sometimes refer to both PII and Non-PII in this Privacy Policy as “ **Information**.” Social Media Content may include PII and/or Non-PII, depending on the content voluntarily submitted to the social media platform by the applicable end-user.

##### Collection of Your Information

**Social Media Content.** Anything a Twitter user may tweet to a hashtag being used by one of the Services, or any other Social Media Content submitted by an end-user to the applicable social media platform and which is then automatically provided by that platform to Wayin (via API or otherwise), may instantly be visible to anyone viewing the applicable Service anywhere in the world (subject to the privacy settings you have established in your account with the applicable social media platform). By submitting any public Social Media Content (as controlled by your account settings with the applicable social media platform, if any) to the applicable hashtag promoted in a Service, or otherwise in a manner that transmits such Social Media Content to a Service, you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure, and other use of the Information contained within the Social Media Content, to any country in which the Service is provided. You further consent that any Information you tweet or otherwise post to a social media platform will be provided by you directly to the applicable social media platform, and accordingly will be subject to that platform’s own Privacy Policy and the controls you have established on your social media account with that platform (including without limitation the privacy settings for that account, if any).

**Promotion Data.** When you participate in a Promotion provided by Wayin or as part of our Services, we may collect certain PII from you, including your name, email, and other Information which may be requested by the party sponsoring/running the Promotion. We use this Information and PII as necessary to administer the Promotion, and we may share it with our client or other party on whose behalf we administer the Promotion. Note that we may collect and share this information for promotional and advertising purposes, in order to provide any other service you request, or in order to obtain data requested by our customers. You may receive emails from either us or the third party sponsoring/running the Promotion, or from third parties with whom your PII has been shared.

**Contests or Sweepstakes.** We may operate our own contests and sweepstakes through the Site and Services which may require registration and submission of PII (such as your name, email, and address) in order to enter. Your PII may be used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other promotional purposes. Your entry in the contest or sweepstakes may also result in your being added to our marketing lists as well as those of our promotional partners associated with the contest or sweepstakes. Acceptance of a prize may require you (unless prohibited by law) to allow us to post publicly some of your information on the Site or through the Services, such as on a winner’s page. As discussed above, we may also administer or host a contest or sweepstakes on behalf of a third party on our Site or through our Services. In those cases, we may have no control over the information collected and accordingly urge you to review the official rules of the contest/sweepstakes as well as the advertiser’s or sponsor’s privacy policy, before participating.

**Optional Voluntary Information.** In order to request information about Wayin or our Services, or otherwise contact us through our Site, you may be required to voluntarily submit certain PII such as your name and email address. Contacting us through our Site or requesting information about our Services is purely optional, and you are not required to submit any PII through our Site or Services. If you decide to contact us or request information about our Services, we will use the information you submit to respond to your inquiry, and we may add you to our mailing list.

**Usage Data**. Wayin may track user traffic patterns and content accessed throughout our Site or Services. This information allows us to better tailor our content or Services to meet the needs of our users and clients, and to help us and our Clients better understand our or their audience.

**Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser**. We may collect information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser, such as your IP address, the address of the web page you were visiting when you accessed our Site, information on your operating system and browser, and the date and time of your visit. Such information cannot typically be used to identify you personally, although certain jurisdictions may consider your IP address to be PII. We generally use this information to better understand how users interact with our Site and Services, and to provide a more user friendly experience. In addition, we may review our server logs for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network.

**Client Dashboards**. If our clients choose to access the online dashboards by which they can control our Services (which may be accessible through our Site or otherwise), we will collect only the Information required to log in to the dashboard. You do not need to provide this Information to us unless you choose to use the applicable dashboard.

##### Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies

Our Site, or our current or future service providers, may place a text file called a “cookie” on your computer, which may store preferences or other information, and may be used to help personalize your experience when using our Site. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. We may use cookies to learn the source of traffic to our Site (including the site you were visiting before you came to our Site), and to store your other preferences when using our Site.

We use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about use of our Site and our Services. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit our Site or our Services, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this Site or our Services. We use the information we get from Google Analytics to maintain and improve the technical performance of our Site and our Services. We may also transfer the information we get from Google Analytics to the client to whom we are providing the relevant Service. Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit our Site or use our Services, rather than your name or other identifying information.
