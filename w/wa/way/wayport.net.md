# Wayport Privacy Policy

### WAYPORT PRIVACY POLICY

**Our Commitment to Your Privacy**

Wayport wants to make your online experience enjoyable while respecting your privacy interests. Our data collection policies allow you to choose how much information to provide to us and to control how we use whatever information you tell us. Our goal is to provide you with an exceptional online experience while allowing you to control your privacy as well as giving you a means to voice any questions or concerns you may have.

**Types of Information Gathered and How it is Used**

  1. **Anonymous Data:** During a user's Wayport session, various technical data is collected through our network monitoring software which does not reveal any personal information about a particular customer. We also count, track and aggregate a customer's network activity into our analysis of general traffic flows on our network. From this information we can determine how many people used our service at a particular location on a particular day, for how long, etc. Many individuals who utilize our service choose not to provide us with optional personal information and thus remain anonymous to us. 
  2. **Personal Information:** This information includes facts which personally identify a customer such as your name, postal address, email address, preferences, etc. The extent of the information provided is up to the particular person and you always have the option not to provide any personal information. The personal information we collect from you is used to provide you with updates about our services and locations and special events and services offered by the hotel. If necessary, a customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information; accordingly it is subject to our company's security procedures regarding protection and use of confidential information. Information is generally processed and stored in the United States, in which data protection laws are not as comprehensive as in the European Union. Wayport does not provide a user's personal information to any third party.



Currently, all information is gathered by Wayport's employees and maintained internally.

**Wayport Cares about Protecting the Privacy of Your Family**

We at Wayport are concerned about the safety of minor children when they use the Internet. We want you and your family to be safe while using the Wayport network. That's why we have established the following guidelines for the way we interact with children when they access our services. Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent. Furthermore, children as a rule cannot gain access to the Wayport network unless their parent or guardian has checked into the hotel using a major credit card. In addition, parents always have the option of requesting the hotel staff or Wayport to disable the network port in their room.

In the case where you received a special promotion due to the involvement of a third party Marketing Partner with Wayport, this information will be shared with that marketing partner. In this case your information is then covered under that Marketing Partners Privacy Policy. It is the end users responsibility to understand the other policy in this case. The referring membership page will have a link to the appropriate Marketing Partners Privacy Policy.

**Links to Other Sites / Co-Branded Sites**

This site contains links to other sites which provide local information about a particular city or hotel. Wayport is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any such Web site. 

Wayport often participates in co-branding of hotel websites for which Wayport provides network connectivity services. These co-branded websites inform visitors that the particular hotel offers fast Internet connectivity powered by Wayport and provides a link to Wayport's website.

**You Choose Whether to Opt Into or Opt Out-of Providing Personal Information and Receiving Communications from Wayport or 3rd Parties.**

Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-in to providing Wayport with personal information, as well as a separate opportunity to opt-in to receiving communications from us and our partners. If you provide us with any personal information, we will only use that information to keep you informed of other locations where our services are available or other news events regarding Wayport or its partners that may be of interest to you. We will not provide your information to third parties, other than, on very limited occasions, to the hotel property management at the location where you are registered so that the property can inform you of promotions and allow you the option to update your personal information on file with the property. At any time, you may inform such third parties of your desire to opt out of receiving any more communications from them.

**Use of MAC Addresses and IP Addresses**

Wayport does record the MAC (Media Access Controller) address from the network card in your computer solely for billing purposes. This is helpful in providing accurate billing and avoiding double billing.

**Security Measures to Protect Your Privacy**

This site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of the information under our control. We have put into place protections to ensure that a guest in another room or hotel staff members cannot intercept, view or otherwise 'sniff' your information. However, once your information leaves the premises where you are accessing this data, it is only as secure as the Internet at large. We encourage you to take whatever measures you deem appropriate to secure your data as it transits the Internet. 

You can be assured that when you are browsing a secure site (you can tell by a closed lock icon in the lower lefthand corner of your Netscape browser or on the lower righthand side of your Internet Explorer browser) your data will remain still secure. Nothing in the Wayport system will thwart such built-in security of other sites.

For a secure connection to your company's LAN, you should follow whatever policies have been put into place by your IT division, or if no such policy exists, Wayport supports all forms of personal VPNs and suggests the following as some of the better products on the market to protect your information: PGP-VPN, PPTP and endorses solutions based on Ipsec and IKE as further described in the following network security standards: RFC 2401 through RFC 2412 inclusive.

**Corrections/Updates to Personal Information**

If at any time you would like to submit updates or changes to your personal information, or request that we delete such information from our records please send an email with your request to [subscriptions@wayport.net](mailto:subscriptions@wayport.net). Should you decide to opt-out of receiving communications from 3rd parties you should contact that 3rd party directly. Wayport is not responsible for removing information from the list of any 3rd party with whom you may have authorized us to share your information.

Wayport may change or modify its privacy policy from time to time. Please check Wayport's home page for a link to the most current privacy policy.
