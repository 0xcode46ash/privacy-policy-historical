**Where Are You Now? Privacy Policy  **

This is a legal document which sets out how Where Are You Now? handles data which identifies you. You should read it in conjunction with the Where Are You Now? Terms and Conditions, of which this Privacy Policy forms part. 

At Where Are You Now?, we believe strongly in protecting the privacy of our users’ personal information. This statement describes the privacy practices we apply for the Where Are You Now? Service. As part of that, it also expresses our approach to complying with the data protection laws which apply in the United Kingdom. If we change this Privacy Policy, we will notify you of the changed document in the same way as we notify changes to the Where Are You Now? Terms and Conditions. 

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact Where Are You Now?'s customer services. 

**1\. The information we gather and track.  **

Information gathered on registration. When you register for the Where Are You Now? Service, you provide your name, your email address, your gender, your date of birth, nationality, your location details and some optional details about yourself ("Registration Information"). They are available to you, and capable of being changed, through the “My Details” page. 

Cookies. We use small files known as "cookies" to enhance users’ experience of the Where Are You Now? Service as follows:   
To hold Members’ login information, so that your location details and contact information are displayed when you visit the Where Are You Now? Service. This option can be disabled by clicking the “logoff” icon which appears at the top right hand corner of every page.   
To facilitate optimal use of the Where Are You Now? Service by Members, by means of a temporary "session" cookie. These cookies disappear when the Member’s browser session ends, or if the Member clicks the "logoff" icon which appears on the Where Are You Now? Service. 

_Third Party Advertising_   
We use MaxOnline and other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please [click here](http://www.maxonline.com/privacy_policy/index.php).

 _Third Party Cookies_  
In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your browser. 

**2\. Sharing and use of information  **

The over-riding principles we apply are these:   
We, and (where relevant) our credit card processing agents, will not supply your personal data to a third party for commercial exploitation – thus, you can rest assured that we will not sell the lists of our Members’ email addresses to a third party; and   
the only circumstances in which we will provide any of your personal data to a third party for non-commercial purposes are those contained in this Privacy Policy. 

Registration Information. Once a Member selects a location, some or all of the information held for that Member, except for the email address and mobile/cell phone number and passwords, will be publicly available at the listing for that location. 

Your home location, and any other location specific information you submit to the WhereAreYouNow? service must be considered at all times to be publicly available information, unless where the option to keep private such information is available and activated.

Email addresses. We do not directly make your email address available to anyone on any screen of the Where Are You Now? Service. The only legitimate way of making contact with a friend found on the Where Are You Now? Service is for a Full Member to enter a message which we will send on the Member’s behalf. The email sent will include the sending Full Member’s email address so that the recipient can respond to the sender directly. This means by sending a contact message, the sending Member is disclosing his/her email address. Members may change their email address at any time through My Details. Members’ personal notes must not include their email address. If your email system automatically responds to a contact email, your email address will be revealed. 

Un-validated memberships. If you register for the WhereAreYouNow.com service, but fail to validate your membership then we may contact you via email at periods of 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days at your registered email address to notify you of the invalid status. Should you fail to respond to these notifications then we will send you one final notice before the un-validated membership is removed. 

Advertising. The Where Are You Now? Service may include interactive advertising for other businesses. We may use, and provide to third parties, anonymous demographic data provided by Members to target this advertising more appropriately.   
Telephone numbers. You may enter a contact telephone number in your personal details. This number is for internal use only, for future or current services such as SMS. Your number will never be disclosed to any third party without your prior consent. Should we introduce a service which utilizes telephone numbers, you will be given the option to 'OPT-IN' as we believe it should be your choice what services you receive. 

Newsletters. We have regular and occasional emails, which Members can decide to take or not, according to their preferences. This option is selected through My Details. 

Notification of unread messages. If you have a number of messages waiting for you in your WhereAreYouNow mailbox, and you have not logged in to the service for an extended period, we may at our discretion contact you via your registered email address to notify you of the unread messages. Should you still not read and remove these messages then we may remove the messages as part of our data cleansing process. 

Credit Card information. There has been a lot of publicity about Credit Card security on the Internet so we decided to use Worldpay plc, who operate a secure server, to process our credit card payments. They encrypt Members’ credit or debit card information and authorise payment directly. This means that Members’ credit card details are never revealed to us. Worldpay plc may transfer to, process and hold your credit card information in countries either within or outside the European Economic Area in connection with performing their duties. 

Companies in the Where Are You Now group. We may share data supplied by you (or collected about you) with our subsidiaries and other companies in our group, but only for the purposes described in this policy. 

Changes in Where Are You Now?’s business. If all of the assets which Where Are You Now? uses to operate its business (or substantially all of them) are acquired by a third party, we may transfer personal data we then hold to that party.   
Place of processing. The personal information held by us is held on and processed by computers situated in the United Kingdom.

   
**3\. Security  **

We have security measures in place to protect our customer database and access to this database is restricted internally. However, it remains each Member’s responsibility: 

to protect against unauthorised access to Your Details;   
to ensure against use by anyone else of the Where Are You Now? Service through the machine that Member uses while they are "logged on" to the Where Are You Now? Service;   
to log off or exit from the Where Are You Now? Service when not using it; and   
to keep his/her password secret. 

  
**4\. Opt-out policy  **

You may have your registration details removed at any time. To remove yourself, please click [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20050521074452id_/http%3A//www.wayn.com/wayn.html?wci=support&step=a&pid=15&qid=114) to view instructions on the removal process. 

We provide Members with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving e-mailed Newsletters which they have previously opted to receive. This opt-out can be put into effect by making appropriate selections at My Details. 

**5\. Disclosure for legal reasons  **

We reserve the right to communicate such of a Member’s personal information as we hold to third parties which seek the disclosure of it, and which make a legally-compliant request for its disclosure. 

**6\. Contacting Where Are You Now?  **

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with Where Are You Now?, you can contact us here. You can also use this address if you wish to request from Where Are You Now? a copy of the personal data we hold about you or a description of that data. Please note that by English law we are entitled to charge you a small sum for providing this information. 

**7\. Links to third party sites  **

Our site contains links to other sites. Where Are You Now? is not responsible for the privacy practices, or the content, of those web sites. 

**8\. Data Protection Information  **

You can obtain further information about data protection laws by visiting the Information Commissioner’s website at www.dataprotection.gov.uk. You can search for our Data Protection Notification there, should you so wish.
