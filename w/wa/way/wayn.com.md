5\. **Sharing and use of information**

Any visitor of the WAYN.com website can view your profile information and photos that you have uploaded to the WAYN.com community. You can control what part of your profile information and photos is visible to visitors of the WAYN.com website and which network of WAYN.com members can see what information. 

The over-riding principles we apply are these: 

We, and (where relevant) our credit card processing agents, will not supply your personal data to a third party for commercial exploitation except as consented to by you in accordance with prevailing law. 

Registration Information. Once a Member selects a location, some or all of the information held for that Member, except for the email address, telephone numbers and passwords, will be publicly available at the listing for that location. 

Your home location, in terms of your town / city, state / county and country, and any other location specific information you submit to the WAYN Service must be considered at all times to be publicly available information, save where the option to keep private such information is available and activated by the Member. In addition, if address details are submitted to the WAYN.com service they are not made publicly available. 

Email addresses. We do not directly make your email address available to anyone on any screen of the WAYN Service. The only legitimate way of making contact with a person found on the WAYN Service is for a Full Member to enter a message which we will send on the Member's behalf. The email sent will include the sending Full Member's email address so that the recipient can respond to the sender directly. This means by sending a message, the sending Member is disclosing his/her email address. Members may change their email address at any by clicking on “Edit Personal Details”, once confirming their password, which is accessible from the Settings Menu or VIP Settings Menu found at the top of most pages when logged on to the WAYN service. If your email system automatically responds to a contact email with a read or delivery receipt, your email address will be revealed. 

Un-validated Memberships. If you register for the WAYN Service, and you receive a validation email, but fail to validate your Membership then we may contact you via email at periods of 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days at your registered email address to notify you of the invalid status. Should you fail to respond to these notifications then we may send you one final notice before the un-validated Membership is removed. 

Advertising. The WAYN Service may include interactive advertising for other businesses. We may use, and provide to third parties, anonymous demographic data provided by Members to target this advertising more appropriately. 

Telephone numbers. You may enter a contact telephone number in your Personal Details. This number is for internal use only, for future or current services such as SMS. Your number will never be disclosed to any third party without your prior consent. Should we introduce an additional service which utilises telephone numbers, or we wish to provide you with informational content via your mobile phone, you will be given the option to agree to this, as we believe it should be your choice what services you receive. 

Emails. We send regular and occasional emails. Members can determine whether to receive certain emails from their "Privacy Preferences" which can be accessed via the Settings or VIP settings menu, found at the top of most pages when logged into the WAYN service. 

Notification of unread messages. If you have a number of messages waiting for you in your WAYN mailbox, and you have not logged in to the service for an extended period, we may at our discretion contact you via your registered email address to notify you of the unread messages. Should you still not read and remove these messages then we may remove the messages as part of our data cleansing process. 

Credit Card information. There has been a lot of publicity about Credit Card security on the Internet so we work with the leading Merchant Providers in the industry who specialize in Fraud and Data Verification. These companies include Protx and Meta Charge. Members' credit or debit card information is encrypted and stored securely. We share your billing information with such companies insofar as necessary for the processing of your payment or to prevent or detect fraud. These companies have agreed not to retain, share, store or use your personally identifiable information for any secondary purpose. 

WAYN companies and subsidiaries. We may share data supplied by you (or collected about you) with our subsidiaries and other companies owned by us, but only for the purposes described in this policy. 

Changes in WAYN's business. If all of the assets which WAYN uses to operate its business (or substantially all of them) are acquired by a third party, we may transfer personal data we then hold to that party. 

Place of processing. The personal information held by us is held on and processed by computers situated in the United Kingdom or in Poland. 

6\. **Sharing Information**

When you use the WAYN service, you may form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, form groups, set up events, and transmit information through various channels. We collect this information so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your friend list. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.   
You post User Content (as defined in the WAYN Terms of Service) on the Site at your own risk. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that User Content you post on the Site will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Users have copied or stored your User Content. 

Where Are You Now? Ltd may also collect information about you from other sources, such as newspapers, blogs, instant messaging services, and other users of the WAYN.com service through the operation of the service (e.g. photo tags) in order to provide you with more useful information and a more personalized experience. 

When you register to the WAYN service, you can create your own profile and determine your own privacy settings. Your profile information, as well as your name, email and photo, are displayed to people in the networks specified in your privacy settings to enable you to connect with other members of WAYN.com. We may occasionally send you notifications regarding new services offered by WAYN.com that we think you may find valuable, unless indicated otherwise in your privacy settings.   
Your Profile information is used by WAYN.com primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the service and to be presented to others permitted to view that information by your privacy settings. In some cases where your privacy settings permit it.   
Profile information you submit to the WAYN service will be available to users of WAYN who belong to at least one of the networks you allow to access the information through your privacy. Your name and profile picture thumbnail will be available in all search results across the WAYN.com network and those limited pieces of information may be made available to third party search engines. This is primarily so your friends can find you and send a friend request. People who see your name in searches, however, will not be able to access your profile information unless they are linked to you (friend, friend of friend, member of your groups, etc.) that allows such access based on your privacy settings. 

Your news feeds and friends feeds may aggregate the information you provide and make it available to your friends and network members according to your privacy settings. You may set your preferences for your news feeds at any time by adjusting your Privacy Settings 

7\. **Security**

We have security measures in place to protect our customer database and access to this database is restricted internally. However, it remains each Member’s responsibility: 

to protect against unauthorised access to Your Details;   
to ensure against use by anyone else of the WAYN Service through the machine that Member uses while they are "logged on" to the WAYN Service; to log off or exit from the WAYN Service when not using it; and to keep his/her password secret. 

8\. **Remove details**

You may have your registration details removed at any time. To remove yourself, please click [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20070509004620id_/http%3A//www.wayn.com/wayn.html?wci=unregister) to view instructions on the removal process. Alternatively, email us at [remove@wayn.com](mailto:remove@wayn.com) and we will endeavour to remove your details within 24 to 48 hours of receipt of the email. 

9\. **Invite a Friend**

If Members elect to permit WAYN to search email addresses held within their email service on their behalf and click on “Import & Invite Friends”, they accept that by doing so, an email invitation will be sent on their behalf, to the relevant email address, and that from time to time a reminder email could be sent to that contact, on their behalf. In addition, if Members click on “Refer a Friend” or opt to Invite a Friend from any other link on the WAYN website, and submit email addresses of their contacts to invite to join the WAYN service, they accept that by doing so, an email invitation will be sent on their behalf, to the relevant email address, and that from time to time a reminder email could be sent to that contact, on their behalf. By inviting their contacts to join the site, the Member agrees that they have obtained prior consent from their contacts (a) to send them such an invitation and reminder, and (b) to allow the other action referred to in this Clause and in Clause 8. WAYN stores the name and email address of the contacts for the purpose of automatically adding the respondent to the contacts list of the Member sending the invitation and to send reminders of the invitation on the Member’s behalf. The Members' username and password will not be saved anywhere on the site. The names of the contacts being uploaded will also be searchable via the name search facility to enable other WAYN Members to find old contacts. Other WAYN Members will be able to send an anonymous message to the Member who imported the contact name being searched, with a description of the person they are trying to get back in touch with, enabling the Member who uploaded the contact to potentially connect the two people together. WAYN does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders on behalf of the Member. The Member or the Contact of the Member’s contacts can request the removal of their details from our database at any time by sending an email to: [remove@wayn.com](mailto:remove@wayn.com). 

10\. **Importing your Contacts**

If Members elect to import their contacts, they accept that by doing so, an email invitation will be sent on their behalf, to the email addresses of the contacts that are being imported and that from time to time, a reminder email could be sent to that contact, on their behalf.

WAYN stores the name and email address of the contacts to enable the Member to contact their contacts via the WAYN service and to send reminders of the invitation on the Member’s behalf. The Member’s username and password will not be saved anywhere on the site. The names of the contacts being imported will also be searchable via the name search facility on the WAYN.com website to enable other WAYN Members to find old friends. Other WAYN Members will be able to send an anonymous email to the Member who uploaded the contact name being searched, with a description of the person they are trying to get back in touch with, enabling the Member who uploaded the contact to potentially connect the two people together. WAYN does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders on behalf of the Member. The Member or the Member’s contacts can request the removal of their details from the WAYN database at any time by sending an email to: [remove@wayn.com](mailto:remove@wayn.com).
