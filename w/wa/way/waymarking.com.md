### 3\. WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

Except as provided below, we do not share or sell information that identifies our users personally or makes it possible for other parties to contact them directly. We share your personal information as follows: 

  1. **Other Users.** We may disclose personal information to other people who use our services if you choose to include personal information, such as your email address, photo or other details, in your public profile. Your username and location and any other information or content you post publicly will be shared with others when you use the public features of our services, such as logging a geocache or participating in the discussion forums.
  2. **Partners.** We license our API to partners who use it to develop other geocaching-related services, including websites and mobile applications. Any information you have included on your public profile or geocache logs (including photos) will be accessible to them through the API. Our [API License Agreement](https://web.archive.org/live/api_license_agreement.aspx) requires our API partners to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy with regard to any information acquired through our API or submitted through use of their websites or mobile applications and to have their own privacy policy that provides at least the level of protection of this Privacy Policy. We provide location information to our map providers without identifying you specifically for the purpose of enabling map functionality. Additionally, we may partner with other companies to provide promotions. If you choose to participate in the promotion, the information you provide may be shared as necessary to enable your participation and to allow the promotion sponsor to contact you.
  3. **Third Party Service Providers.** From time to time, we employ other companies and individuals to perform specialized functions on our behalf, such as secure credit card processing and email service providers. They may have access to personal information needed to perform these functions but will be prohibited from using it for other purposes.
  4. **Protection of Us and Others.** We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or comply with legal process served on Groundspeak; or (b) protect and defend our rights or property, our services, users or the public.
  5. **Business Transfers.** In the unlikely event that we sell a portion of or all of our business or in the event that we reorganize, customer records would likely be transferred to the acquiring company or new entity; however, any personal information in those records will remain subject to the promises made in the pre-existing privacy policy.



### 4\. HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

Groundspeak has implemented many security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of your personal information. We protect your account information through the use of a password. To protect the confidentiality of your information you MUST keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. We also work to protect the security of your credit card information during transmission through the use of third party payment processors using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information you input. However, keep in mind that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.

### 5\. WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE?

  1. You can always choose not to provide information, even though it may be needed to use our services.
  2. You can add or update certain information by signing in to your account and accessing your profile/account details. 
  3. If you do not want to receive our newsletter or marketing communications from us, you can click the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the email you receive. This will not affect our ability to send you communications regarding your account. 
  4. If you do not want to receive emails from us about specific geocaches or Trackables, you can change your preferences by logging into your account and removing these geocaches and/or Trackables from your Watchlist or bookmarks. Please note that you cannot disable notifications related to geocaches or Trackables owned by you.
  5. If you have granted us access to your Facebook or Twitter account by linking, you can disconnect the link by logging into your account, accessing your profile and clicking the Facebook or Twitter icon to disconnect.



### 6\. HOW WE USE COOKIES

We use cookies and common automated data collection technologies, including web beacons, clear GIFs associated with cookies and Adobe Flash local shared objects, on our websites and applications, in order to provide certain services, such as logging a geocache, and to allow you to sign up for information from us.

We gather date, time, certain information about a user's browser and system or device configuration and capabilities, navigation history and IP address for all visitors to our websites. We use this information for our system administration and security and to gather general information about our audiences and their geographic locations.

**A. Our cookies.** We place cookies that identify you, or allow third parties to do so on our behalf, for the following purposes:

  1. to recognize you automatically when you return to our websites and mobile applications and to customize certain features and functions;
  2. to understand your interests in content, both our own content and that of other companies, on or across our websites and mobile applications;
  3. to make an automated record of your activities on our websites and mobile applications; and
  4. to manage, track and follow up on email campaigns.



We use Quantcast and Google Analytics cookies to track how groups or categories of users interact with our services.

You may use the tools in your browser to decline, disable, or delete any cookies. You will still be able to log on as a member if you decline or delete our persistent cookie that enables automatic recognition, but many important features of our websites will not be available, e.g. you will not be able to log a geocache if persistent cookies have been disabled. If you disable the session cookie for our websites, you may remain on the site but you will not be able to use Shop Geocaching and access certain other content.

**B. Third party advertising cookies.** We allow other companies to serve ads on our web pages. We do not control their use of cookies or other data collection technologies or practices. We currently allow Google AdSense to serve ads on our websites. Google uses other companies, such as PointRoll and Nielsen/Netratings to help it serve ads. Google and some of the companies it works with may offer additional choices about your preferences. Please visit the Google for more information about the technologies they use and their privacy practices. Google is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative. The NAI offers useful information about ad networks and a single place to turn off targeted ad serving from any of its members. We may add or change the list of third party advertisers from time to time without changing the effective date of the Privacy Policy itself. We urge you to check this section for changes regularly.

### 7\. HOW CAN YOU CHANGE OR DELETE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE HAVE?

Through the "Your Profile" tab on Geocaching.com, you can access "Account Details" to change or delete information yourself.

### 8\. WHAT CAN I DO IF MY CHILD HAS PROVIDED PERSONAL INFORMATION?

Our services are not intended for use by children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that personal information of someone less than 13-years-of-age has been collected through our services, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your minor child has obtained an account without your consent, then you may alert us [via email](http://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=request) and request that we delete that child's personal information.

### 9\. WHAT IF I DO NOT LIVE IN THE U.S.?

If you use our services outside of the United States, you understand and consent to the transfer of your personal information to, and the collection, processing and storage of your personal information in the United States. The laws on holding personal information in the United States may vary and be less stringent than laws of your state or country.

### 11\. THIRD PARTY LINKS
