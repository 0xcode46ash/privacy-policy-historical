# Privacy Policy

##  Privacy Policy 

**_  Effective November 2007 _**  


 

  Waypoint Outcomes LLC takes privacy seriously. 

We are committed to collecting as little personal information as possible and still offer full Waypoint functionality; we are committed to keeping secure all of the personal information we do collect; and we are committed to communicating personal information securely and only to those individuals at our client institutions who need to know it. Moreover, we proudly adhere to the principles of the EU/US Safe Harbor program. 

## Limited Collection of Personal Information

The only personal information we collect is the personal information we reasonably believe is absolutely necessary to provide our users with full Waypoint functionality. 

That information consists of first names, last names, email addresses, course management system usernames (only when our users access Waypoint through course management systems), unique student identification numbers (only when our users do not have email addresses), and the grades and feedback to student work created by instructors and/or reviewers using Waypoint. 

## Secure Data and Transmissions  


We store all personal information on servers at a location designed specifically to ensure that no unauthorized individuals have access to the server or its data.   
We restrict access to personal information to SubMet employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services.  
All transmissions of personal information between our users and Waypoint are SSL-encrypted.   
  

## Limited Purpose for Collecting Data 

We collect private data for only two reasons: To provide full Waypoint functionality to our users and to communicate that data to members of our client community who need to know it (e.g., We communicate to a faculty member the grades and feedback she created using Waypoint for the students in her course).

We do not sell, rent, lease, disclose or share personal information to any third party except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with the legal process, enforce our Terms of Use, respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties, or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of SubMet, its users, or the public. 

## Cookies 

We only use session cookies, which means no information is written to your hard drive and cookies disappear from computer memory when your browser is closed.    


## Access

Users have access to the personal information we collect about them. We are happy to correct, amend, or delete information that is inaccurate, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the user’s privacy, or where the rights of persons other than the user would be violated. 

## Contact Waypoint

Please contact us if you have any questions about our privacy policy or if you are concerned about how your personal data has been used. We take all concerns about privacy and use of data very seriously, and shall make every effort to respond quickly and appropriately.
