Privacy Statement

**Online Contributions:**

Federal law requires us to collect and report your name, address, employer, occupation, the amount of your contribution and your credit card number. We are required by federal law to collect and report the name, mailing address, occupation and name of employers of individuals whose contributions exceed $100 in a calendar year to the Federal Election Commission. These records are available to the public, however, they cannot be used by other organizations for fundraising. For additional information, visit the FEC website at [http://www.fec.gov](http://www.fec.gov/). We also make a note of your telephone number and email address if you choose to provide it, but you are not required to do so. By providing your telephone number and email address we can quickly contact you if follow up on your contribution is necessary under Federal election law.

In addition to the requirement to report contributions to the Federal Election Commission, we may exchange our contributor list with other organizations beginning in the year 2000. We may use information provided when you contribute online or when you download a form from our website and contribute by mail to contact you for the other purposes or to solicit you for additional contributions or support.

The State Party does use postal mailing lists it acquires from other organizations. If your name appears on one of these lists, you may receive non-electronic mailings from us. If you would like to be removed from our list, please contact us at (206) 583-0664 or email [unsubscribe@wa-democrats.org](mailto:unsubscribe@wa-democrats.org).
