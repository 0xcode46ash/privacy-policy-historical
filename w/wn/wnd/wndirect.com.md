# wnDirect :: Privacy Policy

[wnDirect Limited](https://web.archive.org/) ("wnDirect" or "us") is an international logistics company, providing parcel delivery services around the world.

This privacy policy, together with our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/terms-conditions.php) (together our "Terms") sets out how wnDirect handles the personal data that you share with us. You should read this privacy policy and Terms and Conditions carefully - by providing any information to us, you confirm that you have read and agree to these Terms.

For the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998, wnDirect is the data controller of the information that it processes for the purposes of providing its services.

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Please ensure you are familiar with the latest version of our privacy policy as that will apply to the personal data that you provide to us from the time at which we post such updated version on our website.

### What information do we collect?

We may require some or all of the following information in order to provide our services:

  * Name, address and contact details of sender;
  * Name, address and contact details of recipient;
  * Associated parcel and delivery information (e.g. signature of recipient);
  * Passport details (including number and issue date) for Russia; and
  * Customs-mandated information, including: 
    * National ID card details (number, issue date and front and rear images) for deliveries into China; and
    * CFP/Tax number for deliveries into Brazil.



Some or all of this information may be requested from you directly or obtained from a third party (e.g. the service provider from whom you have requested a parcel or package) (but in each case referred to in this privacy policy as personal data that you have provided or shared). If we do not receive all of the personal data that we request, we may not be able to (fully) provide the services that you require.

We may combine the personal information that you provide to us with information about your parcel/package (including reference number(s), shipping information and delivery confirmation (e.g. time/date stamp and signature of recipient)).

Altogether this information is 'personal data'.

By providing wnDirect with personal data about any other person (e.g. the recipient(s) of your parcels and packages), you confirm that you have their permission to do so for the purposes outlined in this privacy policy.

### What do we do with personal data?

wnDirect uses personal data to fulfil our parcel delivery services, which includes complying with local customs and import / export requirements.

We may also keep records of service information (about the sender and recipient and including information about the delivery) for accounting and customer service purposes.

We may share personal data with third parties, including our service providers and customs and other local authorities, for these purposes.

In addition, we may disclose personal data:

  * to a prospective purchaser or seller (if we buy or sell any business or assets);
  * if wnDirect or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party (in which case the personal data associated with the provision of wnDirect services may be one of the transferred assets); or
  * if we are under a duty to do so, including where required to: 
    * comply with any legal obligation;
    * enforce our Terms or any other agreements to which wnDirect is a party; or
    * protect the rights, property or safety of wnDirect, its customers or others.



### Data transfers

We may transfer and/or store your personal data outside of the EEA:

  * as necessary for the provision of our services (e.g. where there recipient is located outside of the European Economic Area); and
  * to our service providers based in the United States.



By providing personal data to us, you agree to us transferring such personal data in this way for the purposes outlined in this privacy policy.

### Data security

wnDirect endeavours to appropriately protect the personal data that it holds, including encryption where appropriate. Where you provide personal data to us electronically, please be aware that it is not completely secure and any such transmission is at your own risk.
