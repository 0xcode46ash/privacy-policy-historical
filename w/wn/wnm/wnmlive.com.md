In order to use the WNM Live Services, we need to associate your account with a geographic location. In order to do this, we will utilize the GPS and/or cellular antenna of your mobile device to find your approximate location. We may also utilize your IP Address to determine where you are. Your latitude and longitude coordinate pair will be utilized to determine the city and political region that you are currently in.

We are not in the business of selling any of your personal data to any other individual or company and such a sale would never take place.  We do not sell, rent, or lease our customer list to third parties, although we may sell, rent, or lease access to such users with the user's explicit permission. We may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, we may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to our company and users, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.  We also reserve the right to pass along all the data we have collected in the event of a merger or acquistion of our company in order to facilitate the continued operation of the service.

### Service Monitoring

During normal course of business our employees, sub-contractors, agents, and affiliates will never review your private communications or other personal data.  We do however reserve the right to do so when there is a clear and obvious need to do so.  An example of such a situation would be to verify reports of harrassment or to investigate service interuptions or issues.  In the event that it is neccessary to review private personal data, such data will only be viewed by individuals under a strict non-disclosure agreement with our company to protect disclosure beyond our company.
