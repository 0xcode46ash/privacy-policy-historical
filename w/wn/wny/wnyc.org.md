# WNYC - About WNYC

Visiting WNYC.org: When you visit our site, our Web server automatically recognizes only your domain name, where you are coming to us from and what browser you are using. We do not collect your e-mail address. We use this information to analyze how traffic flows at WNYC.ORG, but no one can contact or identify you from this information.

Bulletin Board Participation: We reserve the right to collect the e-mail addresses of those who post messages to our bulletin board, information volunteered by the user, such as survey information and/or site registrations. The information we collect is to ensure compliance with bulletin board rules and occasionally to alert members and visitors to opt-in to our e-mail newsletter but is never shared with other organizations for commercial purposes.

With respect to cookies: We use cookies to store visitors preferences, like the bulletin board password, but users have a choice of storing this password or typing the log-in with each visit.

E-mail Newsletters: WNYCMail is an opt-in e-mail newsletter that requires a separate registration process. Addresses for the newsletter are collected in the following ways:  
路 Through an online WNYCMail registration form  
路 Through phone-in pledges where the donor specifically requests to receive WNYCMail  
路 Through the secure e-pledge form  
路 Through online and call-in giveaways

If you do not want to receive e-mail from us in the future, please let us know by visiting the **[sign up page](https://web.archive.org/web/20030622121455id_/http%3A//wnyc.org/about/email_updates.html)** or call 212 669 3333.

Information WNYC.org Collects:  
If you supply us with your postal address on-line in conjunction with an e-pledge, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information on fundraising or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please let us know by e-mailing us at the above address.

Donors who supply us with their telephone numbers on-line will only receive telephone contact from us with information regarding on-line giving or technical queries. We use this information for customer service purposes only.

From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your personal information is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically.

Customers may prevent their information from being used for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected by calling us at the number provided.

With respect to security:   
When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information such as financial information, we redirect visitors to a secure state-of-the-art server. We have aggressive security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site.

The wnyc.org site encrypts all information entered in the secure e-pledge form. Information is encrypted using a Secure Socket Layer Certificate (SSL). The SSL protects all communications including credit card transactions and sensitive personal information. This ensures that hackers cannot detect passwords and encrypted information. The SSL Certificate will provide 128-bit-encryption as long as users are running 128-bit enabled browsers. 

WNYC.ORG links to a wide variety of other unaffiliated sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of those other sites or how they treat information about their users.
