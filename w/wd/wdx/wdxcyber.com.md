# Woman's Diagnostic Cyber Privacy Statement

## _**Privacy Statement**_

We want to provide a **trusted** on-line environment for you. We respect your privacy and want you to understand how we are using any information you present to us. 

Here is how we use your data at the Woman's Diagnostic Cyber: 

  * Upon your request, we will remove any of your personal information from our records or from our public forums. 
  * We will take reasonable security measures to restrict access to our systems that contain any of your information. 
  * We will not gather additional information about you by monitoring your communications in public forums. 
  * We do not share information about you including e-mail addresses with other people or companies. 
  * On the message board you do not have to leave your real name. Initials, firstname, screen name or "Call sign" will do. If you leave your email address when leaving a message, we only use it to send an email when our response is entered to let you know it is there. If you want to protect your email address from being "harvested" by automatic address grabbers (we haven't had a problem we know of), just put a hyphen in front of your email address. That way we and other message board users can contact you. 
  * Our email newsletter subscriber mailing list is **only** used for us to send you mail. This list is not released to anyone. 



If you have specific questions about how Woman's Diagnostic Cyber is using any of your information, please contact:
