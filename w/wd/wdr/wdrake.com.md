Below we describe why we gather information from our customers, what information we collect, how we collect it, what we use the information for and how you can instruct us if you prefer to limit the use of that information. 

Comments about our Privacy Policy may be sent by e-mail to 

[_help@wdrake.com_](mailto:help@wdrake.com). We can also be reached by telephone at 1-800-858-4979.

**_What information do we collect?_**   
When you shop with Walter Drake, online or through our catalogs, we collect the information necessary to process your transaction. This may include item, quantity ordered, name, address, city, state, zip code, telephone number, email address, and billing information (credit card or check account number, expiration date and billing address). When orders are shipped to an address different from the billing address, we will also ask for the name(s), full address(es) and phone number(s) of order recipients. Information you enter is collected even if you cancel or do not complete an order.

In addition when you visit online, our website automatically recognizes the address of your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and, in some cases, your domain name. We cannot identify you individually from your screen name if you are using America Online or one of the other major online services. Our website also identifies information such as your browser, your browser version, the operating system you are using, the pages you visit at wdrake.com and the uniform resource locator (URL) of where you were on the Internet if you clicked a link to 

[_www.wdrake.com_](http://www.wdrake.com/). 

How do we use the information we collect?   
We use the information collected for various purposes, including:   
* To process your transaction   
* To provide services as you request   
* To provide an enhanced and more personalized shopping experience   
* To mail our catalogs and other offerings.   
* To inform you of important information about your order   
* To identify products and services you prefer so that we can inform you of products, services, and promotions that may be of interest to you   
* To improve the merchandise selection available to you   
* To improve our customer service   
*To assure billing accuracy. 

We intend to continue improving the content and function of wdrake.com. For this reason, we gather the information mentioned above so that we can provide content of interest to you and a site that functions correctly on your computer system. 

In the event of a merger, consolidation, sale, or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets or business of wdrake.com (a "Successor"), one of the assets which would generally be transferred is the information we collect from our customers. However, the use of this information by any Successor would still be governed by the terms of this privacy policy, as amended from time to time, including any amendment after such transaction, and you will continue to have the right to opt-out of sharing your information with third parties. 

We may disclose any information you provide to wdrake.com (i) when we believe disclosure to be appropriate to comply with any law, regulation, or governmental request, or to comply with judicial process; or (ii) if such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to operate this web site or to process any purchases you make or conduct any promotions you participate in; (iii) to protect the rights or property of wdrake.com, its users, Sponsors, Providers, Licensors, or Merchants.

Should you choose to accept or subscribe to offers from third parties, we may pass your relevant personal information, including name and credit card number, to the third party whose offer you have accepted.

We do not use these devices for any other tracking activity.
