**What information do we collect?**  
Whenever you shop with Walter Drake, online or through our catalogs, we collect the information necessary to process your transaction. This may include item, quantity ordered, name, address, city, state, zip code, telephone number, e-mail address, and billing information (credit card or check account number, expiration date and billing address). When orders are shipped to an address different from the billing address, we will also ask for the name(s), full address(es) and phone number(s) of order recipients. Information you enter is collected even if you cancel or do not complete an order. 

In addition when you visit online, our server automatically recognizes the address of your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and, in some cases, your domain name. We cannot identify you individually from your screen name if you are using America Online or one of the other major online services. Our server also identifies your browser, your browser version, the operating system you are using, the pages you visit in The Walter Drake Store and the uniform resource locator (URL) of where you were on the Internet if you clicked a link to www.wdrake.com.
