# Privacy

((Title)) Privacy  
Welcome to our site ("Site"). To better protect your privacy, this notice explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used by Wunderman. 

Our Collection and Use of Information  
Wunderman may collect and store personally identifiable information about persons who visit this Site and voluntarily submit information in contacting us. Wunderman may also collect and store aggregate or anonymous information about user contact with and use of the Site. In addition, at times, we send your Web browser a "cookie," a small data file that's stored on your hard drive, to help us provide you with customized services. We do not use cookies to retrieve personal information from your computer. Information obtained in connection with the Site may be intermingled with and used by us in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than the Site, including both offline and online sources.

We may use the personal information we collect to contact you about our products and services or those of our clients or other third parties from time to time. In general, we do not sell your personally identifiable information to third parties or mass marketers. For example, we will not sell another company your name or email address. Unless you consent to the disclosure of your personally identifiable information, only we and our affiliates, our technical consultants, third party auditors and other third parties who make our Site available, enhance its functionality, or provide associated services have access to this information, and we require them to agree that they are covered by this policy. Please note that we do reserve the right to transfer your personally identifiable information and other information to our successors in business and purchasers of site assets.

We may use the aggregate or anonymous information we collect about our customers, traffic patterns, and related site information to better design our Site and to share with reputable third-party vendors.

Opt-out  
You may ask us to delete any information about you and cease further contact at any time by sending us a request marked "Privacy-Urgent", address as follows: [webmaster@wunderman.com](mailto:webmaster@wunderman.com).

Security  
We have a commitment to taking reasonable steps to ensure the security of your information. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put into place appropriate physical, and electronic procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

Children's Privacy  
Protecting the privacy of the young, i.e., children under the age of 13, is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our Site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our Site is structured to attract anyone under 13. If a child has provided us with personal information, we ask that a parent or guardian of the child contact us at [webmaster@wunderman.com](mailto:webmaster@wunderman.com) if they would like the information submitted by a child deleted from our database. We will use all reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.

Privacy Precautionary Warning Please note that no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of the information that you transmit via our online services.

Please note that we reserve the right to access and/or disclose the user information discussed herein (including personal information) as required by courts and/or administrative agencies and to the extent required to permit us to investigate suspected fraud, harassment or other violations of law or our Site Terms of Use or policies.

Consent  
By using our Site, you consent to the collection, use, and storage of your personal and non-personal information as described in this policy. You further authorize the export of personal information to the USA and its storage and use as specified in this policy when you provide such information to us. This policy and all legal obligations of WUNDERMAN are subject to the laws of New York and the USA, regardless of the location of any user. Any claims or complaints must be filed in the USA in the State of New York.

We may amend our Privacy Policy, but if we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page, so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it.

Safe Harbor  
Wunderman's privacy practices adhere to the Safe Harbor principles as certified by the U.S. Department of Commerce.
