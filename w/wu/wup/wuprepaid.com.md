" **Web beacons** " are transparent electronic images placed in the web code, also called "clear GIFs" or "web bugs" that collect non-personal data while visiting a web site. Your web browser usually has documentation on how to disable cookies and web beacons. This will limit the performance of Western Union's web site.

CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY We endeavor to maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to guard your Information.
