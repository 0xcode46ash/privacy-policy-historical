**Privacy**

I respect your privacy and I am committed to safeguarding your privacy while online at this site [w3m3 .com](http://w3m3.com/). The following discloses how I gather and disseminate information for this Blog.

Like most blogging platforms I use log files, in this case StatCounter. This stores information such as internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring, exit and visited pages, platform used, date/time stamp, track user’s movement in the whole, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Affiliate Disclosure**

This web site and blog uses affiliate programs for monetization, which means when you click on links (text, images and banners) to various sites that are recommended in the articles and posts and make a purchase, this can result in a commission that is credited to this site.

Some affiliate programs and affiliations include, but are not limited to, Clickbank.

I have thorough knowledge about the products I recommend through my articles and blog posts and promote them because to my opinion they provide value for money to the customers who purchase the products following my recommendations. But I will still advice all prospective customers to go through the sales copy of the vendors carefully before making any decision. However, all the products that are promoted through the site are protected by a Guaranteed Money Refund Policy offered by the vendors / sites selling the products.
