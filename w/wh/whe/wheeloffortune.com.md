**Information You Provide To Sony Card Marketing**

We may ask you to provide information that could reasonably be used to contact you or to identify you personally (such as first and last name, e-mail address and mailing address) (" **Personal Information** "). If you choose not to provide this information, you may not be able to participate in the Sony Rewards Program, the Sony Card Marketing Websites or a particular feature we offer. We may also ask you to provide other information about yourself, such as demographic information (such as gender, zip code, age, etc.) or payment information or certain information about your preferences and interests. If we combine demographic or other information we collect about you with Personal Information about you, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information. 

The Sony Rewards Program and Sony Card Marketing Websites are open only to individuals who are 13 years of age and older. If you are younger than 13 years of age, any information you submit will not be retained by Sony Card Marketing.

**Information Sony Card Marketing Collects Automatically**

In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to the Sony Card Marketing Websites, whenever you visit or interact with the Sony Card Marketing Websites or our content, Sony Card Marketing, as well as any third party analytics or other service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Websites are accessed and used (" **Usage Information** "). Usage Information may include, in part, browser type, operating system, the page served, the time, and the preceding page views. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if Sony Card Marketing associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we will treat it as Personal Information. 

Sony Card Marketing also automatically collects your IP address or other unique identifier (" **Device Identifier** ") for the computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively, " **Device** ") you use to access the Sony Card Marketing Websites. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a website or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third-party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the Device used to access the Websites.

The technologies used on the Sony Card Marketing Websites to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, include:

**Cookies.**  A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Sony Card Marketing Websites or otherwise access our online content. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages. If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the Site or our content may not function properly.

**Web Beacons**. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons, (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") may be included in the Sony Card Marketing Websites and our e-mail messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Websites, to monitor how users navigate the Websites, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to determine whether content sent was actually viewed.

**Embedded Scripts.**  An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Websites, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Websites, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.  
  
**Information We Receive From Third Parties **

Sony Card Marketing may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you choose to apply for a Sony branded credit or debit card or if you are a Sony branded credit card or debit card customer, we may receive information about you, from the issuing bank (currently, Capital One), which may include Personal Information as well as information regarding how you use the Sony branded credit card. In addition, if you are on another website and you opt-in to receive information from us, that website will forward to us your e-mail address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested. We may also supplement the information we collect about you with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We may combine the information we receive from these third parties with information we collect. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any Personal Information received, unless we have disclosed otherwise. ****

**Social Media Applications  
**

In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party web site give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections” or information about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections” web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party web site or interactive service.
