# WHERE Privacy Policy | WHERE™

**General Information:**

This Privacy Notice provides detailed information about the Where Services and the steps we take to protect your privacy.  We have compiled this policy to help you make informed decisions about your use of the Where Service and other uLocate properties. 

This Privacy Notice is subject to the Where Terms of Use. The personal information you provide to the Where Services as well as your use of the Where Services remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Notice and the Terms of Use.

Where Collects:  
Your Location Information: Where receives location information from your mobile carrier.  
Your Registration Information: When you subscribe to Where you are required to give us some “personally identifiable” information (mobile phone number, mobile carrier, name, email address, password, etc.).  
Cookies: Where uses cookies – small text files of a string of alphanumeric characters – to store some information and settings you may use during a visit to Where. Where uses two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies remain only for one visit. Persistent Cookies remain for subsequent visits, and can be deleted from your browser. To learn more about how to manage your cookies, please reference your browser’s “Help” section.  
Log Files: When you use Where Services, our servers automatically store Information about the request in a Log File.  This information may include, and is not limited to, client IP address, request date/time, query keywords, page or screen requested, HTTP code, bytes served, user agent, and referring website.  
Web Beacons: Where Services may employ “Web Beacons” (clear gifs)  to track User behavior anonymously.  Web Beacons store no personal information about you.

Where Uses Information:  
Where uses the information it collects (see above) to improve the Where Service and add features by analyzing trends in user behavior.  
Where uses cookies, Web Beacons, and log file information to remember user preferences and information you provide to Where, to provide custom content, to track marketing campaigns and, when applicable, to provide individualized advertising.  
Where DOES NOT spam. We will not give or sell your personally identifiable information (email, phone number, etc) to advertisers or third party developers for direct marketing purposes.  We may, however, use your email, should you allow us, to send newsletters.  In rare circumstances, we may use your email or phone to send you important notices about Where Service changes or outages.

Where Discloses Information When:  
We provide your personally identifiable information, location information and other non-personal information to affiliates, subsidiaries or other businesses to provide some Where Services.  Examples include, but are not limited to, billing arrangements for Where Services with your wireless carrier or providing maps and directions.   We may provide non-personal location information, consisting of a location coordinate with no other information, to third-party services but after you have given specific consent to do so.  
We provide non-personally identifiable information (such as information collected via Web Beacons and Log Files) to interested third-parties to assist those parties in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Where Services.  
In certain legally mandated situations or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws, we may release your personal or non-personal information. These situations may include and are not limited to responding to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant or to protect against liability, fraudulent or unlawful use or to enforce the Terms of Use.

Advertising:  
Where may share profile information and aggregate usage information in a non-personally identifiable manner to allow our advertising partners to present more targeted advertising, products and services. Our advertising partners may use technologies such as cookies to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. You should consult the respective privacy policies of our advertising partners since Where’s privacy policy does not apply to them.

Secure Data:  
Where takes many precautions to make sure that your account information is kept private. However, we cannot guarantee the security of member account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member information at any time.

Age:  
Children under the age of fourteen (14) are not eligible to use our service and must not submit any personal information to us.

International:  
The Where Services are hosted in the United States and are intended for North American visitors. If you are using the Where Services from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring your personal data to the United States and by providing your personal data you consent to that transfer.

Change in Ownership:  
We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer of ownership of Where, such as acquisition by or merger with another company. If an acquiring company should plan to materially change this privacy policy, we will notify you beforehand.

Changes to Policy:  
From time to time we may update this Privacy Policy and will post a notice of any significant changes on our website. You should visit this page periodically to review any such changes to the privacy policy. Your continued use of this website or our service and/or continued provision of personally identifiable information to us will be subject to the terms of the then-current Privacy Policy.
