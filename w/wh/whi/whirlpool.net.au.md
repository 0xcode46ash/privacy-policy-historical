 **Your privacy is important to us.**

WHIRLPOOL BROADBAND MULTIMEDIA will not disclose, sell, trade or rent any personally identifying information obtained from you for any purpose, to a third party without your prior consent. Extreme care is taken to ensure security of your private information both offline and online.

The term "Information" includes registration details, as well as statistics and preferential settings. It is our policy to allow our users to provide as much - or as little - personal information to us as they feel comfortable doing. 

It is however important to be aware that when you voluntarily provide personal information in an article reply or on the forums, that information will not be protected by this privacy policy (reasonable requests for deletion will usually be honoured however). For this reason, we discourage the offering of private details within the public commenting system.

 **What information do we gather?**

If you are comfortable providing us with information about yourself, enhanced services, like site customisation, become available to you. It is not possible for us to offer them to anonymous users.

All the information we gather is stored by WHIRLPOOL in a secure and separate area, protected by firewalls and never shared with anyone.

We use a feature of your browser called a "cookie" to assign a "User ID." Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out your identity or the identities' of any of our users, it only identifies your computer to our servers when you visit our site. The most noticeable benefit of this is not having to "log in" every time you visit.

Companies placing advertising on our sites may have the ability to assign a different cookie to you. However as these cookies are completely separate and don't identify you individually (you'll just be a number to them), companies will not know who you are - and we will certainly never tell them.

 **Why do we gather the Information?**

WHIRLPOOL aims to provide you with better services and more compelling reasons to come back and visit our sites. The information you provide us with personalise your experience, and provide just the information you are interested in receiving. We analyse what our users and customers like and don't like about the content, so that we can constantly improve them for your use.

WHIRLPOOL is committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect on our sites to make our services the best they can be and to enhance your overall experience. We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others.

 **Tell Us What You Think**

If you would like to comment or question anything you have read here, please do so by posting a [public comment](http://whirlpool.net.au/reply.cfm?id=49), or a private query via email at [privacy@whirlpool.net.au](mailto:privacy@whirlpool.net.au).

This privacy policy was erected in response to a particularly nasty commentary about Whirlpool.

 **For the record** , Whirlpool does not collect referrer data on an individual basis (I can not even access the HTTP logs, only summary data). The **only** 'stealth' data retained for each user is the date of last visit (to help weed out unused accounts), and your last IP (to investigate transparent proxy issues).

 **I am disappointed** about the level of immaturity shown by Josh Miles, with such presuppositions as _"the truth is that he is a snoop"_ , and completely incorrect claims such as _"This along with allot (sic) of other features that are built into the database and search your computer when you login"_. This site does **not** currently log referrers, colour depth, times of access, or browser type against your username, and certainly does not "search your computer" in any way.

 **It was even claimed** that 'evidence' was discovered of this, saying _"To give your an example of what I have found out about Whirlpool..."_ , as if it were actually true and not someone's creative imagination.

 **The replies shown below** indicate the public response to this issue, which has been cleared up, thanks to Dean Wilson who runs the great [Cableusers.com](http://www.cableusers.com/).
