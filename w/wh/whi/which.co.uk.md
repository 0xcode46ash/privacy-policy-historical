## Use of cookies

A cookie is a piece of text which is stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive.

A session cookie helps us analyse web traffic or lets us know when you visit a particular site.

We use the software of a third party company on our website to collect the data from a session cookie on our behalf.

We use a session cookie when you access any Which? website to track patterns of behaviour of visitors to our site, to build up marketing profiles and understand browsing patterns or if you purchase something via our Which? online shop because it enables us to speed up the buying process by allowing use of a shopping basket.

While our session cookies, by necessity, contain some personal information, such as your name, email address, preferences and whether or not you are a customer of Which?, they do not contain or store information relating to your financial/credit card details. The information that is collected by the session cookie will be used solely for tracking patterns of visitor behaviour to provide us with statistics and to identify groups of users to assist us in marketing our products and services.

If you log in as a subscriber and tick the ‘remember me’ box, we use a permanent cookie to store your username and password. This is so that you do not have to re-enter this information each time you return to which.co.uk. If you have ticked ‘remember me’ and then want to log out of which.co.uk, you will need to delete the cookie from your browser.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, though you can set most browsers to prevent this collection or access. Further information about cookies, including how to delete them, is available for [Internet Explorer](http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/c9daa36b-3bc0-47fa-aea1-5a250e2b4e561033.mspx) users, [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/options) users and [Safari](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Safari/2.0/en/ibr30.html) users or alternatively visit [allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) for more detailed advice on how to disable and enable cookies.
