## Links to Other Sites

This Web site may contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by WhiteFence. Please be aware that we, WhiteFence, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects Personally Identifiable Information, which may include, without limitation, when you leave our site to complete surveys or click on advertisements that direct you to third party sites. This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.

## Our Service Providers

It is our intention to maintain reputable service providers to offer residents a variety of products and services on our site. All services and products throughout our site are provided by third parties and are identified and described as such. When choosing to purchase products or services from any service provider, you must take into consideration that you will be transacting business directly with this service provider. The information provided by you and collected by a service provider will be similar to information that would be provided pursuant to a purchase of such product or service by telephone or in person.

## Cookies

We do not track or collect information about your visits to other Internet sites. Certain technical information is automatically collected about your computer each time you request a page during a visit to this site. This information may include your IP address, operating system and Web browser software (e.g., Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer). We assign you a "cookie" (i.e., a tiny packet of identifying information passed between your browser and a Web site) each time you visit this site. You do not provide this information; it is collected automatically as a means for supporting your visit to this site. This cookie does not contain any Personally Identifiable Information. You can always choose to not receive a cookie file by enabling your Web browser to refuse cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie. Please be aware that by refusing to accept a cookie you will not be able to make optimal use of this site. We use third-party advertising technology to serve ads when you visit Web sites upon which we advertise. This technology uses information about your visits to Web sites upon which we advertise (not including your name, address or other personal information) to serve our ads to you. In the course of serving our advertisements to you, a unique third-party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser. In addition, we use Web beacons, provided by our ad serving partner, to help manage our online advertising. These Web beacons enable our ad server to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits this site and to learn which banner ads bring users to our Web site. The information we collect and share through this technology is not personally identifiable. We also allow third-party ad companies, including other ad networks, to display advertisements on our sites. In some cases, these third parties may collect information about you and your online activities through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies in an effort to understand your interests and deliver advertisements to you that are tailored to your interests. These third parties may offer you a way to opt-out of receiving targeted ads. For example, some of these companies are members of the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) or the [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/), which each provide you with a way to opt-out of ad targeting from participating companies. We also use a third-party tracking service called Omniture that uses cookies to track non-Personally Identifiable Information about visitors to our site in order to track our visitor page views and clicks within our site for the purposes of gaining a better understanding of visitor preferences, improving the relevance and quality of our site, and other purposes we deem appropriate.

## Use of Your Personally Identifiable Information

Personally Identifiable Information collected on this site may be used to:

  * Facilitate your orders for services and products
  * Send notifications
  * Promote our service and other available services and products
  * Respond to your questions or suggestions
  * Improve the quality of our site



## Ordering Products and Services

Information collected when you order a product or service is used to confirm and process that order, and may be reused to assist with the processing of your orders of other products and services. For example, if you desire to purchase multiple products and services using the same credit card, you will be able to submit your purchase orders without retyping your credit card information each time. In addition, information collected from you when you order products or services is used to process the billing and payment for these services through your credit card or automatic deduction (electronic funds transfer) account, if applicable. If you set up an ongoing billing and payment account with any of our service providers, these ongoing (usually monthly) charges to your credit card or automatic deduction account will be billed and collected directly by the service provider.

## Notifications and Promotions

Service providers that you select may use your e-mail address or telephone number to contact you in order to confirm or arrange service appointments, answer questions or provide requested information, or to resolve outstanding issues pertinent to the delivery of products or services ordered by you. We and your selected service providers may use your e-mail address or other contact information to send you notifications about new features, products, services, specials, service providers, promotions or other opportunities available through this site, or to confirm or improve customer service. You will have the opportunity upon the receipt of any promotional e-mails not pertaining to the status of any of your orders to unsubscribe from receiving such promotional e-mails in the future. We may share address information with our service providers or other business affiliates to provide you with information about new products or services, special offers, discounts or other information that may be of interest to you.

## Opt In Policy

We will not share your Personally Identifiable Information in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement unless you specifically elect to make your Personally Identifiable Information available to third parties by checking the applicable opt in box or boxes located on our site.

We may collect information about your computer (IP address, operating system and Web browser software) for the purpose of assessing the effectiveness of site content and traffic. This data allows us to improve the quality of your visit by streamlining your ability to navigate the site. We do not track your IP address or collect information about your visits to other Internet sites. Information about you and your use of this site may be aggregated with other information collected on this site or other sites or otherwise used in ways that do not personally identify you or constitute Personally Identifiable Information.

## Service Providers

When you order a product or service, we deliver Personally Identifiable Information provided by you, including payment information, to the service provider that you selected to provide you with such product or service. Our service providers will require certain information about you, including applicable billing and payment information, in order to fulfill your purchase order or service initiations. When you purchase a product or service, you are contracting directly with the applicable service provider offering the purchased product or service. We provide the forum for and facilitate the processing of your orders. The applicable service provider will be responsible for the fulfillment, delivery, billing, customer service, warranty and support of its own products and services. We recommend that you examine the privacy policies of all third parties from which you purchase products and services, whether through our site, by telephone, in person or by other means, to understand their procedures for using and disclosing your Personally Identifiable Information.

We may also from time to time provide you with information about products or services, special discounts and other information regarding our sites. You will have the opportunity upon the receipt of any promotional e-mails not pertaining to the status of any of your orders to unsubscribe from receiving such promotional e-mails in the future.

## Site Partner

A Site Partner will not have access to your credit card or automatic deduction account information, or other sensitive data that you may provide to service providers, such as your social security number, unless you provide such information to the Site Partner through other means. We may share information with a Site Partner regarding your use of this site and the products and services that you purchase from our service providers. Organizations and other persons interested in becoming channel partners or service providers of WhiteFence are requested to provide certain personally identifiable information, such as name, type of organization, address and contact information.

We may also disclose information about someone who poses a threat to our interests (such as customer fraud) or whose activities could damage or bring harm to others.

In some cases where we post the notice we will also e-mail users, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
