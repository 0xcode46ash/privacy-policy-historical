These policies are in addition to ninemsn's general Terms of Use governing the Network and should be read in conjunction with such Terms of Use. 

Please note that separate policies apply to the use of sites that are available through the Network but are not operated by ninemsn directly. Also, any information that you provide under services provided by Microsoft through our site are governed by specific Microsoft privacy policies. Those policies can be found on specific MSN sites including: [Hotmail](http://www.hotmail.msn.com/cgi-bin/dasp/hminfo_shell.asp?_lang=&beta=&in=yes&content=pstate), [Passport](http://passport.com/privacypolicy.asp) and [LinkExchange](http://www.linkexchange.com/privacy.html).

.......................................................................................................................................1\. Your personal information is important to us  
Ninemsn recognises that your privacy is very important to you and that you have a right to control your personal information. We know that providing personal information is an act of trust and we take that seriously. Unless you give us explicit consent to act otherwise, the following policies will govern how ninemsn handles your personal information and safeguards your privacy.  
.......................................................................................................................................2\. Ninemsn is committed to the best-practice privacy standards  
Ninemsn is committed to protecting your personal information and giving you choice in who can use your personal information and how it can be used. We believe that our privacy policy represents industry best practice. Ninemsn is a member of the Internet Industry Association, which is developing a [Code](http://www.iia.net.au/code.html) which provides a high standard of privacy protection. Ninemsn is already committed to complying with this Code, and is committed to complying with the voluntary National Principles for the Fair Handling of Personal Information developed by the Australian Federal Privacy Commissioner in 1998 [see the [Australian Privacy Commissioner's](http://www.privacy.gov.au/private/index.html) website]. Ninemsn will comply with any laws introduced to strengthen protections for consumers' privacy.  
.......................................................................................................................................3\. Collecting information about you  
Ninemsn will not collect or monitor any personal information about you without your consent unless we believe it is necessary: 

  * Because it is required by law. 
  * To provide you with a service which you have requested. 
  * To implement our terms of service. 
  * To protect the rights or property of ninemsn, any ninemsn user, or any member of the public. 
  * To lessen a serious threat to a person's health or safety.



You may provide ninemsn with information directly, such as through subscribing to email lists or identifying yourself when using particular services. The amount of information we collect about you depends on how you use the sites on our Network. The only personal information we collect is what you tell us about yourself, for example by subscribing to the Getaway Travel Club, email updates on various sites such as News, Sunday and Small Business, or putting yourself on the mailing list for the Sports Shop. This information is not currently combined between different sites on the Network. 

Ninemsn uses cookies to help maximise your enjoyment of our Network. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's browser. Please see further information on how we use cookies below. 

Ninemsn intends to introduce a membership system that will give you the option of enjoying enhanced services on our Network. Again, any changes in how we use your personal information will only occur with your consent. 

Any further collection of your personal information than that explained above will only occur with consent from you. Ninemsn only collects information from your use of our Network and not from other organisations.  
  
.......................................................................................................................................4\. Our use of cookies  
Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies. However, if you do not wish to receive any cookies you may set your browser to refuse cookies. In some instances this may mean you will not be able to take full advantage of parts of the Network. 

The use of cookies can enhance your enjoyment of what is offered by ninemsn, because they can help personalise your experience of our website. They can make it easier for you to shop online and can ensure that information provided to you is most relevant to your interests. Cookies can also provide us with aggregate information on how people use our websites, and which advertisements are effective, which helps us to keep improving our Network. 

Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's browser. The cookies simply operate as a unique identifier which help us to know what our customers find interesting and useful on our website, almost like a continuing questionnaire. We do not link this information back to other information that you have provided to us. Ninemsn does not store any information inside cookies. 

ninemsn uses Engage Technologies to manage advertising on the Network and provide aggregate information on the use of our website. Engage Technologies uses cookies to build anonymous profiles which can be used by websites to tailor their content, promotions and advertising and perform anonymous market research. We do not allow Engage Technologies to collect any personally identifiable information, nor is the information ever merged with personal information such as your name, address or email address, or any information that is considered sensitive or would compromise your privacy. We do not believe that the Engage cookies pose any threat to your privacy, however at any time you can still opt out of having any information on your use of our site collected. For more information on Engage, including how you can opt out of anonymous profiling, go to [www.engage.com](http://www.engage.com/). To opt out, go to [www.engage.com/privacy/koptout.htm](http://www.engage.com/privacy/koptout.htm).  
  
.......................................................................................................................................5\. Using and disclosing your personal information  
Ninemsn will not use or disclose any information about you without your consent, or access your communications on our websites, unless: 

  * Required by law. 
  * We believe it necessary to provide you with a service which you have requested. 
  * To implement our terms of service. 
  * To protect the rights or property of ninemsn, any ninemsn user, or any member of the public. 
  * To lessen a serious threat to a person's health or safety.



Ninemsn and its affiliates recognise the trust you place in us when you give us personal information. In order to operate the website or deliver a service we may sometimes share your personal information with an affiliate or with a service partner (such as Microsoft, which operates the Passport service). We will not otherwise disclose your personal information to other companies without your explicit consent.  
  
.......................................................................................................................................6\. "Spam" (promotional email)  
We will not send you "spam" (advertising information) without first asking you whether you wish to have promotional information sent to you. If you are receiving promotional information about ninemsn or its affiliates and do not wish to receive this information any longer, you may remove your name from our list either by visiting the website from which the communication was sent and following the instructions on how to withdraw your information from that site (where that facility is available), or emailing us at [privacy@ninemsn.com.au](mailto:privacy@ninemsn.com.au) and asking to be removed from our mailing list. Please allow seven days for this request to be processed. 

**Hotmail customers**  
If you are receiving unsolicited emails from within your Hotmail account, or would like to enquire about how to protect yourself online, please view our support page on this topic: <http://ninemsn.com.au/support/hotmail/junkmail.asp>. 

For more information please read [Hotmail's privacy policy](http://www.hotmail.msn.com/cgi-bin/dasp/hminfo_shell.asp?_lang=&beta=&in=yes&content=pstate).  
  
.......................................................................................................................................7\. Storage and security of your personal information  
Ninemsn will endeavour to take all reasonable steps to keep secure any information which we hold about you, and to keep this information accurate and up to date. Your information is stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities. Where an MSN service is provided from overseas, such as Hotmail and Passport, your folder is kept in secure databases and is protected by MSN's security policies. In addition, our employees and data processors are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by ninemsn. However, ninemsn will not be held responsible for events arising from unauthorised access to your personal information. 

You can also play an important role in keeping your personal information secure, by maintaining the confidentiality of any password and accounts used on the ninemsn website. Please notify us immediately if there is any unauthorised use of your account by any other Internet user or any other breach of security.  
  
.......................................................................................................................................8\. Ninemsn and links to other websites  
Ninemsn provides links to websites outside of the ninemsn service. These linked sites are not under the control of ninemsn, and we are not responsible for the conduct of companies linked to our website. Before disclosing your personal information on any other website, we advise you to examine the terms and conditions of using their websites.  
.......................................................................................................................................9\. What to do if you have a problem or question  
If ninemsn becomes aware of any ongoing concerns or problems with sites on our Network, we will take these issues seriously and work to address these concerns. If you have any further queries relating to our privacy policy, or you have a problem or complaint, please contact us at [privacy@ninemsn.com.au](mailto:privacy@ninemsn.com.au).  
.......................................................................................................................................10\. Future changes  
Our commitment to make ninemsn Australia's leading Web network means that we are constantly adding new sites and features to the Network. Because of this, from time to time, our policies will be reviewed and may be revised. Ninemsn reserves the right to change its privacy policy at any time and notify you by posting an updated version of the policy on its website.  
.......................................................................................................................................11\. Specific conditions: ninemsn sites  
These principles apply generally to the ninemsn Network. However, some ninemsn sites such as ninemsn Jobs (Seek) are operated jointly with other reputable organisations. These sites may have special terms and conditions that differ from these and may affect the handling of your personal information. Please check these when using these sites. In a situation where these privacy principles and the specific terms and conditions of a ninemsn website differ, the specific terms will prevail.
