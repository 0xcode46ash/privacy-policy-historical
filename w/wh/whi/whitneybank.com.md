Personal information may be requested if the visitor chooses to respond to online surveys, sends Whitney Bank an e-mail message, applies for products and services online, or uses Whitney Bank's e-Banking Services. 

**E-mail and Product Inquiry**  
Through use of a "Contact Us" feedback form, Whitney Bank invites visitors on its Web sites to send e-mail messages to Whitney Bank so that Whitney Bank may respond to inquiries regarding Whitney Bank or its products or services.

If Whitney Bank thinks that a particular Whitney Bank account or service might apply to you or serve your needs, then Whitney Bank may occasionally contact you at your e-mail address to inform you of the potential benefits and availability of such accounts or services.

A customer can tell whether a document comes from a secure server by looking at the location (URL) field. If the URL begins with https:// (instead of http://), the document comes from a secure server. After you have submitted an application online, Whitney Bank recommends that you end your browser session before leaving your computer.

You can also help maintain the security of your banking information by not sharing your ID or password with anyone, by changing your password regularly, and by remembering to sign off.
