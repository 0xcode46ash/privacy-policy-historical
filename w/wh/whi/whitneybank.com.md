Statement on Privacy of Customer Information

Recognition of a Customer's Expectation of Privacy **  
**

Since 1883, Whitney has recognized and respected the privacy expectations of our customers and we understand our responsibility to treat customer information in an appropriate and confidential manner.

Use, Collection and Retention of Customer Information **  
**

We collect, retain and use information about individual customers only where we reasonably believe it would be useful (and allowed by law) to administer our business and to provide products, services and other opportunities to our customers.

Maintenance of Accurate Information **  
**

We strive to assure that information we maintain is accurate, current and complete in accordance with reasonable commercial standards. We have established procedures to respond to requests to correct inaccurate information in a timely manner.

Limiting Employee Access to Information **  
**

Employee access to personally identifiable customer information is limited to those with a business reason for knowing such information. Whitney employees are governed by a code of conduct that includes the responsibility to protect the confidentiality of customers' financial and other information. We take appropriate disciplinary measures to enforce employee privacy responsibilities.

Protection of Information through Established   
Security Procedures **  
**

We maintain appropriate security standards and procedures to guard against unauthorized access to customer information.

Restrictions on the Disclosure of Customer Information **  
**

We do not reveal specific information about customer accounts or other personally identifiable data to unaffiliated third parties for their independent use, except for the exchange of information with reputable information reporting agencies to maximize the accuracy and security of such information or in the performance of bona fide corporate due diligence, unless 1) the information is provided to help complete a customer initiated transaction; 2) the customer requests it; or 3) the disclosure is required by/allowed by law (e.g., subpoena, investigation of fraudulent activity, etc.).

Maintaining Customer Privacy in Business   
Relationships with Third Parties **  
**

When we provide personally identifiable customer information to third parties who provide services on our behalf to our customers, such as the vendor that prints our customers' checks, we insist that the third party adhere to similar privacy principles that provide for keeping such information confidential and using the information only for the provision of the intended service.

Disclosure of Privacy Principles to Customers **  
**

We shall make information regarding our privacy policies available to our customers in order to create a better understanding of our treatment of this important issue.
