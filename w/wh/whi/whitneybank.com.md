# Privacy Policy

Since 1883, Whitney has recognized and respected the privacy expectations of our customers. We understand our responsibility to treat customer information in an appropriate and confidential manner.

Whitney's Privacy Promise to all Customers **  
**

| We collect and retain information only when we need it to serve you and manage our business. |   
---|---|---  
| We restrict the disclosure of your information. |    
| We strive to assure the accuracy of your information. |    
| We limit employee access to your information. |    
| We have established security measures to protect your information. |    
  
We collect and retain information only when we need   
it to serve you and manage our business **  
**

As we establish and develop relationships with our customers, we collect and retain nonpublic personal information about them from a variety of sources, such as:

|  | Information we receive from you on applications or other forms, such as your name, address, social security number, assets, and income; |   
---|---|---|---  
  |   | Information about your transactions with a Whitney company or others, such as your account balance, payment history, parties to transactions, and credit card usage; and  |    
  |   | Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency, such as your creditworthiness and credit history. |    
  
We restrict the disclosure of your information **  
**

We do not reveal information about current or former customers to anyone, except as disclosed in this policy or as permitted or required by law.

Within the Whitney family of companies, we share certain customer information to improve our service to you. For example, the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act authorizes us to share \- among Whitney companies - information about our transactions and experiences between you and any Whitney company. In addition, certain Whitney companies that are financial services providers, such as Whitney Securities, LLC, a securities brokerage firm, can improve their service to you by sharing additional information with other Whitney companies. This additional information includes information provided as a part of applications, obtained from third parties, or received from consumer reporting agencies. Before you become a customer of a Whitney company desiring to share this additional information, we will give you the opportunity to direct that we not share this information. Otherwise, we do not share any nonpublic personal information about our current or former customers among Whitney companies, except as permitted by law. 

In addition to arrangements among Whitney companies, we contract with unrelated companies, such as non-financial companies, to support our business operations (check printing, data processing or marketing assistance are examples). We may disclose all of the information we collect as described above to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing arrangements, including insurance companies. We insist on contract provisions requiring these companies to follow high standards for safeguarding customer information. Of course, we prohibit these third parties from using your information for any purpose other than fulfilling our contracts with them.

We disclose customer information under several other, limited circumstances. These include disclosures we make to reputable information reporting agencies, such as credit bureaus, or to persons calling to confirm whether a customer's check is good. We also disclose information as permitted or required by a number of federal and state laws, such as in response to subpoenas, garnishments and other legal process.

Finally, from time to time Whitney may sell a line of business or a portfolio of products (such as student loans or certain mortgage loans). Whitney reserves the right to disclose customer information relating to these assets to prospective purchasers to aid them in making their offers and to the ultimate purchaser.

Other than described above, Whitney does not disclose customer information to anyone else outside of the Whitney corporate family unless our customer has asked or permitted us to do so.

We strive to assure the accuracy of your information **  
**

We strive to assure that information we maintain is accurate, current and complete in accordance with reasonable commercial standards. We have established procedures to respond to requests to correct inaccurate information in a timely manner.

We limit employee access to your information **  
**

We have a comprehensive written code of conduct governing all employees, which includes provisions to protect the confidentiality of customer information. In addition, we restrict access to nonpublic personal information to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you or to manage our business.

We have established security measures to   
protect your information **  
**

We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information. Information on Whitney's Internet security measures can be obtained on our web site at: [www.whitneybank.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20010606021758id_/http%3A//www.whitneybank.com/index.asp).
