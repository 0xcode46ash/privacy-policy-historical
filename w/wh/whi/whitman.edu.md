**Web privacy advocates**  
Whitman College is dedicated to fair information practices on this internet site and periodically reviews and revises its privacy practices. If you have questions or concerns about this privacy statement or Whitman's privacy practices, please contact the [Office of Communication](mailto:communication@whitman.edu). 

**Information collection and use**  
Whitman College is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Information may be collected for admission application deposits, online admission applications, address updates, bookstore ordering information, online gifts to the college, topical surveys, and for other uses relevant to the College and its constituencies.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of information placed on the user's hard drive by a web site containing information about the user or the user's selections on a web page. Unlike many commercial sites, usage of a cookie on our web site is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information after you leave our site. Once users close their browsers, the cookie simply terminates. By setting a cookie on our site, the user does not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Users may set cookie security levels to accept or reject cookies by configuring their browser software appropriately. 

**Log files**  
We use internet protocol (IP) addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. (An IP address is a 32-bit number that identifies each sender or receiver of information and is sent in packets across the Internet. See [Whatis.com's definition of IP Address](http://searchwebmanagement.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid27_gci212381,00.html) for further information.) IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. Certain addresses are also provided access to campus-only intranet materials. 

**Sharing of information**  
We use outside shipping companies to deliver bookstore orders, and credit card processing companies to bill users for goods and services. 

**Links**  
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Whitman College is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the whitman.edu web site. 

**Surveys**  
From time to time our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to provide this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and address), demographic information (such as zip code, age level), in addition to other information collection relevant to the College and its academic programs.

**Security**  
This web site uses a variety of precautions to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, that information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or Whitman ID), that information is encrypted when using the hypertext secure server mode (https). While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, when you are just "surfing." To learn more about SSL, read [Verisign's Overview of SSL](http://www.verisign.com/clientauth/kit/details.html#sslover). 

While we use secure socket layer encryption (SSL) to protect sensitive information online, we also protect user-information off-line. Our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a bookstore service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Additionally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

If you have any questions about the security at our web site, you can send an email to [webteam@whitman.edu](mailto:webteam@whitman.edu).

**Correcting or updating personal information**  
If a person's personal information (such as address or phone number) changes we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, or update that user's personal data. Send corrections to [Whitman Webteam](mailto:webteam@whitman.edu).

**How to contact us with questions or comments**  
You can reach us through one of the following [contacts](https://web.archive.org/web/20031002231040id_/http%3A//www.whitman.edu/pieces/comments.html) or through the [Office of Communication](mailto:communication@whitman.edu).
