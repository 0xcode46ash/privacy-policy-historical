## How do we collect your personal information?

WhistleOut will only collect Personal Information where the information is necessary for WhistleOut to perform one or more of its functions or activities. In this context, "collect" means gather, acquire or obtain by any means, information in circumstances where the individual is identifiable or identified.

Where possible, we collect your personal information directly from you. If you feel that the information that we are requesting, either from our website (www.whistleout.com.au) or our sub domains', or in our discussions with you, is not information that you wish to provide, please feel free to raise this with us.

WhistleOut collects Personal Information primarily to refer you to suppliers of products and services from companies listed on https://www.whistleout.com.au/ or a sub domain. This is a free and completely optional service. We will collect at a minimum: 

  * name of the contact person;
  * email address and phone number; and
  * nature of the products and services being sought from the supplier.



WhistleOut will notify individuals (including, but not limited to, our customers) of the matters listed below before collecting any Personal Information:

  * the organisations or types of organisations to whom we usually Disclose the Personal Information including Related Bodies Corporates and contractors;
  * the consequences (if any) for the individual if all or part of the Personal Information is not provided to WhistleOut.



Importantly, the use of any information you provide to WhistleOut which forms part of your enquiry with a third party is not within the control of WhistleOut. A copy of your personal information will be stored by WhistleOut and is subject to WhistleOut's privacy policy. Any referral which is passed by WhistleOut to third party is also subject to the third party's privacy policy.

You are not obliged to give us your Personal Information. If you would like to access any of our services or features of our website on an anonymous basis we will take reasonable steps to comply with your request. If at any time you provide personal information about anyone other than yourself, you warrant to us that you have that person's consent to provide such information for the purpose specified.

We do not collect Sensitive Information about you unless it is necessary and we have your consent or it is required by law or in accordance with the Act. Sensitive Information (if collected) is obtained through your use of our website or related means.

Other information is collected by automated methods. Other Information we collected may include:

  * the Internet Protocol address and a component of the domain name used (e.g. .com or .net);
  * the type of browser and operating system you used;
  * the date and time you visited our website;
  * the web pages or services you accessed at our website;
  * the time spent on individual pages and our website overall; or
  * information about your computer and Internet connections using cookies.



We have integrated Google Analytics into our website (see https://www.google.com/analytics/ for details). This enables the collection of data about traffic on our website via a DoubleClick cookie in addition to data collected through the standard Google Analytics implementation. We may as part of the use of Google Analytics functionality switch on Display Advertising which enables features that are not available through standard implementations. This includes Remarketing , Google Display Network Impression Reporting, DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting , each as described by Google.

Importantly, we will not facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information previously collected from Display Advertising features that is based on the DoubleClick cookie unless we have given you notice of, and have your prior affirmative (i.e., opt-in) consent to, that merger. Using Ads Settings, visitors to our website can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customise Google Display Network ads. A Browser opt-out is available at: <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/>. We use Google Analytics to obtain a more detailed understanding of our our website users and their potential needs. Data collected from such reports may be used to more accurately target marketing and advertising campaigns based on demographic information and more generally for the Primary Purpose and secondary purposes detailed in this Policy. We do not collect data on individuals by such methods; only aggregate data is used for planning purposes.

  * a free and completely optional service to refer you to the supplier of the products and services that you requested;
  * to provide you with further information about the products and services you requested;
  * to personalise and customise your experiences with WhistleOut;
  * to help WhistleOut to review, manage and enhance its services;
  * to develop insights used in reports or other content developed by WhistleOut; and
  * to communicate with you



If you go to a third party's website via WhistleOut to complete a purchase, all information required by the seller of the product is collected from you, by the seller, using application forms on their site or via email phone (as relevant) and not collected by WhistleOut.

For example, WhistleOut provides an optional enquiry form on a range of financial and telecommunications products which is passed directly to WhistleOut's supplier listed in the enquiry form. The supplier and product will be clearly identified in the enquiry form and the personal information submitted in the form will be used by the supplier to provide a personalised follow up call about your requirements. The personal information that you submit in this enquiry form is subject to the terms and conditions of this privacy policy. Enquiries in this category are only submitted to WhistleOut's supplier for the purposes of follow up on tour request and are not used by any third party partners in other categories.

In addition to the Primary Purpose, we may use the Personal Information we collect and you consent to WhistleOut using your Personal Information to:

  * provide individuals with relevant advertisements and relevant information about promotions, as well as the products and services of WhistleOut and other organisations;
  * send you marketing and promotional material that you may be interested in;
  * communicate with you, including by email, phone and mail;
  * manage and enhance products or your experience on our website and the sub domains of WhistleOut;
  * conduct surveys or promotions;
  * verify your identity;
  * investigate any complaints about, or made by you, or if we have reason to suspect you have breached any relevant terms and conditions; or
  * as required or permitted by any law.



We will not use your personal information for any purpose for which you would not reasonably expect us to use your personal information. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information that we hold is accurate and up-to-date. If you feel that information about you is not accurate or your details have or are about to change, you can email us at privacy@whistleout.com and we will correct or update your personal information.

* * *

## What happens if you choose not to provide your personal information?

You are not obliged to give us your personal information. Most of our services are available on an anonymous basis. Where we do require personal information and you would like to access any of these services on an anonymous basis we will take all reasonable steps to comply with your request. However, if you choose not to provide WhistleOut with personal details, such as your name or email or phone number, the range of options available to you, may be limited.

For example, WhistleOut provides a function that allows you to request a call back, from a supplier of a service, listed on the website. Without a phone number or email we cannot successfully deliver this service.

* * *
