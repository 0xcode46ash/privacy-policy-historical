The Policy describes:

  * The information we collect and how we collect it;
  * What we do with the information we collect;
  * Information sharing and disclosure;
  * How you can access and update your information;
  * How we protect information;
  * Linked sites and advertisements;
  * Users from outside the United States;
  * Children;
  * How to contact us;
  * Your California privacy rights;
  * No rights of third parties; and
  * Changes to this policy.



**The Information We Collect and How We Collect It**

How we collect and store information depends on the Whiskey Riff Services you use and the devices you use to access the Whiskey Riff Services. You can use some of the Whiskey Riff Services without providing any information other than that automatically collected as described below.

We may collect information about you during your use of the Whiskey Riff Services, including your name, username, password, email address, and information you provide or post on the Whiskey Riff Services or allow us to access when you do certain things, such as:

  * Enter registration information for the Whiskey Riff Services;
  * Enter a sweepstakes or contest or register for a promotion;
  * Participate in voting or polling activities;
  * Request certain features (e.g., newsletters);
  * Sign up to receive SMS (text message) notifications;
  * Download or use one of our mobile applications;
  * Connect with the Whiskey Riff Services or otherwise allow us to access certain information about you via Facebook and other social networking services (collectively, “social networking services”); or
  * Post content to or on the Whiskey Riff Services.



We may collect and store your user ID associated with the social networking site account that you use to sign in to your Whiskey Riff account or connect or use with the Whiskey Riff Services. When you sign in to your Whiskey Riff account or mobile application with your social networking site account information or otherwise connect to your social networking site account with the Whiskey Riff Services, you authorize Whiskey Riff to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information available to Whiskey Riff through the social networking site interface, including any information that you have made public in connection with your social networking site account, information that the social networking site shares with us, or information that is disclosed as being shared during the sign-in process.

We may also combine information that we collect from you with information we obtain about you from third parties and information derived from any other service we provide.

Please be careful whenever you are online. Should you choose to voluntarily disclose information through the Whiskey Riff Services, such as via social networking sites or in comments you post, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge.

**Cookies and Other Electronic Technologies**

When you use the Whiskey Riff Services, we use persistent and session cookies and other tracking technologies to: (a) store your username and password; (b) analyze the usage of the Whiskey Riff Services; (c) customize the Whiskey Riff Services to your preferences; and (d) control the advertising displayed by the Whiskey Riff Services. We may also use other Internet technologies, such as Flash technologies, Web beacons or pixel tags, and other similar technologies, to deliver or communicate with cookies and track your use of the Whiskey Riff Services (including serving you ads when you are on other websites or the Internet when we can access those cookies). We also may include Web beacons in e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether the message has been opened. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather additional information through other methods.

We use these automated technologies to collect and analyze certain types of information we consider to be non-personal information, including: (a) information related to the devices you use to access or interact with our services, such as: IP addresses, geolocation information (as described further below), unique device identifiers and other information about your mobile phone or other mobile device(s), browser types, browser language; and (b) information related to the ways in which you interact with the Whiskey Riff Services, such as: referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time you used the Whiskey Riff Services, and other similar information. We may also capture other data, such as search criteria and results. In some cases, we will associate this information with a unique Whiskey Riff identifier (that cannot be used by it to identify you) for our internal use, in which case your Whiskey Riff identifier will be considered Whiskey Riff information and nothing in this Privacy Policy restricts how Whiskey Riff may use this information.

Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies by visiting the Help portion of your browser’s toolbar. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in, customize, or use some of the interactive features of the Whiskey Riff Services. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser will not remove flash cookies. To learn more about how to manage flash cookies, you can visit the [ **Adobe website**](http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html) and make changes at the [ **Global Privacy Settings Panel.**](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html)

**Third Party Advertising and Your Choices**

Third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Whiskey Riff Services may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect non-personal information about your use of the Whiskey Riff Services. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers) to serve tailored ads to you on the Whiskey Riff Services, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Whiskey Riff Services. We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Whiskey Riff Services by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below. You may receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the [ **Network Advertising Initiative’s website**](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices) and/or the [ **Digital Advertising Alliance’s website**](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). You also can control advertising cookies from Google, by using its [ **Ads Preference Manager**](https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/?sig=ACi0TChRwpbntAMM2njihdXfozJJeFxAHpjCee18n5ZUFrx0f8Ag81ZmI54vN5AJDgezZbJiXkYJzMoIPZZ5IrzDPFotiE02HNJqcwNz6mqlWRRkiULVCbvp_56vm0MKiu_uNlIoIfHLZNZk4nM3PMRYKe24CwR6JlanqGrd1kJrWrKSpv82qlzOgEH_yTJ2vTcw2LO912QV&hl=e). Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Whiskey Riff Services, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out of tailored advertising.

**Device Location Information**

We may collect different types of information about your location, including general information (e.g., IP address, zip code) and more specific information (e.g., GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to access the Whiskey Riff  Services), and may use that information to customize the Whiskey Riff  Services with location-based information, advertising, and features. For example, if you provide a zip code that indicates that you live in Chicago, the Whiskey Riff Services may be customized with Chicago-specific information and advertisements. In order to do this, your location information may be passed along to our affiliates, agents, vendors or advertisers. If you access the Whiskey Riff Services through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provide us with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this. See your device manufacturer’s instructions for further details.

  * To attribute content that you make available through the Whiskey Riff  Services;

We may aggregate and/or anonymize information collected by the Whiskey Riff Services or via other means so that the information does not identify you. Our use and disclosure of aggregated, anonymized, and other non-personal information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may disclose it to others without limitation for any purpose.

  * We may disclose your information when we believe it appropriate in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving threats to the physical safety or property of any person, violations of the Terms of Use for the Whiskey Riff Services, and/or to protect our rights and property.



As we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.  Your information may also be transferred to a trustee or other person in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy or other insolvency event.

**How You Can Access and Update Your Information**
