White Flower Farm respects the privacy of every individual who visits our website. We collect a limited amount of information on usage so we can improve the content and design of our website, but this information is not identifiable by the individual user. We collect the Internet addresses of visitors, time of access, browser type, and web pages visited on an aggregate basis only. This information is used for internal review only and is not shared with third parties. The pages viewed by an individual visitor are not tracked. 

White Flower Farm may use cookies to allow us to better target messages to our visitors. If you would like to erase or block cookies, please refer to your browser instructions on how to do so.

**Your Security-**  
Orders placed through our website utilize SSL (secure socket layers) to protect credit card information so it cannot be read in transit.
