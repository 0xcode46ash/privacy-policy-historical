**Your Privacy-**  
White Flower Farm respects the privacy of every individual who visits our website. We collect a limited amount of information on usage so we can improve the content and design of our website, but this information is not identifiable by the individual user. We collect the Internet addresses of visitors, time of access, browser type, and web pages visited on an aggregate basis only. This information is used for internal review only and is not shared with third parties. The pages viewed by an individual visitor are not tracked. 

White Flower Farm may use cookies to allow us to better target messages to our visitors. If you would like to erase or block cookies, please refer to your browser instructions on how to do so. Please note that disabling cookies will prevent you from adding items to your shopping cart and you will not be able to order on-line. To order by phone, please call 1-800-503-9624 and our experienced customer service staff will assist you with your order. 

**Your Security-**  
Orders placed through our website utilize SSL (secure socket layers) to protect credit card information so it cannot be read in transit. Once our customer service representatives verify an order, it is deleted so there is no record of credit card information. If you do not have a browser that supports SSL or you are not comfortable sending your credit card information online then you can call (1-800-503-9624), fax (1-860-496-1418), or mail (White Flower Farm, PO Box 50, Litchfield CT 06759-9952) your order to us.
