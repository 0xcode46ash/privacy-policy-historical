We may share your personal information in the following ways:

  1. We contract with other companies to provide certain services, such as shipping, name and address verification, email distribution, market research and promotions management. We provide these companies with only that information needed in order for them to render the services we requested and they are not entitled to use it for their own marketing or any other purpose. 
  2. From time to time, we make our mailing list (names and addresses only) and general shopping activity available to reputable companies whose products we believe will be of interest to you. We do not share email addresses for this purpose. If you do not want us to share your information, please contact us. (See **Contact Us** below.)
  3. On rare occasion, we may disclose information upon law enforcement's request, in response to a court order, or when required by law. We may also share information to assist in fraud investigation and protection or as necessary to protect our rights and interests.

If you do not wish to be contacted via email, direct mail or telephone, please let us know your preferences by contacting customer service. (See **Contact Us** below.) So that we may identify you correctly, please provide your exact name and postal or email address. You may also unsubscribe from our email using the link provided in each email. If you ask us to remove you from promotional lists, we will maintain your name on a "do not contact" list to ensure that we continue to honor your requests. It may take up to 10 days to process your email request and, due to the fact that mailings are planned long in advance, 6 to 8 weeks to process your postal mail request. When you purchase online, we will continue to confirm your order and shipment status via email and, if questions arise concerning your order, we may contact you via email, postal address or telephone. If you change your mind about your choices, you may start receiving promotional communications from us again by logging on to your online account and changing your preferences, by signing up when you visit our websites or stores, when you enter a contest, sweepstakes or survey, or by contacting customer service.
