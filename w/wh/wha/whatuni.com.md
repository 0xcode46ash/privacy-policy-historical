## 4\. Disclosures

4.1 Your Personal Information may be passed to and used by our group companies in connection with providing services to you over our website and delivering or making our services available to you. Please note that some of our group companies may be located overseas in countries which do not have as extensive data protection laws as in the United Kingdom - for example, our software developers require certain test data (which may consist of Personal Information) and they are based in India.

4.2 We may also disclose your Personal Information in the following instances: (i) if we are required to do so by applicable law or under a court or similar order; (ii) as deemed necessary, in our discretion, to protect our legal rights or property or the legal rights or property of a Member or third party, or to prevent personal injury; and/or (iii) in connection with a sale, merger, assignment, joint venture or other transfer or disposition of a portion or all of our assets or stock or our affiliated entities (including, without limitation, in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).

## 5\. Hyperlinks to other web sites

5.1 This website contains hyperlinks to websites owned and operated by third parties which are beyond our control. For example, when you use our search engine for certain courses, the search results will provide links to other sites from our website's pages that take you outside our website. These other sites have their own privacy policies and we urge you to review them - because this Privacy Policy will not apply. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third party websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk.

5.2 We generally do not object to you linking directly to the homepage of our website, although we reserve the right to refuse our authorisation to such linking at our sole discretion. We do not permit our pages to be loaded into frames on your website - our web pages must load into the user's entire window.

5.3 We reserve the right to move or change our website URL at any time in order to meet changing business needs and to continually improve our online service. External websites link to our website at their own risk.

## 6\. Cookies

6.1 When you view or use our website we may store information on the hard drive of your computer in the form of a "cookie" (essentially a small text file). Cookies allow us to tailor our website to your interests and preferences. For example, a cookie might contain information about the web pages you have visited on our website, which could allow us to customise your next visit to our website. However, cookies do not allow us access to the rest of your computer and we do not use them to collect personally identifiable information about you.

6.2 Most internet browsers enable you to delete cookies or to receive a warning before a cookie is stored on your hard drive. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about how to do this. However, should you decide to disable any cookies we place on your computer you may not be able to use certain services or facilities on our website.

6.3 You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers or other third parties with links on our website. We do not control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.

## 7\. Search Engine

When you use our search engine, we may collect certain non-personally identifiable information through the use of cookies and other tracking technologies described above. For example, when you use our search engine, we may keep track of which search terms are popular. If we display advertising to you on our website (including the search results pages displayed after any searches you may run), such advertising may be related to the search terms you entered. We may present search result links in a format that enables us to understand whether they have been followed and we may monitor click-throughs. We use this information to understand and improve the quality of our search technology. For instance, this data helps us determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results.

## 8\. Community Areas and Course Reviews

Our website allows you to leave Course Reviews. They are open to the public and if you choose to disclose personally identifiable information or reveal your Profile to other users in these areas you are consenting to its unrestricted distribution in a public forum throughout our website and to and by other users of our website. We therefore cannot be responsible for the protection or security of such information, regardless of its sensitivity. You disclose all such information entirely at your own risk.

Please do not disclose personal information about third parties in these forums - it is prohibited, and we reserve the right to ban you from our website if you breach this rule.

## 9\. Updating Your Personal Information

To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, we wish to keep it up-to-date. Please let us know if your Personal Information changes by sending the details to Data Protection / Marketing, First Floor, Bedford House, Fulham Green, 69-79 Fulham High Street, London SW6 3JW [support.team@whatuni.com](mailto:support.team@whatuni.com). We will try to incorporate the changes as soon as practicable.

## 10\. Your right to see your Personal Information

You have the right to request a copy of the Personal Information that we hold on you and to have any errors in that information corrected. We may charge a reasonable fee for such requests as permitted by law. Please address your request to Data Protection / Marketing, First Floor, Bedford House, Fulham Green, 69-79 Fulham High Street, London SW6 3JW [support.team@whatuni.com](mailto:support.team@whatuni.com). We will use reasonable efforts to supply, correct or delete Personal Information about you on our files.
