An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer whenever you’re using the Internet. Web servers and other systems on the Internet automatically identify your computer by its IP address.

When visitors request pages from Whataburger.com, our servers log the visitor’s IP address. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a visitor’s session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us.
