Effective March 4, 2009

Your privacy is very important to us.

Our policy is to respect and protect the privacy of all visitors to Whataburger.com, AreYouOrangeEnough.com and other web sites (referred hereafter as Web Site) that are owned and operated by Whataburger Restaurants LP and its affiliates. In that regard, this Privacy Policy is available for view by clicking on the “Privacy Policy” link at the bottom of the main page of the Whataburger.com web site.

In this document, we explain how we use information you supply us. If we update our privacy policy, all revisions will be posted on this page. We reserve the right to change the privacy policy at any time without prior notice.

For your convenience we have organized our Privacy Policy into the following topics.

  * Information Collection and Use
  * Information Sharing and Disclosure
  * Uses of E-mail Addresses
  * Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors
  * Use of Cookies
  * Our Commitment to Security



Two types of information may be collected when you visit a Whataburger Web Site; 1) information which you knowingly provide us (called personally identifiable information), and 2) information which is obtained from your visit but is not directly associated with you (called non-personally identifiable information).

When you sign up to use one or more of our services, send an e-mail, ask a question, offer an opinion or order items in the online store, we may specifically ask for information about you, including, but not limited to your name, age, address, telephone number, e-mail address, birthdate, financial and/or demographic information and payment information. This information is used to fulfill the services you requested or to better our Web Site offerings to you and users like you.

In the normal course of using a Web Site we may collect information about your habits and usage of our sites. This non-personally identifiable information is collected without any direct association with you specifically.

INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE

Employees or Whataburger and its agencies, agents and contractors of Whataburger who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and the high standards of this organization.

Information about you specifically WILL NOT be used for any purpose other than to carry out the specific services you requested from Whataburger.

We WILL NOT SELL OR RENT your personally identifiable information to anyone at any time without your prior permission.

We will not use any personal or financial information beyond what is necessary to assist us in delivering to you the services you have requested.

We will send personally identifiable information about you to other organizations or individuals only when:

  1. We have your consent to share the information; 
  2. We need to share your information in order to provide the product or service you have requested; or 
  3. We are required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. 



We routinely use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our Web Sites and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information to analyze site usage, as well as to offer products, programs, or services to you or other users like you.

USES OF E-MAIL ADDRESSES

Whataburger and its affiliates may periodically send informational or promotional e-mail messages. Sometimes these are referred to as newsletters. You will not receive such e-mail messages unless, at the time you provided us with your e-mail address, you indicated that you wished to receive such promotional e-mails. If you are asked for your e-mail address and not given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving additional information, then the e-mail address is to be used only for the specific service you requested. If you subscribe to receive promotional e-mails from Whataburger and wish to stop receiving such e-mails, you may request discontinuation of e-mail messages by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link on the e-mail you received or by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the main page of the Whataburger.com web site.

COLLECTION OF INFORMATION BY THIRD-PARTY SITES AND SPONSORS

The Whataburger Web Sites may contain links to various other web sites that are not controlled by Whataburger. While we encourage other site developers to adopt privacy policies that build users’ trust and confidence, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of web sites linked to our Web Sites or to which we link. Visitors should consult the other web sites’ privacy policies, as we have no control over the information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

USE OF COOKIES

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer’s hard drive by our servers to identify you and/or your specific computer. Cookies should only be read by the server that originally placed them. In some cases your computer must accept cookies in order for us to complete the service or transaction you are requesting. We may use cookies to recognize you when you visit our Web Sites, to personalize your experience and generally to serve you better. For example, if you enter your name, address, telephone number, email address, ZIP code or other personally identifiable information on one of our forms, such information may be, but is not necessarily always, stored in a cookie so you do not have to enter this information again.

IP Addresses

An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer whenever you’re using the Internet. Web servers and other systems on the Internet automatically identify your computer by its IP address. Whataburger collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregated information to our sponsors, and to audit the use of our Web Sites. When visitors request pages from a Whataburger Web Site, our servers log the visitor’s IP address. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a visitor’s session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us. 

OUR COMMITTMENT TO SECURITY

WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO PUT IN PLACE APPROPRIATE PHYSICAL, ELECTRONIC, AND MANAGERIAL PROCEDURES TO SAFEGUARD AND HELP PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, MAINTAIN DATA SECURITY, AND CORRECTLY USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT VIA WHATABURGER WEB SITES AND THE INTERNET. WE DO NOT SELL, TRADE, OR RENT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITHOUT YOUR PRIOR KNOWLEDGE AND PERMISSION.
