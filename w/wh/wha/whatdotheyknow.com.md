# Your privacy - WhatDoTheyKnow

Who gets to see my email address? #
    

We will not disclose your email address to anyone unless we are obliged to by law, or you ask us to. This includes the public authority that you are sending a request to. They only get to see an email address @whatdotheyknow.com which is specific to that request. 

If you send a message to another user on the site, then it will reveal your email address to them. You will be told that this is going to happen.

Will you send nasty, brutish spam to my email address? #
    Nope. After you sign up to WhatDoTheyKnow we will only send you emails relating to a request you made, an email alert that you have signed up for, or for other reasons that you specifically authorise. We will never give or sell your email addresses to anyone else, unless we are obliged to by law, or you ask us to. 
Why will my name and my request appear publicly on the site? #
    

We publish your request on the Internet so that anybody can read it and make use of the information that you have found. We do not normally delete requests (more details). 

Your name is tangled up with your request, so has to be published as well. It is only fair, as we're going to publish the name of the civil servant who writes the response to your request. Using your real name also helps people get in touch with you to assist you with your research or to campaign with you. 

By law, you must use your real name for the request to be a valid Freedom of Information request. See the next question for alternatives if you do not want to publish your full name. 

Can I make an FOI request using a pseudonym? #
    

Technically, you must use your real name for your request to be a valid Freedom of Information request in law. See this [guidance from the Information Commissioner](http://www.ico.org.uk/upload/documents/library/freedom_of_information/detailed_specialist_guides/name_of_applicant_fop083_v1.pdf) (January 2009). 

However, the same guidance also says it is good practice for the public authority to still consider a request made using an obvious pseudonym. You should refer to this if a public authority refuses a request because you used a pseudonym.

Be careful though, even if the authority follows this good practice, the pseudonym will probably make it impossible for you to complain to the Information Commissioner later about the handling of your request. 

There are several good alternatives to using a pseudonym.

  * Use a different form of your name. The guidance says that "Mr Arthur Thomas Roberts" can make a valid request as "Arthur Roberts", "A. T. Roberts", or "Mr Roberts", but **not** as "Arthur" or "A.T.R.". 
  * Women may use their maiden name.
  * In most cases, you may use any name by which you are "widely known and/or is regularly used". 
  * Use the name of an organisation, the name of a company, the trading name of a company, or the trading name of a sole trader. 
  * Ask someone else to make the request on your behalf. 
  * You may, if you are really stuck, ask us to make the request on your behalf. Please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/help/contact) with a good reason why you cannot make the request yourself and cannot ask a friend to. We don't have the resources to do this for everyone. 



Please do not try to impersonate someone else.

They've asked for my postal address! #
    

If a public authority asks you for your full, physical address, reply to them saying that section 8.1.b of the FOI Act asks for an "address for correspondence", and that the email address you are using is sufficient. 

The Ministry of Justice has [guidance on this](http://www.justice.gov.uk/information-access-rights/foi-guidance-for-practitioners/procedural-guidance/foi-what-constitutes) – _"As well as hard copy written correspondence, requests that are transmitted electronically (for example, in emails) are acceptable ... If a request is received by email and no postal address is given, the email address should be treated as the return address."_

As if that isn't enough, the Information Commissioner's [Hints for Practitioners](http://www.ico.org.uk/upload/documents/library/freedom_of_information/practical_application/foi_hints_for_practitioners_handing_foi_and_eir_requests_2008_final.pdf) say _"Any correspondence could include a request for information. If it is written (this includes e-mail), legible, gives the name of the applicant, an address for reply (which could be electronic), and includes a description of the information required, then it will fall within the scope of the legislation."_

No no, they need a postal address to send a paper response! #
    

If an authority only has a paper copy of the information that you want, they may ask you for a postal address. To start with, try persuading them to scan in the documents for you. You can even [offer to gift them a scanner](http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/car_parking_charges_policy_and_a#outgoing-532), which in that particular case embarrassed the authority into finding one they had already.

If that doesn't work, and you want to provide your postal address privately in order to receive the documents, mark your request as "They are going to reply by post", and it will give you an email address to use for that purpose.

What about cookies and third party services? #
    

**Our use of cookies and external services: what you should know, and how to opt out if you want to.**

Summary: We care a lot about our users’ privacy. We provide details below, and we try our hardest to look after the private data that we hold. Like many other websites, we sometimes use cookies and Google Analytics to help us make our websites better. These tools are very common and used by many other sites, but they do have privacy implications, and as a charity concerned with socially positive uses of the internet, we think it’s important to explain them in full. If you don’t want to share your browsing activities on mySociety’s sites with other companies, you can adjust your usage or install opt-out browser plugins. 

**Cookies**

To make our service easier or more useful, we sometimes place small data files on your computer or mobile phone, known as cookies; many websites do this. We use this information to, for example, remember you have logged in so you don't need to do that on every page, or to measure how people use the website so we can improve it and make sure it works properly. Below, we list the cookies and services that this site can use. 

Name| Typical Content| Expires  
---|---|---  
_wdtk_cookie_session| A random unique identifier| When web browser is closed, or 1 month if 'Remember me' is used  
seen_foi2| The number 1 if you have seen a notice| 7 days  
last_request_id| A number, identifying the last FOI request you looked at on the site| When web browser is closed  
last_body_id| A number, identifying the last public authority you looked at on the site| When web browser is closed  
  
**Measuring website usage (Google Analytics)**

We use Google Analytics to collect information about how people use this site. We do this to make sure it’s meeting its users’ needs and to understand how we could do it better. Google Analytics stores information such as what pages you visit, how long you are on the site, how you got here, what you click on, and information about your web browser. IP addresses are masked (only a portion is stored) and personal information is only reported in aggregate. We do not allow Google to use or share our analytics data for any purpose besides providing us with analytics information, and we recommend that any user of Google Analytics does the same. 

If you’re unhappy with data about your visit to be used in this way, you can install the [official browser plugin for blocking Google Analytics](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). 

The cookies set by Google Analytics are as follows: 

Name| Typical Content| Expires  
---|---|---  
__utma| Unique anonymous visitor ID| 2 years  
__utmb| Unique anonymous session ID| 30 minutes  
__utmz| Information on how the site was reached (e.g. direct or via a link/search/advertisement)| 6 months  
__utmx| Which variation of a page you are seeing if we are testing different versions to see which is best| 2 years

Can you delete my requests, or alter my name? #
    

WhatDoTheyKnow is a permanent, public archive of Freedom of Information requests. Even though you may not find the response to a request useful any more, it may be of interest to others. For this reason, we will not delete requests. 

Under exceptional circumstances we may remove or change your name on the website, see the next question. Similarly, we may also remove other personal information. 

If you're worried about this before you make your request, see the section on pseudonyms.

Can you take down personal information about me? #
    

If you see any personal information about you on the site which you'd like us to remove or hide, then please [let us know](https://web.archive.org/help/contact). Specify exactly what information you believe to be problematic and why, and where it appears on the site.

If it is sensitive personal information that has been accidentally posted, then we will usually remove it. Normally we will only consider requests to remove personal information which come from the individual concerned, but for sensitive information we would appreciate anyone pointing out anything they see.

We consider that there is a strong public interest in retaining the names of officers or servants of public authorities. We will only remove such names in exceptional circumstances, such as where the disclosure of a name and position of employment would substantially risk an individual's safety. If you are such an official and you wish to have your name removed for such an urgent reason, you must supply us with a request to do so from your line manager. This request must demonstrate that a risk has been perceived which outweighs the public interest, and must demonstrate that efforts have been made to conceal the name on the organisation's own website.

For all other requests we apply a public interest test to decide whether information should be removed. [ Section 32](http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?ActiveTextDocId=3190650) of the Data Protection Act 1998 permits us to do this, as the material we publish is journalistic. We cannot easily edit many types of attachments (such as PDFs, or Microsoft Word or Excel files), so we will usually ask that authorities resend these with the personal information removed.
