# WhatCounts List Management

## Privacy

**Storage of Information**  
All information gathered by us for a particular client is accessible only by: 

  * Our account representatives for the purpose of consulting  
the client about their campaigns 

  * Our system administrators 

  * The client themselves 




**Security**  
If you have questions regarding the security practices employed by us please send them to [security@whatcounts.com](mailto:security@whatcounts.com). 

**Opt In/Out**  
Our systems and technology manage permission e-mailing lists for our clients. We don't rent, sell or broker e-mail lists. We don't support spamming and don't allow our customers to spam. We monitor the bounce and unsubscribe activity for all our customer's lists in order to detect patterns we believe are counter to a truly permission-oriented system. Our services are designed to be 100% permission-based and our customers all subscribe to that model. We support double opt-in/out features. However, it's up to our customers to decide whether to use them. 

**Sharing Information**  
WhatCounts does not sell, rent, loan, trade, or lease any personal information whether collected by our tracking technology or received by its clients. Nor do we allow one customer to access the data of another customer. When WhatCounts collects personally identifiable information for any of our clients, that information belongs to those respective clients and is subject to their polices on sharing of the end user information. 

**Note to Clients**  
WhatCounts will make the best effort to assist its clients in complying with privacy laws and adhering to the highest industry standards on privacy.
