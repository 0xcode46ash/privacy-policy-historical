# Privacy policy - Who Runs Gov - Government directory

Last Updated: January 22, 2009

This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for the Who Runs Gov website (the “Site” or “Who Runs Gov”), a service of The Washington Post Company.  In this Privacy Policy, the terms “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to The Washington Post Company, and the terms “you” and “your” refer to you as a user of the Site.

We respect the privacy of visitors to our Site.  In adopting this privacy policy, our intent is to balance our legitimate business interests in collecting and using personally identifiable information and your reasonable expectations of privacy.  This Privacy Policy governs our collection of information from you through your use of the Site.  It does not apply to any information you may provide to us through other means (for example, information gathered offline, such as information gathered via mail or telephone, or information gathered via another website operated by The Washington Post Company or any of its affiliates).

By using this Site, you agree that your use of the Site and any disputes over our online privacy practices are governed by this Privacy Policy and our [User Agreement](http://www.whorunsgov.com/User_agreement).  If you have questions about this policy, please contact us at [profiles@whorunsgov.com](mailto:profiles@whorunsgov.com).  

**What personally identifiable information does Who Runs Gov collect?**

We may collect and store information, personal or otherwise, that you voluntarily supply to us while on our Site or in communicating via email in connection with a feature provided on our Site.  Some examples of this type of information include information that you submit electronically when you contact us with questions or request email updates or RSS feeds, and information that you post on discussion boards or other community posting areas on our Site.  We also may ask you to provide certain personally identifiable information to register for the Site. 

You can elect to provide additional information to complete your user profile. 

The more information you provide, the more valuable your user profile will be to other users who wish to know more about you as a Site user and, if you contribute content or information to the Site, as an author of Site postings.  We may also ask you for other information at other times - such as when you enter a contest or participate in a promotion, when you post an online ad, when you participate in our message boards, or when you order products from us. 

The information you voluntarily supply to us will help us provide you with the services or features requested, process your registration request, offer you more personalized features, and tailor the Site to your interests.  Supplying such information is entirely voluntary.  However, if you choose not to supply the information requested, we may be unable to provide you with services made available to other users of our Site.

**How does Who Runs Gov use my personally identifiable information?**

We may use the personally identifiable information that you provide to us in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, for purposes of processing your registration request, offering you more personalized features, tailoring the Site to your interests, providing you with a service you have requested, sending you RSS feeds and email notifications you have requested, contacting you for customer service purposes, sending you email updates, administrative notices and other communications that we believe may be of interest to you, and contacting you for editorial purposes, such as to contact you as part of an online survey.  

We also may use the information provided by you to: 1) contact you with legal notices, 2) to advise you of any material changes or additions to our Site, our User Agreement or this Privacy Policy, and 3) notify you of your account status (including confirmation of Site registration).  

If you do not wish to receive the foregoing, you must unregister from the Site by emailing [profiles@whorunsgov.com](mailto:profiles@whorunsgov.com) and asking to have your registration account inactivated. Once your account has been inactivated, you will no longer have access to the Site.  To re-register, you will need to email us at [profiles@whorunsgov.com](mailto:profiles@whorunsgov.com) and ask to have your account re-activated. 

In order to provide services free of charge, we may display advertisements on the Site, and may deliver targeted advertisements on behalf of advertisers. If we deliver targeted advertisements via the Site, advertisers will give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, females over 25 years old). We will then take the advertisement and display it to users meeting that criteria. In this process, the advertiser never has access to individual account information.

We also may conduct research on our users' demographics, interests and behavior based on the information you provide to us via the Site, as well as from our server log files or from surveys.  We do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis that does not personally identify any user(s).  We may share this aggregated data with advertisers or other businesses.  

In addition, under confidentiality agreements, we may match user information with third party data to verify or enhance our own records.

You agree that we may use any information submitted by you for any purpose related to the Site, including the purposes detailed above in this section.  If you do not agree to such uses, please do not provide any personally identifiable information to us via the Site.

**Do other companies or people have access to personally identifiable information I provide to Who Runs Gov?**

When you submit personally identifiable information via the Site, you are providing that information to The Washington Post Company, its divisions or affiliates, or vendors providing contractual services for the Site (such as hosting vendors and list managers), and such information may be shared among The Washington Post Company and its divisions and affiliates.  If personally identifiable information is being provided to and/or maintained by any third party other than these, our policy is that we will not transfer that personally identifiable information unless notice is given prior to transfer.

**Promotions:** Promotions that are offered via the Site may be sponsored by companies other than The Washington Post Company or may be co-sponsored by The Washington Post Company and another company. Some or all personally identifiable information provided by you during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor or co-sponsor. If information will be shared, we will disclose such sharing prior to the transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don't want your personally identifiable information to be shared. In certain circumstances, you may not be able to participate in a particular promotion if you chose not to share personally identifiable information. Currently, most Who Runs Gov promotions are limited to U.S. or North American residents.

We do not control the privacy policies of our advertisers, sponsors or other sites or businesses to which we provide hyperlinks or access.  Please visit the sites of these businesses to review their privacy policies.

You should be aware that, when you voluntarily disclose personal information in discussion areas, community posting areas, or in your public user profile, that information may be collected by others and may result in unsolicited messages from others.

Please also be aware that we may occasionally release information about our Site visitors and users if required to do so by law or if, in our business judgment, such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce our [User Agreement](http://www.whorunsgov.com/User_agreement); or (c) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of our Site, our officers, directors, affiliates, staff, representatives, members or other users, and/or the public.  Also, in the unlikely event that The Washington Post Company or substantially all of The Washington Post Company’s assets are acquired by another organization or company, information about our Site visitors may be among the transferred assets.

Except as stated in this Privacy Policy or at the time of collection, a user's personally identifiable information will not be transferred to a party outside The Washington Post Company, its divisions or affiliates, or its service vendors unless notice is given at the time of collection or prior to transfer.

**What other information is collected via Who Runs Gov?**

The web servers on which the Site is hosted automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address.  We use this information to deliver the Site’s content to you upon request and to measure traffic within the Site.  Our Site’s servers also may log information such as the type of web browser software you use to access the Site, the operating system running on your computer, the speed of your computer’s CPU, the web pages you visited immediately before and after you visited the Site, and the pages you visit within the Site, for purposes of measuring traffic patterns on the Site and the usage of Site services and features and optimizing the Site to accommodate our users.  This information is not correlated with any personally identifying information you may provide.  We may provide this information (as well as information from third-party market researchers) on an aggregated, anonymous basis to our advertisers.

We also may use "cookies," a standard feature of browser software, to store and sometimes track certain information.  A cookie can be used to tell when your computer has contacted a website, and we also may use cookies to measure traffic patterns on our Site.  We can make the Site more effective if we know which areas our users are visiting and how often.  Cookies also can help us ensure that you don't see the same ad too many times in a single session and that you do not have to reenter your login name or password during your visit.  We also may use cookies to track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions and contests.  You may opt-out of the cookies delivered by the Site by changing the setting on your browser.  Please be aware, however, that this will disable all cookies delivered to your browser, not just the ones delivered by our Site, and that by disabling cookies you may be unable to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users of our Site.  

Our Site also may employ web beacons to access cookies and to count users who visit our Site or open our HTML-formatted email messages.  Web beacons are small strings of HTML code that are placed in a Web page. They are sometimes called “clear GIFs” (Graphics Interchange Format) or “pixel tags.”  Web beacons are most often used in conjunction with cookies.  Because a Web beacon is only 1 pixel high by 1 pixel wide, it appears invisible on your computer screen.

Third party advertisers or third party ad servers that place and present advertising on our Site also may collect information from you via cookies, web beacons or similar technologies, a process that we do not control.  These third party advertisers and ad servers may use the information they collect to help present their advertisements, to help measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness, or for other uses.  The use and collection of your information by these third party advertisers and ad servers is governed by the relevant third party's privacy policy and is not covered by our privacy policy.

**Can I opt out of the cookies and web beacons used by third-party advertisers and ad servers?  **

Online advertising for Who Runs Gov is delivered by the vendor DoubleClick. This vendor, like other advertising service vendors, places cookies on users' hard drives so that its systems can identify your computer, and uses cookies and web beacons to deliver targeted advertising to the websites it services.  By using such cookies and web beacons, DoubleClick is able, among other things, to determine automatically whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. It also is able to serve you advertisements tailored to things you have shown interest in based on other sites you have visited. DoubleClick allows you the option of opting out of its use of advertising cookies. If you do not want the benefits of DoubleClick’s advertising cookies, there is a simple procedure that allows you to deny or accept this feature. For more information about DoubleClick's use of cookies and web beacons, and to "opt out" of receiving DoubleClick cookies, visit <http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx>.

Please note that opting out through the above procedure will affect not only the Who Runs Gov website, but other sites served by DoubleClick as well.  However, it will not affect the cookies used by Who Runs Gov.

Often our advertisers contract with third-party ad service vendors to host their ads.  Independent cookies and/or web beacons may be used by those third-party services when they deliver ads to our Site.  We do not have a mechanism to allow visitors to opt-out of cookies from vendors with whom we do not have a contractual relationship.

**What is this Site’s policy on children’s privacy?**

This Site is not directed to children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.  If you are under the age of 13, do not send any information about yourself to us - including information like your name, address or email address. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally-identifiable information from a user under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records.  Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, we also do not knowingly distribute any such information to third parties.  We do not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information.

 

**How can I modify my registration information?**

If you register on the Site, you will have the opportunity to review, update, and/or change any of the information you have provided to us (and that we continue to store) at any time, except that your username may not be changed once it has been submitted.  To review, update and/or change your registration information, log in to the Site and click on the “My Account” drop down menu and select the appropriate option for the information you would like to review, update or change (for example, if you would like to change your password or email address, select “My Preferences;” if you would like to change your profile information, select “My profile page.”).

**How is my personally identifiable information stored?**

We have in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect online.  However, as effective as these measures are, no security system is impenetrable.  We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the internet.

**How will I be notified of changes to this Privacy Policy?**

Technology on the Internet is developing at a rapid pace, and we need to maintain our flexibility in the online arena.  If we need to change this Privacy Policy in the future, we will post the modified Privacy Policy on the Site and update the “Last Updated” date of the policy to reflect the date of the changes.  By continuing to use the Site after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.
