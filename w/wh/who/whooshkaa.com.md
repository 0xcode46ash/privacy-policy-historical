### Privacy Policy

#### 1\. Introduction

To provide you with the Whooshkaa service (the “Service”), we, Whooshkaa Pty Ltd, [www.Whooshkaa.com](http://www.whooshkaa.com/), (“Whooshkaa”, “we”, “us”, “our”), need to collect some information about you.

#### 4\. How we share the information we collect

We may share the information we collect, including your personal information, as follows:

1\. We are building an interactive audio on demand Service that offers many ways to find, enjoy, and share content with others. We encourage our users to use the social functions of the Service, for example to explore who else is using the Service, and therefore parts of your Whooshkaa information may be publicly available to others by default, such as your name, profile picture, your friends on the Service and your activity.

2\. Whooshkaa enables you to share a particular item of content, for example part of a podcast, to third party services or other Whooshkaa users by using the Service’s share functionality. Please note that sharing of such content on a third party service (for example Facebook or Twitter) may be posted as activity on the Service and on said third party service. To share an individual item of content to a third party service, you’ll be prompted to enter your access credentials for that third party service. Whooshkaa may store your username and access token or similar credentials obtained from the third party service, so that you are able to share particular items of content, on that third party service, on an individual basis, without entering your access credentials again. You understand and agree that Facebook’s, Twitter’s or other third parties’ use of information they collect from you is governed by their privacy policies, and Whooshkaa’s use of such information is governed by this Privacy Policy.

  1. We may from time to time share your information within the Whooshkaa group as well as certain trusted business partners and third party service providers to enable them to perform functions and process user data on our behalf. Such processing of user data will always be subject to security and confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.

  2. Finally, we may also share your information to third parties for the following purposes:



  * to allow a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets;
  * to respond to legal process, if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to do so; 
  * to comply with requirements of mandatory applicable law; 
  * to protect the safety of any person;
  * to protect the rights and property of Whooshkaa, any user or a third party; and to address fraud, security or technical issues;



#### 5\. Transfer of information we collect to other countries

Whooshkaa processes information about our users on servers located in a number of countries and Whooshkaa may subcontract processing to, or share your information with, third parties located in countries, other than your home country, for example outside the Australian Area (“AA”), where you may have fewer legal rights in relation to your information. However, we take the security of personal information very seriously and we will not take any decisions lightly to transfer any information to countries outside of the AA.

#### 6\. Accessing and updating user information

You can access and amend some of the information we keep on you through your settings. To learn more about the information we store about you, e-mail [info@Whooshkaa.com](mailto:info@Whooshkaa.com). We will respond within a reasonable period of time upon verification of your identity.
