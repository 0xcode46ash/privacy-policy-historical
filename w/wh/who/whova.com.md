# Privacy Policy | Whova

Whova Inc provides Services through whova.com web pages and Whova apps to you subject to this Privacy Policy, its Terms of Use, and its other policies. Whova may change this Privacy Policy at any time. By continuing to access or use whova Services, you accept any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy.

### IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS POLICY, DO NOT USE WHOVA

**1\. Information Available in Whova Services** Whova aggregates publicly available information from company web pages, university web pages, news pages, public social network profiles, publication databases, patent databases, and other public sources (“Public Information”). This Public Information is available to public directly from those sources (even without Whova). Whova does not verify and cannot guarantee the accuracy of this Public Information. For certain social network websites, Whova will only get and show information if users provided corresponding login credentials. It is a user’s responsibility to validate and revise his own profile information in Whova Apps (including Whova Android App, Whova IOS App and Whova Web App).

**2\. Opt in/out Policy for the Attendee List on the Whova Apps**  
Whova supports three different policies on whether an attendee is listed in the event attendee list on Whova Apps. Event organizers can decide which policy to apply to their events in Whova Apps and it is the event organizers’ responsibility to make their attendees (users) be aware of the policy.

Please note that regardless of opt in/out policy, attendees’ contact information (e.g. emails, phone numbers) is not disclosed to other attendees unless users explicitly exchange their contact information via Whova Apps.

  * a) Policy 1: Opt-out. Under this policy, attendees (minus some VIPs selected by organizers) are listed in the attendee list on Whova Apps to help foster pre-event networking. If a user does not want his/her name and profile to be listed and viewed by other attendees, he/she needs to explicitly opt themselves out by changing the visibility setting on the Setting menu to be “invisible”.
  * b) Policy 2: Opt-in once sign-in. Under this policy, once an attendee signs in to Whova Apps, his/her name will be listed in the attendee list of this event to facilitate networking. They can still become invisible by changing the visibility setting on the Setting menu. If an attendee never signs in to Whova Apps, his/her name is not listed.
  * c) Policy 3: Explicit Opt-in. Under this policy, once an attendee signs in to Whova Apps, he/she is explicitly asked whether he/she wants to be listed in the attendee list for other attendees to network with him/her. Based on the answer, his/her initial visibility status will be set to “visible” or “invisible”, and he/she can still switch between the two by changing it on the Setting menu. If an attendee never signs in to Whova Apps, his/her name is not listed.



**3\. Remove Your Information from Whova Services** You have a choice to remove your information from Whova services by contacting us at support@whova.com. After verification (we will need you to verify that you are removing your own information instead of others), we remove your information from Whova Service. Note that since Whova collects information from Internet, having information removed from Whova Service does not mean that it is removed from its original data sources. In the Whova app, user can also validate and revise his own profile.

  * b) Whova does not knowingly aggregate or provide Public Information about people under the age of 18. Whova’s email search may return Public Information about children between the ages of 13 and 18 because this Public Information originates from third-party social networking sites and websites that permit children who are 13 years and older to create public profiles.



**7\. Security** We have tried our best in removing any possible security holes in our released browser extensions and apps, but since it is hard to 100% verify software, we cannot provide 100% guarantee that Whova Services has zero security vulnerability. Whova is not responsible for any security issues caused by Whova Services.
