The following discloses the privacy policy (“Privacy Statement”) related to information collected
through the web properties of Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively
“Beasley, or “we”, “us”, “our”), including, web pages, interactive features, iRadioNow,
applications, widgets, blogs and their respective contents, in addition to Twitter, Facebook or
other social networking sites, and their respective contents, whether accessed via computer,
mobile device or other technology platforms (collectively, the “Platforms”).
INFORMATION WE COLLECT.
The Platforms may ask you to provide information that could reasonably be used to contact you
or to identify you personally (such as your name, email address, telephone number, home
address, gender, birth date, your interests or other profile-related information (“Personal
Information”). For example, Beasley may collect Personal Information when you register on the
Platforms, request information, submit comments or participate in a promotion, survey or other
feature of the Platforms, or otherwise communicate or interact with us. If you do not want your
Personal Information collected, please do not submit it.
Whenever you visit or interact with the Platforms, Beasley, as well as any third-party advertisers
and/or service providers, may automatically collect non-Personal Information, such as, browser
type, device type, operating system, the preceding page views, and your use of features or
applications on the Platforms, such as song history, interaction with friends and group activities.
This information helps us to improve the design and content of our Platforms.
Beasley also automatically collects your IP address or other unique identifier for the computer,
mobile device, technology or other device you use to access the Platforms. This identifier is a
number that is automatically assigned to your device when you access a website or its servers,
and our computers identify your device by it. We may use this information to administer the
Platforms, help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends, track users’ web page
movements, help identify you and your shopping preferences, and gather broad demographic
information for aggregate use.
HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION
Beasley uses the information collected about and from you for a variety of business purposes,
including internal business purposes and to: respond to your questions and requests; provide you
with access to certain areas and features of the Platforms such as your favorite stations, your
musical preferences, songs you have listened to, shared playlists and your interaction with other
users; verify your identity; communicate with you; tailor content, provide advertisements and
offers; process applications and transactions; and for purposes disclosed at the time you provide
your Personal Information or otherwise with your consent. To the extent that you provide us with
financial related information in connection with shopping or commercial services offered
through the Platforms, we will use the financial information that you provide to bill you for
products and services. By submitting your credit card and related personal information to the
Platforms, you authorize us to give that information to the merchant and credit card company in


order to confirm and fulfill your order. We will use contact information from the order form to
fulfill your orders. We will not otherwise use or distribute your financial information without
your prior approval.
Cookies and Pixel tags.
To enhance your experience with our Platforms, many of our Platforms use cookies or pixel tags.
Cookies are data files placed on a device when it is used to visit the Platforms. Cookies by
themselves, do not tell us your email address or other personally identifiable information unless
you choose to provide this information to us, by, for example, registering at one of our Platforms.
Once you choose to furnish the Platform with personally identifiable information, however, this
information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. Beasley, or our third-party service
providers, may place cookies or similar files on your device for security purposes, to facilitate
site navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting our Platforms. Cookies allow us
to collect technical and navigational information, such as browser type, time spent on our
Platforms and pages visited. Cookies allow us to understand Platform usage and to improve the
content and offerings on our Platforms. If you would prefer not to accept cookies, you can
change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose
whether or not to accept it; or set your browser to automatically not accept any cookies.
However, please be aware that some features and services on our Platforms may not work
properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your Beasley
account(s).
A pixel tag is a transparent graphic image, sometimes called a web beacon or tracking beacon,
placed on a web page to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing that
page. In addition, a pixel tag may tell your browser to get content from another server. The pixel
tags on Beasley’s Platforms are set only by companies with whom we work.
SHARING OF INFORMATION
Except as provided in this Privacy Statement, we will not provide any of your Personal
Information to any third parties without your specific consent. We may share non-Personal

provide your information.
We work closely with our business partners and certain other third parties who may perform
functions on our behalf in order to carry out your requests, to make various features, services and
materials available to you through the Platforms and to respond to your inquiries.
Consequently, we may share your Personal Information with third parties that perform functions
on our behalf (or on behalf of our partners), such as companies or individuals that process credit
card payments, host or operate our Platforms, analyze data or provide customer service;
administer our promotions or provide marketing or promotional assistance (such as in connection
with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law, such as on a winners list). Your
Personal Information may also be used by us or shared with our subsidiaries, affiliates, sponsors,
partners, advertisers or other third parties to provide you with product information and
promotional and other offers. Information collected by Beasley in connection with entering,


voting or otherwise participating in any contest may be shared with sponsors of such contests.
By entering, voting or otherwise participating in such contests, you are consenting to us sharing
this information with such contest sponsors who may contact you directly.
We license and/or utilize technology to serve advertisements on our own Platforms and within
content as that content is served across the Internet. In addition, we may also use third party ad
network providers to help present advertisements on the Platforms, as well as third party
analytics vendors to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of our Platforms and
viewing of our content.
COLLECTION OF INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM/BY THIRD PARTIES
You may choose to participate in a third party application or feature (such as Facebook or
Twitter applications or a similar application or feature on a third party website) through which
you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including Personal
Information such as lists of your friends, “likes”, comments you have shared, groups and
location. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party
website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections” or information
about you is otherwise accessible through your profile page or similar page on a social
networking or other third party website or interactive service.
The Platforms may make available to you chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups
and may contain links to other sites that we do not own or operate whose information practices
may be different from ours. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and/or partners that
may use our logo(s) as part of a co-branding or co-marketing agreement. We do not control,
recommend or endorse and are not responsible for these sites or their content, products, services
or privacy policies or practices. These other sites may send their own cookies to your device,
they may independently collect data or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have
their own published privacy policies. You should also independently assess the authenticity of
any site which appears or claims that it is one of our Platforms (including those linked to through
an email or social networking page). Please remember that any information that you disclose in
these areas becomes public information and is not subject to the provisions of this Privacy
Statement. Visitors should consult the other sites’ privacy policies as Beasley has no control
over information that is submitted to, or collected by these third parties.
CHANGING PERSONAL INFORMATION.
If you wish to modify, verify, correct, or delete any of your Personal Information collected
through the Platforms, you may edit your registered user information. It is not always possible to
completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases without some residual
data. Please be aware that we do not control certain privacy settings and preferences maintained
by social media partners like Facebook and Twitter. If you wish to make changes to those
settings and preferences, you may do so by visiting the settings page of the appropriate social
media site.

identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age. If we determine upon collection that
a user is under this age, we will not use or maintain his/her Personal Information without the
parent/guardian’s consent. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personally
identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, we will make reasonable efforts to
delete such information from our records.
