# Your privacy on NHS Choices

We collect information indirectly and directly.

When you access [www.nhs.uk](http://www.nhs.uk/), we use technology to collect information indirectly, such as your internet address, which is then kept in our internet access logs.

We collect information directly from you in a number of ways. One way is by using cookies. Cookies are small files of information that save and retrieve information about your visit to our site, such as how you entered our site, how you navigated through the site and what information was of interest to you. In addition to this, if you customise the homepage, we will store the information you give us in a cookie.

The cookies we use identify you merely as a number. (If you are uncomfortable about the use of cookies, you can disable cookies on your computer by changing the settings in the preferences or options menu in your internet browser.) 

We also collect information when you give it to us. For example, you may register to use the message-posting facility called 'Patient feedback'. When we collect this type of information, we will notify you as to why we are asking for information and how this information will be used. It is completely up to you whether you provide it.

When visiting NHS Choices pages that display a Facebook Like button, information relating to the date and time of your visit, the web page you are on (commonly known as the URL) and other technical information about the IP address, browser and operating system you use will be collected by Facebook. If you are logged into Facebook, your user ID number will also be associated with the information mentioned above. For more information, read the [Facebook privacy policy](http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=17512).
