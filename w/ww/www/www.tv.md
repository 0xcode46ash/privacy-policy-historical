You should be assured that we do not provide or sell personal information about our customers or Site visitors.

**Information We Gather from You**

**Personal Information**  
There are two ways in which you may explicitly and intentionally provide us with and consent to our collection of certain personal information:

E-mail Request for Information or Registrations for Guides or Seminars - We use links throughout our Site that may provide you with the opportunity to contact us via e-mail to ask questions, request information and materials, register or sign up for guides or seminars, or provide comments and suggestions. You may also be offered the opportunity to have one of our representatives contact you personally to provide additional information about our products or services. To do so, we may request additional personal information from you, such as your name and telephone number, to help us satisfy your request.

Contest - If you choose to enter a contest that we may be conducting from time to time, we will request certain information from you. Depending on the type of contest, you may be asked to provide different personal information. For example, we may require your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and/or names of individuals participating in the contest or any contest entry. For a detailed listing of the type of personal information requested, please refer to the registration request and terms and conditions associated with the particular contest. Under no circumstances do we collect any personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health, or sex life. Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything to the contrary, if you enter a contest that VeriSign may sponsor for time to time, your contest entry may contain personal information about yourself or others.

**Statistical Information About Your Visit  
** When you visit our Site, our computers may automatically collect statistics about your visit. This information does not identify you personally, but rather identifies information about a visit to our Site. We may monitor statistics such as how many people visit our Site, the user's IP address, which pages people visit, from which domains our visitors come and which browsers people use. We use these statistics about your visit for aggregation purposes only. These statistics are used to help us improve the performance of our Site.

**Use of Cookies**  
We only use "cookies" as described in this Section. A "cookie" is a piece of information that our Site sends to your browser, which then stores this information on your system. If a cookie is used, our Site will be able to "remember" information about you and your preferences either until you exit your current browser window (if the cookie is temporary) or until you disable or delete the cookie. Many users prefer to use cookies in order to help them navigate a site as seamlessly as possible. You should be aware that cookies contain no more information than you volunteer, and they are not able to "invade" your hard drive and return to the sender personal or other information from your computer.

Our uses of "cookies" are limited to the following specific situations. The first situation is with respect to temporary cookies. There are two instances in which we use temporary cookies. First, if you are accessing our services through one of our online applications our Web server may automatically send your browser a temporary cookie, which is used to help your browser navigate our Site. The only information contained in these temporary cookies is a direction value that lets our software determine which page to show when you hit the back button in your browser. This bit of information is erased when you close your current browser window. If you come to our Site from one of our business partners, our Web server may also send your browser a temporary cookie that reflects an "origination code" for that business partner. We use this information for statistical and marketing purposes. The second situation in which we may use cookies is with respect to permanent cookies. This type of cookie remains on your system, although you can always delete or disable it through your browser preferences. There are two instances in which we use a permanent cookie. First, when you visit our Site and request documentation or a response from us. When you are filling out a form you may be given the option of having our Site deliver a cookie to your local hard drive. You might choose to receive this type of cookie in order to save time in filling out forms and/or revisiting our Site. We only send this type of cookie to your browser when you have clicked on the box labeled "Please remember my profile information" when submitting information or communicating with us. The second instance where we use a permanent cookie is where we track traffic patterns on our Site. Analysis of the collected information by our tracking technologies allows us to improve our Site and the user experience. In both instances of a persistent cookie, if you choose not to accept the cookie, you will still be able to use our Site. Even if you choose to receive this type of cookie, you can always set your browser to notify you when you receive any cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it in each situation in which one is sent. 

**Bulletin Boards, Chat Rooms, Forums, and Contest Entries**  
If you use a forum, bulletin board, chat room, other chat tool that may be available on this Site from time to time, or you enter into a contest that VeriSign may sponsor from time to time, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there (including through a contest entry, such as via a video or other creative) can be read, collected, or used by other users/viewers of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. VeriSign is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in this manner. You are also responsible for using these forums in a manner consistent with any Rules of Engagement, official contest rules, or other terms and conditions as may be set forth on the relevant forum site.

**How We Use and With Whom We Share the Personal Information We Gather**  
We assure you that the personal information we gather from you is used by us only as explained below.

**Sending you responses and updates**  
We generally respond to any e-mail questions, requests for product or service information, and other inquiries that we receive. We may also retain this correspondence to improve our products, services, and Site, and for other disclosed purposes. Frequently we retain contact information so that we can send individuals updates or other important information about our services and products. In situations where you have supplied your information in connection with a question or request for information about a product or service offered by a VeriSign business partner, we may also send the information you have supplied to the VeriSign business partners that offer such products or services. 

**Notifications Regarding a Contest**  
If you choose to enter into a contest that we may be conducting from time to time, VeriSign may use the information collected from you for purposes of the contest entry, which may include notifying an entrant that a submission is received and notifying contest winners. 

**Disclosure by Law and Protection of VeriSign and Others**  
If we are required by law to disclose certain information to local, state, federal, national or international government or law enforcement authorities, we will do so. We will also disclose information to third parties as necessary in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, VeriSign may share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud, or enforce or apply VeriSign's agreements.

**Business Transitions**  
Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, VeriSign decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses or business units in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is VeriSign’s practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions. 

**Surveys**  
From time-to-time we may request information from Site visitors via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use of and satisfaction with this Site, and improving our customer service and product offerings.

**Our Security Procedures**  
We consider the protection of all personal information we receive from our Site visitors and subscribers as critical to our corporate mission. Please be assured that we have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of any personal information we receive from you. As with any transmission over the Internet, however, there is always some element of risk involved in sending personal information. 

**Changes to this Privacy Statement**  
If a material change is made to this Privacy Statement and/or the way we use our customers' personally identifiable information then, we will post prominent notice of the nature of such change on the first page of this Privacy Statement and also on our home page.
