## Collection of Personal Information

It is intended that Victoria Online can be used anonymously. 

However, for some functions of Victoria Online the collection of personal information is necessary or unavoidable. 

You will know if Victoria Online is collecting personal information from you because you will be requested to provide it. There are two exceptions to this. 

The first exception is where someone else provides Victoria Online with your personal information. Victoria Online cannot prevent this. However, you are entitled to access and correct any personal information about you collected by Victoria Online. 

The second exception is where Victoria Online collects statistics using software techniques such as web server log file analysis, clickstream data, cookies and web beacons. For an explanation of these techniques, and how they are used on Victoria Online, see Web measurement services used by Victoria Online below. Such statistics may qualify as personal information under the _Information Privacy Act 2000 (Vic)_. However, these statistics are not used to identify individual users of Victoria Online.

## Internet Use Risk

You should be aware that there are risks in transmitting information across the Internet. However, Victoria Online takes reasonable steps to protect any personal information from unauthorised access once that personal information comes into its possession. 

## Linking

This website contains hyperlinks to pages contained on external government and non-government websites (third party websites). Unless otherwise indicated, Victoria Online: 

  * does not endorse or authorise the content of any third party website; 
  * is not affiliated or associated with the owner or operator of any third party website; and 
  * assumes no responsibility or liability for the condition or content of any third party website or for the operation or function of any service or facility offered on any third party website. 



## Website personalisation features of Victoria Online

### Use of Cookies

A cookie is a block of data that is shared between a web server and a user's browser. 

Victoria Online uses first party cookies to enable users to personalise their use of the website's weather information. A first party cookie is that which is created by the website you are currently visiting - in this case Victoria Online. If you do not allow cookies to be used within your browser, then you will not be able to take advantage of the weather personalisation features offered by this website. 

In using these cookies Victoria Online does not retrieve or record any personal information. For example, we do not use cookies to collect names or email addresses.

### Web Server Log Files

Victoria Online uses standard web analytics software packages to analyse its web server log files to track web site usage. This analysis provides general data including number of visits, unique visits, pages viewed, browser type, how the site is navigated, search terms used, the sections of the website visited and other website usage information without identifying individual users. 

## Web measurement services used by Victoria Online

Victoria Online currently uses two web measurement service providers. They are Google Analytics and Omniture SiteCatalyst. Google Analytics is also used by the [Info Vic Newsletter](http://www.vic.gov.au/newsletters/InfoVicNewsletters.html).

### Google Analytics - Use of Cookies

[Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) uses a first-party cookie and JavaScript code to collect information about visitors to Victoria Online. Google Analytics anonymously tracks how our visitors interact with this website, including where they came from, what they did on the site, and whether they completed any transactions on the site such as newsletter registration.

### Omniture SiteCatalyst - Use of Cookies

[Omniture SiteCatalyst](http://www.omniture.com/en/) uses first party cookies both to differentiate requests from different web browsers and to store helpful information that can be used by the application at a later time. In particular SiteCatalyst uses cookies to anonymously define new visitors, help analyze clickstream data within the website, and track historical activity on the web site for responses to particular campaigns such as the site's RSS news feed usage.

SiteCatalyst cookies contain no personally identifiable information. All cookie data is completely anonymous and is used to distinguish one web browser from another.

The SiteCatalyst cookies belong to the Victoria Online web site.

## Data Collection

While the anonymous statistical data Victoria Online collects may be aggregated and used in broader statistical analysis by the State of Victoria, at no time can we personally identify you as the source of that data.

## Contacts & Services Directory

The Contacts & Services Directory aims to assist citizens to find relevant services, websites or contacts within the Victorian Government.

To ensure privacy is being managed effectively and to report any possible breaches there are several feedback loops in place. On the Contacts & Services directory website there is a link to a feedback form for the general public to alert Victoria Online to errors or omissions in data for resolution or referral. The Information Victoria Call Centre phone number is displayed to allow for verbal feedback.
