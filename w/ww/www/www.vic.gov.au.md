# Victoria Online: Privacy

Victoria Online is the entry point website of the government of the State of Victoria, Australia (here referred to as “the Victorian Government”), operated by the Chief Technology Office, Multimedia Victoria, in the Department of Infrastructure. 

This privacy statement applies only to Victoria Online.

More specific privacy statements may apply to certain pages of Victoria Online (for example, the feedback page). 

Victoria Online links to a large number of other websites. This privacy statement does not apply to those websites. 

In this privacy statement the term “personal information” has the meaning provided in section 3 of the _[Information Privacy Act 2000](https://web.archive.org/CountHits?uri=pri02&redirectTo=http://www.dms.dpc.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/PubLawToday.nsf/2184e627479f8392ca256da50082bf3e/3b9de74d4c0869baca256e8400223467/$FILE/00-98a010.pdf)_[ (Vic.)

This Act is the legislation that regulates our collection and handling of personal information. 

Information about the Act is available at the [Office of the Victorian Privacy Commissioner](https://web.archive.org/CountHits?uri=pri03&redirectTo=http://www.privacy.vic.gov.au).

It is intended that Victoria Online can be used anonymously. 

However, for some functions of Victoria Online the collection of personal information is necessary or unavoidable. 

You will know if Victoria Online is collecting personal information from you because you will be requested to provide it. There are two exceptions to this. 

The first exception is where someone else provides Victoria Online with your personal information. Victoria Online cannot prevent this. However, you are entitled to access and correct any personal information about you collected by Victoria Online. 

The second exception is where Victoria Online collects statistics using software techniques such as clickstream data, cookies and web beacons. For an explanation of these techniques, and how they are used on Victoria Online, see Statistical Collection Methods below. Such statistics may qualify as personal information under the _Information Privacy Act_ 2000 (Vic.). However, these statistics are not used to identify individual users of Victoria Online. 

If Victoria Online requests you to provide personal information, you will be informed of the particular purposes for which that information is collected and will be used and/or disclosed. 

Personal information that is collected by Victoria Online will be used by and disclosed to Victorian Government employees or contractors whose duties require them to use it. Such employees and contractors are required to protect and handle your personal information in accordance with the _Information Privacy Act 2000_ (Vic.). 

You may request access to any personal information that Victoria Online may have collected about you. Also, you may request correction of your personal information if you can establish that it is not accurate, complete or up to date. 

The privacy officer for the Department of Infrastructure may be contacted about access to, and correction of, personal information collected by Victoria Online or for any questions or concerns you may have arising out of this privacy statement:

Clickstream data refers to visitor logs and statistics that provide useful information about users’ online experience without identifying individuals. Typical clickstream data collected includes: 

  * visitor’s computer address (ie Internet Protocol, or IP, address) and relevant domains; 
  * times and dates of site visits; 
  * pages accessed (including most visited and least visited) and files downloaded; 
  * browsers and operating systems used by visitors. 



Victoria Online uses clickstream data purely for statistical purposes (such as the most popular searches and the times of the day that Victoria Online is used most/least) without identifying individual users. 

A cookie is a block of data that is shared between a web server and a user's browser. 

Cookies may give the server information about a computer’s identity and website visiting patterns and preferences. Victoria Online does not use cookies to identify individual users.

A web beacon is a technology that records web page usage statistics. Victoria Online uses web beacons to collect clickstream data, but does not use beacons to identify individual users.
