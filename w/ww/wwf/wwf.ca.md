# WWF Canada - Privacy

**Personal Information**

Personal information is any information that can be used to distinguish, identify or contact a specific individual. This information can include an individual's name, contact information, social status and family relationships.

Exceptions include business-related information and certain publicly available information such as business address, name, title and fax. Where an individual uses his or her home contact information as business contact information as well, we consider that the contact information provided is business contact information. Personal information also does not include anonymous or non-personal information (i.e. information that cannot be associated with or tracked back to a specific individual).

**What Personal Information Do We Collect?**

We collect and maintain different types of personal information about individuals with whom we interact which is relevant for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate for a supporter-charity relationship. 

This includes: 

  * Contact and identification information, such as your name, address, telephone number, mobile number and e-mail address;
  * Donation information such as date of gift, amount of gift, appeal (the campaign you contributed to), name of spouse or partner if it was a joint gift; receipt number.
  * Financial information such as your payment methods and preferences, billing and banking information (credit card number and expiry date or chequing account transit numbers, whichever payment type you prefer in order to process your donation);
  * Product and service related information concerning the sale of apparel, books and gifts and other products or services that we provide to you;
  * Other personal information used for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in light of the circumstances.



**Why Do We Collect Personal Information?**

WWF-Canada collects personal information to further its fundraising, public education and advocacy commitments, as well as to establish, maintain and manage our relationship with you. Certain information is collected to satisfy the requirements of Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). 

**How Do We Use Your Personal Information?**

We will not, without your consent, use your personal information for any purpose other than as described in this privacy policy, except where permitted or required by applicable law or regulatory requirements. We use your personal information for administrative purposes, to process donations, and to respond to requests for information; to periodically keep you informed and up to date on WWF-Canadaâ€™s conservation activities, and provide you opportunities to support our mission; to communicate to you special announcements or offers and opportunities to lend you voice or take action; and to invite you to participate in surveys or contests. 

**Sharing of Personal Information**

Third party service providers may be engaged by WWF-Canada to perform a variety of functions, such as to mail our brochures, to process your donation, to fulfill your order or to provide technical services for our website, etc. These third party providers have access to personal information if needed to perform the functions for which they are retained. However, we direct that those companies may only use such personal information for the purpose of performing their roles and may not use it for any other purpose. In these cases, when information is shared, WWF-Canada will demand reasonable assurance that the third parties will protect your information in conformity with our privacy practices. 

On occasion, WWF-Canada may exchange the names of some of our donors with other like-minded charities. Trading allows us to reach other Canadians who may be interested in supporting the work we do, to raise necessary funds, and to save substantially on fundraising costs. WWF-Canada trades names only after donors have had the opportunity to decline. In keeping with best practices, our donors are provided the opportunity, on an annual basis, to update their preferences to their personal record. For more information, please contact a WWF-Canada Donor Relations team member at **1-800-26-PANDA** , or write to us at WWF-Canada, Donor Relations, 410-245 Eglinton Avenue East, Toronto, ON, M4P 3J1, or email us at CA-Donors@wwfcanada.org.

WWF-Canada will not otherwise disclose your personal information for purposes other than those, for which it was collected, except as may be permitted or required by law, or with your consent. 

**Consent**

It is important to us that we only collect, use or disclose your personal information which is not publicly available, where we have your consent to do so. Depending on the sensitivity of the personal information, your consent may by implied, deemed (using an opt-out mechanism) or express. Express consent can be given orally, electronically, or in writing, Implied consent is consent that can be reasonably be inferred from your action or inaction. 

We collect, use and disclose personal information only for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate. Regularly, our donors are given opportunities to choose how often and in what way they wish to hear from us. At any time, our supporters are able to opt out of receiving communication material. Also, our supporters are able to opt out of having their information used or shared for purposes beyond those for which it was collected. To update your preferences, please contact a WWF-Canada Donor Relations team member at **1-800-26-PANDA** , or write to us at WWF-Canada, Donor Relations, 410-245 Eglinton Avenue East, Toronto, ON, M4P 3J1, or email us at CA-Donors@wwfcanada.org.

Typically, we seek your consent at the time that we collect the personal information. In certain circumstances, your consent may be obtained after collection but prior to its use or disclosure. If we plan to use or disclose your personal information for a purpose not previously identified, we will advise you of this purpose before such use or disclosure. 

We may collect, use or disclose your personal information without your knowledge or consent where we are permitted or required to do so by applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
