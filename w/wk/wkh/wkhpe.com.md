**How does Wolters Kluwer use the information I provide online?**

The information we collect from general browsing allows us to see which areas of our web site are most visited and helps us better understand our visitors' experiences at LWW.com.

The personal information we collect will allow us to present you with a more customized experience on LWW.com, including offers that relate to the specialty you select, search results presented first by your designated specialty, and faster checkout. The information is also used to send you order confirmations and information about Wolters Kluwer.

When you supply your e-mail address, we use it to confirm your order, provide requested information, and otherwise respond to your communication.

**Does LWW.com share or sell my information with third parties?**

LWW.com does not sell personal information that we collect to third parties. The information we collect is used to acknowledge and deliver items that customers order, to improve the content of our website, to notify visitors who request specific information about updates to our website (i.e. new products in a specific category), and to contact visitors (with permission) for our own marketing purposes. We work with reputable third parties to assist us in delivering services to you. In these instances, we will provide your personal information to third parties so that they can perform these services. Third parties are required to hold the information in confidence and use it only for the purpose of delivering the service for which they were hired.
