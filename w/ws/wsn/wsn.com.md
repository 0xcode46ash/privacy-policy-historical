Privacy Policy for WSN.com  
Effective Date: May 1st 2005

TGG International Holdings Limited (“TGG”) and any and all entities that are controlled by, or are affiliated or under common control with TGG are collectively referred to herein as "we," "us" or "our". We refer to our customers as "visitors." When this Privacy Policy uses the term "personally identifiable information," we mean information that identifies a particular individual, such as the individual's name, postal address, e-mail address and telephone number. When other information, such as, for example, consumer product preferences, or number of children, is directly associated with personally identifiable information, this other information also becomes personally identifiable information for purposes of this Privacy Policy. Personally identifiable information is sometimes referred to in this Privacy Policy as "personal information." Finally, the terms of this Privacy Policy are subject to all applicable laws.

In the event of there being a discrepancy between the English language version of this policy and any other language version, the English language version will be deemed to be correct.

  * **Q1.** What information does this Privacy Policy cover?
  * **Q2.** What types of personal information may we collect?
  * **Q3.** How may we use and share your personal information that we collect?
  * **Q4.** How will you know if we amend this Privacy Policy?



**Scope of Privacy Policy**

**Q1.** What information does this Privacy Policy cover?
    **A1.** This Privacy Policy applies to all personally identifiable information that we collect, on or after the effective date of this Privacy Policy, from individuals who provide us such information for the purpose of obtaining from us a product or service primarily for personal, family or household purposes. 

**Information We Collect**

**Q2.** What types of personal information may we collect?
    **A2.** We may collect various types of personal information. For example, we may receive personal information that comes directly from visitors who are interested in obtaining various products and services from us. This information may include the guest's name, postal address, e-mail address and telephone number. We also may collect other types of information such as gender, age, number of children, and personal interests, which we may associate with personal information. If you purchase products or services from us, we may note, for example, credit card information, the type of services or products ordered or purchased, and the date of the order or purchase. In addition, we may collect personal information from you if you participate in sweepstakes, contests, games and promotional offers.

**Q3.** How may we use and share your personal information that we collect?
    **A3.** We may use and share your personal information collected under this Privacy Policy in a variety of ways, including, for example:

* We may send you promotional materials, and we may share your personal information with other subsidiaries of TGG and third parties so that they can send you promotional materials. (By "promotional materials," we mean communications that directly promote the purchase of products or services.) These promotional materials may concern our products and services, and/or the products and services of another subsidiary of TGG or a third party. These promotional materials may be sent to you by postal mail, e-mail or other means.

* We may use your personal information for purposes other than sending you promotional materials. For example, we may use your information to complete transactions requested by you, or to send you administrative communications about any account you may have with us or about future changes to this Privacy Policy.

* We may take your personal information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information). We may use this non-personally identifiable information for, among other purposes, research and analysis to improve our products and services.

* We may hire companies to help deliver products or services, like a shipping company that delivers a package or a company that helps fulfill prizes for a sweepstakes. In those instances, there is a need to share your information with these companies. Sometimes we also may work with other companies who help either gather your information or communicate with you.

* We may disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that such disclosures (a) are required by law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena, or (b) will help to: enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions and/or game rules; protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of property that belongs to you; and/or protect the safety and security of us, other subsidiaries of TGG, and/or third parties, including the safety and security of property that belongs to us, other subsidiaries of TGG or third parties. 

From time to time, we may offer you the opportunity to "opt in" to, or to "opt out" from, certain uses by us of your personal information and/or our sharing of your personal information with other subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company and/or third parties.

**Amendments to Privacy Policy**

**Q4.** How will you know if we amend this Privacy Policy?
    **A4.** We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time. If we amend this Privacy Policy to permit material changes in the way we collect, use and/or share your personal information, we will notify you of such changes by sending you an e-mail at the last e-mail address that you provided to us, and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our Web site. Any such material changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective thirty (30) calendar days following either our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you or our posting of notice of the changes on our Web site. Any such material changes to this Privacy Policy may affect our use and sharing of personal information that you provided to us before our notification to you of the changes. If you do not wish to permit material changes in our collection, use or sharing of personal information that you have provided to us before the effective date of such changes, you must so notify us before that effective date. Please be advised, however, that, regardless of whether you provide such notice to us, the changes to this Privacy Policy will apply to any personal information that you provide to us on or after the effective date of such changes.
