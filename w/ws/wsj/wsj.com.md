Dow Jones & Company, Inc., publisher of WSJ.com, and its affiliates (hereafter referred to collectively as "Dow Jones") are committed to maintaining the privacy of personal information that you provide to us when using WSJ.com and Barrons.com (hereafter referred to collectively as "WSJ.com"). This Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal information received about you when you visit WSJ.com. 

We may make content or services from other Web sites including our affiliated or co-branded Web sites available to you from links located on WSJ.com. These other Web sites are not subject to this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you review the privacy policy at each such Web site to determine how that site protects your privacy. 

**Information We Collect**  
**General** : When you register, and at other times, we will collect personally identifiable information from you that may include your name, age, address, e-mail address, credit-card number and facts about your computers, profession, investing habits and similar information. We do not, however, knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen. 

**Surveys** : We may conduct occasional online surveys. For example, when you're within our Web site, you may see a pop-up window offering you the optional opportunity of participating in a survey. These surveys are entirely voluntary and you may easily decline to participate. 

**Web Site Usage Information** : We automatically collect IP addresses and Web site usage information from you when you visit our Web site. This information helps us evaluate how our visitors and subscribers use and navigate our Web sites on an aggregate basis, including the number and frequency of visitors and subscribers to each Web page, and the length of their visits. 

**How We Use Information Collected**  
We may use information in the following ways:   


  * For the purposes for which you specifically provided the information including, for example, to enable us to process, validate and verify subscriptions. 
  * To send you e-mail notifications about our new or existing products and services, special offers, or to otherwise contact you. 
  * To enhance existing features or develop new features, products and services. 
  * To provide advertisers and other third parties with aggregate information about our user base and usage patterns. 
  * To allow us to personalize the content and advertising that you and others see based on personal characteristics or preferences. 

We may combine the information that we collect from you on this Web site with information that you provide to us in connection with your use of our other products, services and Web sites. 

We use third parties, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to deliver ads to you on our behalf. We may also use third-party service providers to contact you on our behalf, or facilitate some aspects of our Web site services, or fulfill your purchase requests. These third-party ad servers and service providers may be supplied with or have access to your personally identifiable information solely for the purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf. 

These third-party ad servers may also collect and use non-personally identifiable information about your visits to this and other web sites in order to present advertisements that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice or to opt out of having this information used by third-party ad servers to provide targeted ads, please visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp>. 

Except as specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your personally identifiable information outside of Dow Jones unless you "opt in" to having your personally identifiable information shared with a company that is not affiliated with us. 

We may disclose and use personally identifiable information in special circumstances where it is necessary to enforce our Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use (for example, when necessary to protect our intellectual property rights). We may also disclose or use your personal information when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires us to do so.
