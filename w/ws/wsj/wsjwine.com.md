# Privacy Policy | WSJwine from The Wall Street Journal

WSJwine (the “Site”) is operated by Direct Wines, Inc. under an agreement between Direct Wines, Inc. and Dow Jones & Company, Inc., publisher of The Wall Street Journal (“We” and “Us”). The Site offers the opportunity to purchase wines for home or office delivery and review related tastings notes.

We know that you, our valued customer, care how your information is used and how your privacy is protected. We are committed to protecting your privacy and have created this policy (the “Privacy Policy”) in order to demonstrate our commitment to that privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information (“PII”) (such as your name, shipping address, email address, telephone number, or credit card number) we obtain from and about visitors to the Site, members of our wine Discovery Club or customers of the Site.

From time to time we may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and use practices, the features of the Site, or technology. Your continued use of the Site after we post a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. It is therefore important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes. If we materially change our practices regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the Privacy Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the change.

The Site is directed to adults ages 21 or older. We do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13 years of age.

**Information We Collect**

We collect PII from you when you voluntarily provide it to us in order to process your orders and club registration, contact you if there is trouble completing or shipping your orders, send you newsletters you have requested, respond to your requests, and inform you of our new products, services and offers. We may also obtain PII from reputable third parties.

In addition, we collect other non-PII including IP address, aggregate user data, Site usage information, and browser type to help diagnose problems with our server, manage and improve the Site, gather demographic information, track usage, and for security and monitoring purposes. This information aids us in merchandising and in developing the design and layout of the Site.

We use "cookies" (small pieces of information placed on your computer hard drive) on certain parts of our Site. Cookies allow websites to remember user activity and visits to a site. We use cookies on the Site to determine the number of unique visitors we host on the Site over any given period of time and to keep track of items placed in the “shopping cart” during a visit to the Site. We do not use cookies to collect PII. You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser. However, by blocking all cookies you may not have access to certain features on the Site.

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads or conduct email campaigns on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness.

We may use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of the Site to PII obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you've asked us to send you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and other data about your activities on the Site may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences. However, if we wish to coordinate your personal and Site activity information in this manner, we will obtain your express affirmative consent.

**Notice About Collection of Information**

When you voluntarily provide your PII to us, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses we will make of the information.

The Site may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of Web sites operated by third parties that are linked to or integrated with the Site or for the privacy practices of third parties. Once you've left the Site via such a link, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you.

**Choice About the Use of Your Information**

Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not use the PII you provide to us for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted without your permission.

**Sharing and Use of Information**

Except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we do not share or sell your PII.

We may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us, including but not limited to Dow Jones and Direct Wines, Inc.

From time to time we may share PII with unaffiliated, third-party businesses that can provide you with valuable offers and information. However, you will always have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information with such third parties when PII is collected.

We work with certain companies that, in conjunction with their own membership programs or rewards programs, require that we disclose purchasing information about their customers who visit our site through links from the partner sites, or use the partner's credit card to make purchases on our Site (e.g., to earn points for purchases made on the Site through links from the partner site). We disclose only the information required to make these programs work and support your membership with them, which typically includes the name and/or email address of the user as well as the dollar amount of purchases made. We disclose this information to companies under an agreement that requires that they obtain your consent first, usually under the membership or participation rules. If you do not want us to disclose that information to the strategic partner, then you must contact them directly.

We may use other companies to perform services including, without limitation, facilitating some aspects of our Site, sending e-mail, fulfilling purchase requests, delivering orders, processing credit cards and payment information, serving, customizing or delivering marketing or ads, and auditing. These other companies may be supplied with or have access to your PII and non-PII solely for the purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf.

There may be instances when we may disclose PII without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of WSJwine and affiliated companies, including Dow Jones and Direct Wines, Inc., or their employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to our site; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if we sell all or part of the business of WSJwine or makes a sale or transfer of assets or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, we may transfer your PII to a third party as part of that transaction.

**Security**

We use commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel, and physical measures to safeguard PII in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification.

**Access**

Whenever possible, you may review and update the PII that you have provided to us by contacting Customer Service at [customerservice@wsjwine.com](mailto:customerservice@wsjwine.com).
