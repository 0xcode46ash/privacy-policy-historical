The FERPA policy is intended to ensure students have the right to inspect and review their education records; the right to amend their education records as appropriate; and the right to control access to their education records. Students have the right to: (1) inspect and review their education records, (2) request amendment to their education records, (3) consent to disclosures of non-directory information, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent, and (4) file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by WGU to comply with FERPA requirements.

Students have the right to request that their records be amended if they believe the content is inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of their privacy rights. Student directory information may be shared with outside institutions and corporations.

For details about WGU’s policy on the use of student information and the procedures WGU has established in accordance with FERPA, please see the [WGU Student Handbook](http://kb.wgu.edu/article.asp?article=1161&p=3). 

Students who do not wish to be listed in the student directory or to be included on WGU mailing lists may send their request via email to [unsubscribe@wgu.edu](mailto:unsubscribe@wgu.edu).
