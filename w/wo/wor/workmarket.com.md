We use cookies to administer and customize our service and to better understand, on an aggregate basis, how users interact with the Work Market Platform. If you choose to disable cookies, you may not be able to use certain features of the Work Market Platform and/or Web Site. As is true of most web sites, when you visit our Site we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.

##### Disclosure

Work Market may share User information with other Users and with third parties that provide the Work Market Platform services, and perform services on our behalf, for example to process credit card payments.
