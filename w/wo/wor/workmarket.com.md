### Cookies and Other Technical Data

##### Our web site also uses “cookies”. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a User’s computer. We use cookies to administer and customize our service and to better understand, on an aggregate basis, how Users interact with the Work Market Platform. We also may use cookies for marketing purposes; for example, they can help in tailoring the communications that we and others send to you, including online ads. You can set your browser to block cookies, or to notify you each time you receive a cookie, allowing you to decide whether or not to accept it. However, if you choose to disable or reject cookies, you may not be able to use certain features of the Work Market Platform and/or Web Site. We also may use âweb beaconsâ on our Site or in our emails. A web beacon is a small electronic file that generally consists of a single-pixel image that is placed on a web page or email and is used to transmit certain types of information. They can help us track your use of the Site and can also provide information about your responses to our emails. As is true of most web sites, when you visit our Site we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. We gather technical information about your computer such as your IP address, operating system, browser type, pages visited, manner of connection to the Internet, and referring URL. We use this information in aggregate to analyze trends and administer our service. 

  


##### Finally, we partner with certain third parties to collect and analyze the information discussed above. These third parties may use web logs or set and access cookies on your computer or other device. For example, the Work Market Platform uses [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html) for the purposes discussed above. The use of cookies by third parties is subject to their own privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy. If you prefer to prevent third parties from setting and accessing cookies on your computer, you may set your browser to block cookies. And you may opt out of the use of cookies by Google Analytics [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

### Disclosure

##### Work Market may share User information with other Users and with third parties that provide the Work Market Platform services, and perform services on our behalf, for example to process credit card payments or to facilitate our operational or promotional communications with Users.

  


##### We may disclose User information to third parties when we believe such disclosure is appropriate to comply with a legal requirement, such as a law, regulation, court order, subpoena or search warrant, or in the course of a legal or regulatory proceeding. We may also disclose User information as we believe appropriate to enforce or apply our rights under our agreements with Users, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Work Market and its Users and others, including exchanging information for fraud detection and prevention.

  


##### If there is a change of control in Work Market’s business (whether by merger, sale, or otherwise), its User information could be sold as part of that transaction and could be used by the purchaser. However, if that business materially changes this statement or the information-handling practices as described in this statement, that business may be required by law to notify you by email and/or through a notice posted on our Site, and to give you a choice as to whether your existing information is used or disclosed in a new manner.
