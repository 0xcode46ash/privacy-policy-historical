# Cheats for Word Cookies: All Answers, Including the New Levels and Categories

This privacy statement describes how ****Firecracker Software LLC**** collects and uses the personal information you provide. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.

_This version of the policy applies to basic apps and services we provide._

## **Location Services**

Some of our services make use of location-based data. If you allow these services, we will collect information about the Wi-fi routers closest to you and the cell IDs of the towers closest to you.

We use this information to provide the requested location-based service, not to identify you. You will be asked for your permission each time a location-based service is requested.

  * Provide you local search results. 
  * Provide you special local offers. 



## **Collection and Use**

****We collect the following personal information from you:****

  * Device Information 
  * Anonymized Crash Reports (stack traces) 
  * Anonymized Usage Data 



As is true of most Web sites and apps, we automatically gather information about your device such as your IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages, and operating system.

****We use this information to:****

  * Improve our products! For example, we collect how long it takes our players to complete the levels in our games, or whether they prefer Board Mode or Classic Mode in Word Breaker. This information helps us identify where our apps can be more clear, practical, and easier to use. 
  * Send you push notifications when you are using our app. If you do not want these notifications, you can manage your preference either through your device or app settings depending on your device type. You can also contact us at [**support@firecrackersw.com**](mailto:support@firecrackersw.com). 
  * Discover crashes and bugs, then fix them. We use [Crashalytics](http://try.crashlytics.com/) to collect this information. 



****Forums****  
Use of the Firecrackersw.com forums requires registration. Firecrackersw.com will never sell, transfer, or make available to any third-party company uniquely identifiable information obtained during the forum registration process. In order to be eligible to use the Firecrackersw.com forums, you must be at least 13 years old.

****Information Obtained from Third Parties  
****If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.

## **Sharing Your Information**

We will share your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. In all other cases, we do not share your personal information.

****We may disclose your personal information****

  * as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process. 
  * when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. 
  * if Firecracker Software LLC is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information. 
  * to any other third party with your prior consent to do so. 



##  ****Third-party Checkout Services****

Depending on your platform, your purchases will be finalized on that platform's Checkout service. You will be providing information such as your credit card number directly to them, not us. We encourage you to read their privacy policies as well, made available on their service pages before and after you commit your purchase.

## **Tracking and Ads**

We partner with third party ad networks such as Amazon Mobile Advertising to either display advertising in our Apps or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partners use technologies to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Apps to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.

Firecrackersw.com uses Google Analytics to collect and report detailed statistics about visits to the site. When you visit our website, Google Analytics servers automatically record and collect Log Data and cookies sent by your browser. This reporting is private. There is more information about this process [on their website](http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/).

## **Security**

When we collect personal information directly from you, we follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
