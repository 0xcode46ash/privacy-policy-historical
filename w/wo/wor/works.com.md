# Works - Privacy Policy

At Works, we are committed to protecting your privacy and safeguarding the security of your online experience. This Policy describes our practices for protecting your privacy as a user of this Internet site. We may modify this Policy from time to time, and you should review it periodically for changes. This policy was last updated on July 12, 2001.

The Information We Collect and How We Use that Information

The only information we collect about your company through your use of this site is the information you voluntarily provide. For example, you can use the site to request additional information about WorksTM products by completing a site questionnaire with information about your company. Basic information you provide, such as company name and contact information, allows us to follow up with you after your visit to the site. Additional information, such as your company's industry, number of employees, and other related information, helps us understand which Works products may be the best fit for your company. Whether you provide all or part of the information requested - or any information at all - is entirely up to you.

The information you provide allows us to respond to your requests for information and to provide you with the highest possible level of customer service. We will not use your information for any other purpose, and will never sell or rent your information to anyone.

Under appropriate circumstances, we may share information with regulatory and law enforcement officials or with our contractors to the extent necessary to investigate or protect against fraud, computer hacking and other illegal activity, or in response to a court order or other legal requirement.

SECURITY

Internet Security

Works incorporates multiple layers of protection to ensure that your information is not accessible to third parties. Network firewalls and intrusion detection systems continuously monitor and filter communications with our systems. Additionally, sensitive information exchanged between your browser and Works is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to prevent that information from being read by others as it travels over the Internet.

Browser Compatibility

Effective use of SSL technology requires use of an SSL-enabled browser such as Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer 4.0 or higher. If you have questions about the security of a specific browser, please refer to that browser's help files or documentation.
