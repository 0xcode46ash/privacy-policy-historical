In order to arrange and manage your travel insurance, we collect your personal, and in some circumstances, your sensitive information, from you directly and those authorised by you such as family members, travelling companions, doctors and hospitals, as well as others we consider necessary including our partners, associates, government entities or service providers.

The personal and sensitive information you provide is used to administer and provide the insurance services, such as providing you with emergency assistance, and to manage your and our rights and obligations in relation to the insurance services, including managing, processing and investigating claims. We may also collect, use and disclose it for product development, marketing, competitions, research, IT systems maintenance and development, recovery against third parties and for any other purposes with your consent or where authorised by law.

Your personal and sensitive information may be disclosed to third parties involved in the above process, such as travel agents and consultants, travel insurance providers, insurers and reinsurers, claims handlers, investigators and cost containment providers, medical and health service providers, legal and other professional advisers, your and our agents and our related companies. Some of these third parties may be located in other countries such as the UK and USA.

When you provide personal information about other individuals, we and our agents rely on you to have made them aware that you are providing the information to us, how they can access it and all other matters described in this Privacy Notice. We rely on you to have obtained their consent on these matters.

You can seek access to and correct your personal information by contacting us. You may not access or correct personal information of others unless you have been authorised by them, or are authorised under law or they are your dependants.

If you have a complaint about your privacy, please contact our Privacy Officer in writing to PO Box A975, Sydney South 1235 or at privacy@worldnomads.com.
