# WorldPay - About Us

When you proceed with a transaction processed by WorldPay you are confirming your acceptance of WorldPay's shopper privacy policy, a copy of which can be viewed below.

**Introduction**  
We (WorldPay Limited) are committed to protecting your privacy as an internet user whenever you buy, or consider buying, goods or services from a supplier who uses the WorldPay payment facilities (or whenever you are making a charitable donation to an organisation which uses those facilities). Your supplier, or the charitable organisation, will generally be using our facilities in connection with payment by you using a credit or debit card (or possibly some other form of payment over the internet). We recognise our responsibility to keep confidential at all times any information about you which we acquire in connection with such a transaction, whether directly from yourself or through the supplier or charitable organisation. WorldPay Limited is owned by The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc. We protect your personal information on the Internet to an equivalent high standard to that which you would experience through any other channels of the bank, such as bank branches, cash machines or on the telephone. Please note however that our responsibility is necessarily limited to protection by us of information which we obtain. We cannot, of course, ourselves control the use or disclosure by your supplier (or the charitable organisation) of any information which they obtain from you.

**Collection of Information**  
To enable us to provide secure payment facilities we will typically acquire information which includes your name, your credit or debit card numbers (with the expiry date) your e-mail and billing addresses, and (where applicable) the delivery address.

**Use and disclosure of Information**  
We use the information which you enter onto the payment page to obtain authorisation to the transaction from the issuer of the credit or debit card and our own or the supplier's bank and to process the payment. The information may be transferred out of the European Union in certain cases for the purposes of processing transactions by us. If this does occur the data will only be transferred to environments equally secure as that provided by us in the UK.

Some details from your transaction (such as your name and email and delivery address, but **never** your card details) are made available to the supplier or charity through our customer management system, which allows them to keep track of what transactions have been made. (These details are available to the supplier or charity wherever they are based; if they are based outside of the European Union then those details will be available to them outside the European Union). Subject to the above, WorldPay will not disclose the information to third parties, or make any use of it, without your permission (unless we are required to do so by statute or by an authorised body in order to aid the investigation or prevention of crime).

**Security**  
WorldPay is committed to protecting the security of your data. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide in computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit sensitive information (such as a credit card number) over the internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

**Cookies**  
Cookies are text files, used by your computer's browser, that store visitor session data. Cookies, by themselves, do not identify the individual user. Cookies are commonly used on the Internet and do not harm your system.

We currently use cookies to collate general management data which is used to plan enhancements to our services. WorldPay **never** stores any personal information in cookies (on any computer that you may use) that can be used to identify you, such as your name or account numbers.

If you do not want us to use cookies you may be able to configure your browser not to accept them. Please refer to your browser's 'help' facility for further information. However, you should bear in mind that this may affect our ability to process the transactions you wish to have authorised.
