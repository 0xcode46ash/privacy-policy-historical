# Privacy Policy — World Science Festival 2008 - Five Day Science Festival In New York City Featuring Nobel Laureates Co-Founded by Brian Greene

## What personally identifiable information is collected about visitors to www.worldsciencefestival.com or www.worldsciencefest.org?

"Personally identifiable information" is non-anonymous information such as your name, phone number, credit card information, address or email address or anything that could identify you personally. Visitors to _www.worldsciencefestival.com_ or _www.worldsciencefest.org_ are not required to provide personally identifiable information to use the Website.

There are three instances in which the Science Festival Foundation (or World Science Festival, WSF) may receive your name, email address, or other information that identifies you personally.

The first is if you contact WSF, for example, to request information. Clicking on a website link in order to contact our organization may result in your email application sending us a query. Such a query would contain your email address and could contain your name.

The second is if you request further information about World Science Festival’s programs. In this case, you may be directed to another website that is hosted by Vertical Response. At the Vertical Response site, you will be governed by the privacy policy of _Vertical Response_ (viewable as of the date of this Privacy Policy at <http://www.verticalresponse.com/about/privacy_tos.html>), not by that of WSF. WSF, however, may still have access to any email address or name you choose to enter at this Vertical Response page.

The third is if you click a button to make a donation to WSF. In this case, you may be directed to another website that is hosted by _Network for Good_ at [guidestar.org](http://guidestar.org/). At the Network for Good site, you will be governed by the privacy policy of Network for Good (viewable as of the date of this Privacy Policy at [http://support.networkforgood.org/?a=4&q=152](http://support.networkforgood.org/?a=4&q=152)), not by that of WSF. WSF, however, may still have access to any email address or name you choose to enter at this Network for Good site.

## What we do and do not do with information we collect:   


We do not rent, sell or distribute your personally identifying information to other companies or individuals, unless we have your consent. We may share such information in any of the following limited circumstances:

  * We have your consent.   

  * We provide such information to trusted businesses or persons for the sole purpose of processing personally identifying information on our behalf. When this is done, it is subject to agreements that oblige those parties to process such information only on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
  * We conclude that we are required by law or have a good faith belief that access, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of WSF, its program participants, website users or the public.   




We may share aggregated information with others. Examples of this include the number of users who searched for certain items on our website or how many users clicked on a particular page of our website.

##  WSF and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”):

It is the policy of WSF to collect through our website NO personally identifiable information from children under the age of 14 years, unless we have received parental consent in connection with such collection of information. All individuals are therefore required to be 14 years or older to submit their email address at our website, or obtain parental consent with respect to the furnishing of that information to us.

## What anonymous information is collected about visitors to www.worldsciencefestival.com or www.worldsciencefest.org?

"Anonymous Information" means information that cannot be traced back to you as a specific individual. WSF receives standard web log information: cookies, referrer IDs, IP addresses and system information. None of this information identifies you personally. It is anonymous and will never be combined or linked to any Personally identifiable information.

## What is a cookie?   


A "cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that websites often store on a user's computer. Cookies do not generally include people's names, email addresses, or other information that identifies you personally; they are used to identify a computer, not a person. Cookie technology is fairly commonplace on the Internet because cookies allow website owners to personalize their service based on a user's preferences. On most browsers, you can ask to be notified by your browser when you receive a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it. WSF does not require that you accept cookies, nor will we intentionally prevent you from using our websites if you decline to accept cookies.

## How does WSF use cookies?

As of March 2008, the WSF Website does not employ cookies

## What is a referrer ID?   


A "referrer ID" is information from your web browser which shows us what URL you linked from. This allows us to see what websites link to _www.worldsciencefestival.com_ and _www.worldsciencefest.org_.This information is automatically gathered by our server. Referrer IDs contain no information that identifies you personally.

## What is an IP address?   


IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to you. They are automatically gathered by our web server when you visit www.worldsciencefestival.com or www.worldsciencefest.org. WSF will not use your IP address to attempt to identify your personal information.

## What is system information?   


System information we gather from our web logs includes time of your visit, type of browser you used, and the operating system, platform and CPU speed of your computer. This kind of anonymous information is routinely sent by your browser when you connect to websites. WSF uses this information only for broad demographic statistics. For example: it tells us what percentage of users have Firefox browsers versus Internet Explorer. You will not be personally identified by this information.

## Will I receive unsolicited commercial email ("spam") as a result of visiting the Website of WSF?

No.
