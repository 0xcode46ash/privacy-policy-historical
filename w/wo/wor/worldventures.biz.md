WorldVentures™ Privacy Policy
Updated and effective November 7, 2011
Privacy Statement
Thank you for visiting www.worldventures.biz (our "Site"). We (WorldVentures Marketing LLC) appreciate the
opportunity to interact with you on the Internet and are committed to protecting and safeguarding your privacy. The
purpose of this Privacy Statement is to inform you about the types of information we might collect from you when you
visit our Site, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding
our use of, and your ability to correct that information.
What Information We Collect and How We Use It
Any information we collect on our Site generally falls into the following two categories: Personally Identifiable Information
and Aggregate Information.
Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that lets us know specifically who you are. In
general, you can visit our Site without telling us who you are or revealing any Personally Identifiable Information. You
may, however, voluntarily provide Personally Identifiable Information (such as name, e-mail address, and country of
origin) for us to contact you, including via e-mail, to respond to your comments or inquiries. In such event, we might
maintain a record of your contact, including such Personally Identifiable Information, in a file specific to you. We use this
information to provide better service in the event you contact us again.
Aggregate Information: This refers to information that does not by itself identify you as a specific individual. Such
information would include the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the Web site that referred you to our Site, your
Internet Protocol ("IP") address (a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Web), your
operating system and browser type, and any search terms that you enter on our Site. Our Web server aggregates this
information in order to monitor the level of activity on our Site, evaluate its effectiveness, and improve the content of
our Site in order to make your visit an easy and enjoyable experience.
We may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, or otherwise disclose or use any Aggregate Information,
provided that, such information does not personally identify you. We do not correlate any Personally Identifiable
Information with the Aggregate Information that we collect on our Site. If we do correlate any Aggregate Information
to you, it will be protected like any other Personally Identifiable Information under this Privacy Statement.
Sharing Your Information
Except as disclosed in this Privacy Statement, we do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise retransmit any Personally
Identifiable Information we collect online unless we have your permission. Any Personally Identifiable Information
you provide to us will be stored in our databases in the United States.
We may share Personally Identifiable Information you provide online with other WorldVentures-related entities and/or
trusted business partners with whom we collaborate on our Site functions and activities, as well as those that provide
services to our Site. Where we engage non-affiliated third-party agents or contractors for these purposes, we will require
them to also protect the confidentiality and integrity of your Personally Identifiable Information and observe the intent of
this Privacy Statement.
From time to time, we may be required to provide Personally Identifiable Information in response to court order,
subpoena, or government investigation. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that
we in good faith believe to be unlawful. We may release Personally Identifiable Information when we believe that such
release is reasonably necessary to enforce or apply our Terms of Use or to protect the rights, property, and safety of
others and ourselves.
WorldVentures or its related entities could merge with or be acquired by another business entity, or its respective assets
could be acquired. Should such a merger or acquisition occur, you should expect that we would share some or all of
your Personally Identifiable Information to companies serving you and other users of our Site.
Your Choices
Your permission is always secured first. We will not use or share the Personally Identifiable Information collected on our
Site in ways unrelated to the purpose for which you provided the information, including those described above, without
providing you a choice whether to permit any such unrelated uses.


Accessing and Correcting Your Information
We take reasonable measures to ensure that any Personally Identifiable Information we collect on our Site is accurate,
current, complete, and reliable for its intended use. If you wish to update or otherwise correct Personally Identifiable
Information you have provided to us, you may contact us as described in the "Contact Us" section, below.
Protecting Your Information
We acknowledge your trust and are committed to take reasonable steps to protect Personally Identifiable Information you
provide online from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access. We employ physical, electronic, and managerial processes
to safeguard and secure your information.

By visiting the site, you agree that we may retain and process the personal information given by you to us for purposes

and transfer such personal information to other affiliates and associates of the WorldVentures group of companies which
are situated inside and outside of the EEA and to other persons for the purposes of WorldVentures’ business including
other WorldVentures Representatives. These persons may be situated in countries that do not have laws to protect
personal information. Details of the companies and countries involved will be provided on request.
