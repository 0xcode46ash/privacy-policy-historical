# Privacy Policy

## We respect your privacy

We respect your privacy and do not tolerate spam and will never sell, rent, lease or give away your information (name, address, email, etc.) to any third party (see below for "Financial information" and "Does Wordtracker share information?"). Nor will we send you unsolicited email.

If you choose to give your name and email address into one or more of our site's registration forms, then we will send you emails relating to the mailing list(s) or service(s) you joined and the Keyword Expert newsletter, as well as marketing offers from time to time. You may opt out of receiving future mailings from our mailing lists; see the choice/opt-out section below.

Financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date) is used only to charge you for the service you are purchasing. This will never be given to any third party (other than the credit card authorization processor [Secure Trading](http://securetrading.com/)). For trial users only we hold the credit card number (1-way encrypted - even we can't read it) in order to restrict over-use. We hold only 4 digits of the credit card number for all credit card purchases. If you tick the box "Please automatically renew my subscription", then the credit card authorization processor holds the credit card number.

## How do we protect your information?

In order to prevent unauthorized access, Wordtracker uses strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given to us. We take all reasonable precautions to ensure the security of personal data stored on our system.

All your personal information is password-protected - only registered users and Wordtracker support staff have access to this information. As a registered user, you will be able to edit or delete your personal information details at any time using your own ID and password.

## Does Wordtracker share information?

Your personal information is being provided only to Wordtracker unless we specifically state otherwise. We will not disclose your personally identifiable information to any person or company except where you have given us permission to do so or if the law requires it, or where in good faith Wordtracker believes such action is necessary to comply with a legal process.

## What About Cookies?

Cookies are pieces of information that an interactive service (e.g. website, digital TV) transfers to your hardware (e.g. computer, set-top box, etc.) for recordkeeping purposes. Wordtracker may use cookies where appropriate within the site. In order to use the full functionality of the Wordtracker site, particularly the Members' area, you could enable cookies for "wordtracker.com". This is to optimize your experience, storing personal preferences in order to tailor content for you. This information is not viewable by third parties.

## Non-Personally Identifiable Information

The Wordtracker website also collects and uses information in aggregate form to track the number of visitors to each page of our site, the visitor's IP address, and other such technical information. This technical information does not by itself identify a specific individual, except for a user's login ID. We use this data to better target our marketing efforts and to restrict automated tools from using our website.
