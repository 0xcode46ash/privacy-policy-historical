This site is operated by Working Not Working, LLC (“Working Not Working”, “we” or “us”). Working Not Working is committed to protecting your privacy.  Please read this Privacy Policy and accompanying [Terms of Use](http://support.workingnotworking.com/customer/portal/articles/330135-terms-of-use) carefully.  By submitting information, creating an account (an “Account”), utilizing our services (the “Services”) or otherwise accessing or using the Working Not Working website (the “Website”), you acknowledge that you have read, accepted and consented to be bound by the practices and policies outlined herein.  Our Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time.  We will post any changes here, and any changes will become effective immediately upon being posted.  Use of information we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.  It is your responsibility to check periodically for any changes we may make to this Privacy Policy and the [Terms of Use](http://support.workingnotworking.com/customer/portal/articles/330135-terms-of-use). Your continued use of the Website following the posting of any changes constitutes your unconditional acceptance of any such changes.

**What is Covered in This Privacy Policy?**

  
This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information (together with “Submitted Information” (as defined herein), the “Personal Information”) that Working Not Working gathers when you access the Website and when you use the Services or register for an Account. Furthermore, this Privacy Policy covers the treatment of any Personal Information that Working Not Working shares with its business partners. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of entities that Working Not Working does not own or control, nor to individuals that Working Not Working does not employ or manage.

**What Personal Information is Collected by Working Not Working?**

The types of Personal Information collected include, without limitation, your full name, address, phone number, website URL, e-mail address, blog or other personal website URL, your nickname or screen name, and any other information that would allow Working Not Working to identify you or contact you if needed.  We also may collect information you provide us when signing up for an Account and/or the Services, and information you provide when you contact us online (i.e., by providing feedback, support queries, sales questions, etc.) or offline (i.e., phone or mail).

The Personal Information you provide may be used:

  
to provide you with requested information, content or the Services;

  
to notify you about new product and service offerings;

  
to enforce the [Terms of Use](http://support.workingnotworking.com/customer/portal/articles/330135-terms-of-use) of this Website and to address any problems or concerns we have regarding your use of the Website;

  
to provide attribution to comments you post; and

  
for internal purposes, such as system administration, marketing analysis, and to better operate the Website and deliver the Services.

  
In addition, we may ask you to provide certain other information such as general demographic information, including, without limitation, age, gender, ZIP code, preferences and interests. The information we gather from our users enables us to personalize and improve the Services.

**Information Collected Automatically**  

  
Working Not Working may receive and store certain types of information whenever you use the Website and/or the Services. We may choose to automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, “cookies”, and the page you requested.  We use “cookies” to store session information, for keeping your login/password information live (if you so choose) for your account, to limit multiple responses and registrations, to enhance website navigation, and to track and analyze usage patterns on the Website.  Cookies are small text files a website uses to recognize repeat users, which are typically placed on your hard disk by a web page server.  Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. The way cookies function is by assigning a number to the user that has no meaning outside of the assigning website.  Working Not Working cannot control the use of cookies (or the resulting information) by our third-party partners or advertisers.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer.  If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of the Website and the Service that depend on cookies.

**Information from Social Networking Websites**

By registering for an Account, you may have the option to sign in using third party social networking websites (collectively, the “Social Networks”), such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn.  If you choose to sign in through these Social Networks, we use the information you have already provided to such Social Networks in registering for an account with such Social Networks and which you have allowed such Social Networks to share with us, including, but not limited to, your first name, your user profile picture, your friends and contacts list, and the networks to which you belong (collectively, your “Submitted Information”).

You expressly authorize us to collect and use your Submitted Information in connection with your use of the Services. You further acknowledge and agree that Working Not Working may, but is not obligated to, maintain copies of your Submitted Information indefinitely, or delete any or all Submitted Information, at our sole discretion.

It is your responsibility to carefully read and accept the terms of use and privacy policies of each of the Social Networks prior to signing into your Account through such Social Networks.

**Sharing of Personal Information**

  
Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, your Personal Information will be used only by Working Not Working and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates, and your Personal Information will not be disclosed to any other third party without your consent.  

  
Working Not Working occasionally hires other companies to provide limited administrative and communication services on our behalf, such as hosting websites, the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, or performing statistical analysis. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only such Personal Information as necessary for them to deliver their services. Those companies are required to maintain the confidentiality of the Personal Information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information for such purposes.

  
Working Not Working (or substantially all of its assets) may be acquired by, sold to, consolidated or merged with another entity. In such an event, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that such successor entities may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

  
Working Not Working may access and/or disclose Personal Information without your prior consent if we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (i) comply with legal process or other legal requirements of any governmental authority; (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Working Not Working (including the enforcement of our agreements); (iii) enforce the [Terms of Use](http://support.workingnotworking.com/customer/portal/articles/330135-terms-of-use); (iv) operate or conduct maintenance and repair of the Services or equipment as authorized by law; or (v) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or members of the public.

**Advertisements Displayed by Third Parties**

  
Working Not Working may allow third-party ad serving companies, including ad networks, to display advertisements on the Website.  Ad serving companies may place a persistent cookie on your computer in order to recognize your computer each time they display an online advertisement to you, and as such, they may be able to compile information over time about whether you reviewed or clicked on advertisements they display. These ad serving companies may use this information to display targeted advertisements and may associate this information with your subsequent visits, purchases or other activities on participating advertisers’ websites. Working Not Working has no access to or control over such websites or ad serving companies, nor does Working Not Working have control over or access to cookies by Working Not Working’s third-party partners or advertisers. This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of Personal Information that a third-party advertiser or ad server may collect from you.

**Security and Protection of Personal Information**

  
Working Not Working maintains reasonable standards of security and confidentiality, including limiting access to Personal Information stored in our database. However, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that data transmissions won’t be unlawfully intercepted or accessed while being transmitted to the Website over the internet.  We make no warranty regarding the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.  

  
Do not disclose your password or confirmation number (as applicable) to anyone. Whenever you post information about yourself on any website (including the Website), that information could be viewed, collected and used by third parties.  We bear no responsibility for any action or policies of any third-parties who collect any information that you elect to publicly disclose on the Website.

  
We offer the use of a secure server.  Payment information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.  Our payment gateway provider is STRIPE. STRIPE has been audited by a PCI-certified auditor, and is certified to [PCI Service Provider Level 1](http://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/cisp-list-of-pcidss-compliant-service-providers.pdf). This is the most stringent level of certification available.  STRIPE’S Privacy Policy can be found here: [https://stripe.com/privacy](https://stripe.com/privacy).  Please review it prior to submitting any payments.  After a transaction, your private information pertaining to such transaction will not be stored on our servers.

You may leave our Website by clicking on certain links on our Website.  These links may take you to third-party online content that is not operated by us and that is beyond our control.  We are not responsible for the content of any third-party websites to which you choose to link.  In addition, these websites have their own privacy policies and practices that may differ from ours, and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of and practices of any such websites prior to use.

**Opt Out**

  
You have the ability at any time to access, update or delete your Account.  You should be aware, however, that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our database without some residual data remaining due to backups and other reasons.  Please also keep in mind that any opt-out choices you make will not apply in situations where: (a) you make a specific request for information from us, or (b) we use your Personal Information to send you administrative communications about your Account.
