This site is incredible. It's been a great help to me in keeping touch with my family back home as well as my friends in South Africa, Paris, and Argentina. Thanks!

I was having a difficult time in scheduling a meeting for our sales reps in the UK and US... and coordinating it with the customer, who was located in the Philippines. This website is fantastic! Very easy to use-better than the other sites I was trying to use.

I work on projects supporting different GEOs around the world. This was THE site I was expecting to equate IST to any TZ or vice versa. Excellent Work. Thanks...
