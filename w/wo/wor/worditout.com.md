# Privacy and Cookie Policy - WordItOut

Enideo believes strongly in protecting the privacy of the information you share with us. We also believe that it is important to inform you about how we will use such information. Therefore, we encourage you to read this document carefully. This Privacy and Cookie Policy applies to any information you provide to us by using this Website.

## 1\. What information is collected

We do not collect information about the specifics of who you are (“Personally Identifiable Information“) unless you specifically provide to us this personal data.

### 1.1. Automatic, anonymous information

We automatically receive and save certain types of information whenever you interact with this Website. This information is not used to develop a personal profile of you and none of this information is Personally Identifiable Information.

Examples of information we may track include, but are not limited to: your Internet protocol address; the kind of browser or device you use; links you click within the site; date and time of your visit; web pages from which you link to our site; pages you view on our site.

### 1.2. Information you provide

If you alter a setting on the Website, we may save your preference.

When you save or modify User Content, you provide us with the information required to store and manage your User Content. Please be aware that you should exercise caution before deciding to disclose voluntarily your own personal data in User Content that can be viewed by the public.

Sometimes we may request you to provide some Personally Identifiable Information, such as your email address. See below for details on how we use your information.

## 2\. How information is collected

As when you visit almost all websites, web servers automatically log information.

Like many websites, we may send cookies, a small text file, to your device. As an example, the type of information that might be stored in a cookie could be a randomly assigned, anonymous identification number.

To store data on your device or track usage of the Website, similar web technologies may be used such as browser web storage, web beacons and application data caches.

Databases are used to store User Content and information related to your User Content.

If you send us email messages or use a form to contact us, we may send that information by email and store it on email servers.

## 3\. How we use your information

We may use web server logs to resolve security issues, to troubleshoot technical problems or to analyse Website usage.

Cookies and similar technologies may be used to save preferences, to compile usage statistics, to target advertisements or to optimise the Website.

We may require your email address so that we can identify who created the User Content as we may need to contact you about it. For example, we may have to contact you to provide you with a unique URL in order to to manage your User Content or to notify you that a particular service you use has been changed or suspended.

You may also be asked to disclose personal data to us so that we can provide assistance to you; for example, such data may be warranted in order to provide technical support and troubleshooting.

## 4\. How we manage your information

### 4.1. Sharing information

Enideo will keep your Personally Identifiable Information confidential except with your permission or under special circumstances, including: when required by law; to fulfill your service request. We may transfer, sell or assign any of the information described in this policy to third parties as a result of a sale, merger, consolidation, change of control, transfer of assets or reorganisation of our business. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful, including but not limited to enforcing the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/legal/terms).

Enideo will not use your personal data for marketing.

We will not sell, trade or rent Personally Identifiable Information to third parties. However, we reserve the right to share aggregated site statistics with third parties, such as advertisers on this Website. We may engage third parties to process data on our behalf but will require these third parties to comply strictly with this Privacy and Cookie Policy and Enideo will require that they do not use your personal information for their own business purposes.

### 4.2. Security of Information

Once transmitted to us, we will keep your Personally Identifiable Information secure consistent with current industry standards. However, data transmission over the Internet is not completely secure and any transmission is at your own risk.

Some Content is limited-access, where access is gained through an obscured URL system. This obscured URL makes it difficult if not impossible for a third party to guess this URL address. We also monitor and try to block automated requests to such pages, to prevent any unauthorized access. However, because these web pages are not password-protected, a possibility exists that an unauthorized third party could discover them.

You should send or share these links only to people authorized to view such Content. If you are using a shared device, we recommend that you delete your web browsing history. For the protection of your privacy, we do not put Personally Identifiable Information on any such Content.

### 4.3. Retention of Information

Log files are regularly purged and other information is only kept as long as required. Data such as User Content in databases may be archived at intermittent periods and old archives purged when no longer required.

## 5\. How you can manage your information

### 5.1. Cookies and similar technologies

The following links provide help for popular web browsers: [Firefox](https://google.com/search?q=configure+firefox+cookies); [Chrome](https://google.com/search?q=configure+chrome+cookies); [Internet Explorer](https://google.com/search?q=configure+internet+explorer+cookies).
