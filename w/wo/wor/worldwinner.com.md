**Online Tournaments Privacy Policy**  
Powered by WorldWinner.com  


  
**Your Privacy**

WorldWinner.com is committed to protecting your privacy. WorldWinner.com uses the information collected about you to track your tournament records and to provide a more personalized game playing experience. Please read on for more details about the WorldWinner.com privacy policy.

**What information does WorldWinner.com collect? How is it used?**

When you participate in Rookie and Training tournaments, WorldWinner.com needs only to collect your email address and ask you to create a User Name that may be displayed on tournament winner lists. Collecting your email allows WorldWinner.com to send you announcements if you win the tournaments that you participate in and to invite you to participate in invitation-only tournaments.

When you participate in our Big Money tournaments, WorldWinner.com needs your real name, email address, credit card number, expiration date, and billing address. This allows WorldWinner.com to process tournaments you wish to participate in and to reward prizes that you win or money that you withdraw from your WorldWinner.com Account.

When you submit a bug, suggestion, complaint, question, request, or any other email correspondence, WorldWinner.com asks for your email address so that you can receive a response.

If you win a prize or other promotional feature, WorldWinner.com may ask for your real name, mailing address, and e-mail address so that you can be notified and arrange for delivery.

By registering for an account, you agree that WorldWinner.com may display your user name and tournament records. From time to time, (and usually when you win a prize), WorldWinner.com may ask you to voluntarily provide general demographic and other personal information for inclusion on the WorldWinner.com "Winners" page. See section 2.5 under "official rules" for details about this.

In addition, WorldWinner.com also reserves the right to use the information collected to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the Web site, new services, and special offers you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, contact [customer service](https://web.archive.org/help/).

**How does WorldWinner.com protect customer information?**  
When you play games or access your account information, WorldWinner.com offers the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to WorldWinner.com or sent to you. Furthermore, all of the customer data collected is protected against unauthorized access through the most up-to-date industry-standard security measures.

**Will WorldWinner.com disclose the information it collects to outside parties?**  
WorldWinner.com does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. WorldWinner.com may release account information when WorldWinner.com believes, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any user agreements or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of WorldWinner.com, WorldWinner.com users, or others.

**How does WorldWinner.com allow customers to update, change, or correct the information it collects?**  
Click "My Account" and select "Change Email". Here you will find options for email messages.

**Will I need to provide my social security number?**  
If your total winnings on the Site in any given year reach $600, WorldWinner.com will request that you submit your social security number in order to send you a Form 1099, as required by Internal Revenue Service regulations. Failure to provide your social security number at that time will result in the Site's inability to credit your account for any winnings in excess of $600.

**Your consent**  
By using the WorldWinner.com web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by WorldWinner.com. If the WorldWinner.com privacy policy changes, those changes will be posted on this page so that you are always aware of what information is collected, how the information is used, and under what circumstances the information is disclosed.

**Tell us what you think**  
WorldWinner.com welcomes your questions and comments about privacy. Please contact [customer service](https://web.archive.org/help/).
