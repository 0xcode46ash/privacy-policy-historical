The information collected is used to market and improve the services we offer, to improve the Workforce.com Web site content, and to contact you with updates to the Web site, provide you with subscribed deliverables, or for other marketing purposes.

Certain areas of Workforce.com, including but not limited to subscriptions, forums, discussions, comments and pay areas, require registration or a password for access. Information obtained from registered users of these areas may also be used for Mediatec Publishing Inc. marketing purposes, and cookies may be used in those and other areas, as is described in this Policy. Information obtained in these areas may also be used in accordance with agreements governing access to and use of the specific areas. In addition, visitors to Workforce.com may choose to register for a Workforce.com Login user ID and password to gain access to some interactive features on Workforce.com. Log file data and other information gathered from registered users of Workforce.com are used to improve the Workforce.com customer experience. When attending our in-person events, participating in our customer-sponsored webcasts, using portions of our Web sites and signing up for elected services (eg. free subscriptions), users must first register.

Mediatec Publishing Inc. provides some clients with customized, private label, sponsored products and services, or when we join with other parties to provide specific services or events (we do not share credit card information with such third parties), then we may share (provide and receive) information about our customers with such third party, subject to the customer's preferences (as described in the "Permission" section below). Information collected in connection with online webcasts/seminars, will be shared with the sponsor of the particular webcast(s)/seminar(s), subject to the given customer's preferences (as described in the "Permission" section below).

**What information does Mediatec Publishing Inc. capture about visitors to its Web sites?**  
The Workforce.com Web server uses an extended log file format which captures: date and time of visit, referring address (location from which a visitor comes to Workforce.com), type of Internet browser, and visitor's IP address. (Each computer that connects to the Internet is assigned a unique number, an IP address, for identification purposes). The log file does not capture a visitor's email address or passwords. For services that require payment (eg. certain events, products and subscriptions), we also collect credit card information (eg. account name, number and expiration date). We may collect unique identifiers (eg. mother's maiden name) that we disclose to the auditors strictly for industry standard reporting and audit verification purposes.

**Does Mediatec Publishing Inc. ask for personal information?**  
Several areas of Workforce.com ask for personal information. In these areas, your name, address, email address, billing information, and business profile are requested. This information is collected to help us further develop our services, to provide you access to valuable Mediatec Publishing Inc. Internet-based information and services, provide you with our printed magazines and publications, and to bill you for pay services if you elect to use them. We also may collect information about a user's professional responsibilities (eg. job title and purchasing responsibilities, company information and professional certification).

**How does Mediatec Publishing Inc. use the information?**  
The information collected through this Web site helps us identify the type of Web site content our customers value most.

Our policy is to not give, sell or otherwise distribute the information collected through this site to third parties outside of Mediatec Publishing Inc. (unless required by law); provided, however, in some cases we may use suppliers to assist us in collecting, using or otherwise processing for our benefit the information obtained through this Web site(eg.Independent auditors may need to certify the eligibility of service subscribers). Our practice is to require our suppliers to conduct such activities consistent with this policy and our requirements; Subject to the given customer's preferences (as described in the "Permission" section below).

**Communications from MediaTec**  
In order to best serve our customers, we may send updates that contain important information about our products and services. We may also communicate with a customer to provide requested services and for account-related issues via e-mail, phone or regular mail. In addition to such service and product-essential messages, we offer our customers the option to receive information about our company, related products, services and special deals. Users, however, can choose not to receive these communications from us, as set forth in the "Permission" section below.

**Permission**  
Mediatec Publishing Inc. customers are given the opportunity to choose whether to receive information from our affiliates and us not directly related to the product or service for which they registered (or which they otherwise agreed to receive). Customers have the opportunity to choose whether to have personal information shared with third parties for marketing purposes. Customers can change their preferences at any time. Please note that we have a number of brands and products. You may choose to opt-out of certain brands and products selectively or for all our lists.

Please note that we will endeavor to implement your permission requests within a reasonable time, although for a time you may continue to receive mailings, etc., transmitted based on information released prior to the implementation of your request. In addition, please note that even after such request is implemented, you will continue to receive information directly related to the product or service for which you registered (or which you otherwise agreed to receive), so you always are kept informed.

**What happens when I leave Workforce.com to visit a Workforce linked Web site?**  
Parts of Workforce.com, consist of products and services hosted by third-party businesses. When you leave Workforce.com to visit one of these sites, the only information transferred to the third-party is the fact that you came from Workforce.com (the referring address). This practice allows the third-party to monitor its own Web site traffic, but does not provide them with any information about you. Mediatec Publishing Inc. is not responsible or liable for the independent privacy policies of our third-party sites and sponsors.

All data available through the use of Web beacons is in most cases already gathered by the serving Web server's log files.
