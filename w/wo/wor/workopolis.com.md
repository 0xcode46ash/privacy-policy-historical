WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT? 

**Anonymous browsing**  
You can visit this Site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself, including your email address. In this case, our Web server may collect the name, address, the IP address and domain you used to access this Site, the type and version of browser and operating system you are using, and the web site you came from and visit next. This information is used by us and our business partners to measure the number of visits, average time spent, page views, and other statistics about visitors to this Site in general. We may also use this data to monitor site performance for systems administration purposes, to make this Site easier and more convenient to use and to report information in aggregate form to our advisers (e.g. how many visitors log in to this Site).   


**Cookies**   
Cookies are small pieces of data stored by your Internet browser on your computer's hard drive, which permits us to recognize you when you access this Site. If you are browsing, a cookie is used to help us measure the number of visits, average time spent, page views, and other statistics relating to your use of this Site. If you are searching, a cookie is used to carry the search request data from the request page to the results page. This cookie, by itself, doesn't tell us your email address or who you are. If you decide to register on-line with us, we may collect additional information to provide tailored job opportunities or other information to you (see Personal Information Collection below). In this case, we use cookies to recognize you on subsequent visits and make your on-line experience more convenient, unless prohibited by law.

### PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTION, USE AND DISTRIBUTION TO THIRD PARTIES

**Generally**  
There are times when we may ask you for or you may choose to provide information about yourself or your business to assist us in meeting your various needs. This information may be used for the following purposes: answering your questions, providing you with services you have requested, giving producers and developers of the Site information that is useful in determining appropriate new features, content and services, to provide advertisers with aggregate, not individual, information about our customers, or informing you of additional services or job opportunities provided by Workopolis or by our business partners, that may interest you. 

To provide these services, we may need to ask you directly to provide, among other things, your name, mailing address, postal code, email address and phone number ("Registration Information"). Workopolis is a partnership of The Globe and Mail and The Toronto Star. As such, Workopolis is part of the [Globe Interactive](http://www.globeinteractive.com/) or [globeandmail.com](http://www.globeandmail.com/) family of web sites and services. Once you register with Workopolis you are automatically registered for all other Globe Interactive services. Your Registration Information may be shared, _for internal purposes only_ , so that you do not need to re-register with any services that require registration on Globe Interactive sites. The Globe Interactive sites currently are as follows: [globefund.com](http://www.globefund.com/), [globeinvestor.com](http://www.globeinvestor.com/), [globebooks.com](http://www.globebooks.com/), [globeandmail.com](http://www.globeandmail.com/), [globemegawheels.com](http://www.globemegawheels.com/), [robtv.com](http://www.robtv.com/), [robmagazine.com](http://www.robmagazine.com/) and [globetechnology.com](http://www.globetechnology.com/) (collectively the "Globe Interactive Sites"). Each of the Globe Interactive Sites has its own privacy policy, which may vary from that of Workopolis. We encourage you to review the other Globe Interactive Sites' privacy policies to understand their procedures for collecting, using and disclosing information. By registering with Workopolis, you agree that your Registration Information may be shared with the Globe Interactive Sites and used in accordance with their privacy policies. If you do not wish your Registration Information to be shared with the other Globe Interactive Sites, you should not register with Workopolis. What information is shared? Your user name, password and postal code -- **not any of the personal information** you supply when you add a resumé to "My workopolis". (please refer to our further Privacy Policy with respect to Resumés for more information)

You may also elect to apply on-line to a job posting or to purchase one of our services, which may require us to gather additional information for third parties (including credit information) to determine your eligibility. At times, we also conduct on-line surveys to better understand the needs, profiles, and experience of our visitors. You will be given the option to participate in such surveys. Unless you request to receive the results of the survey via email, no personal information is requested during such surveys and all information is used on an aggregated basis only. If, during the registration process, you indicated you would like us to keep you updated on new site developments, and information about our services or about offerings from Workopolis and/or globeandmail.com or Torstar Media group, we will send you these updates by email. If you contact Workopolis we may keep a record of that correspondence. We do not collect any email addresses of those who communicate with Workopolis via email. We use the information provided only so that we may respond to the email. 

We do not knowingly solicit information from children and we do not knowingly market our services to children. 

When you provide information to us, we may communicate and disclose your information to third parties for the purpose of fulfilling, servicing and completing your requests and the transactions related to it. These third parties may be in Canada or in other parts of the world. 

We may also aggregate statistics that we gather about the visitors to the Site, sales, traffic patterns, and services and provide these statistics to third parties; however, when we do, these statistics will not include any personal information that identifies individuals. 

We may also use, disclose and communicate your personal information if required to do so by law including by an order of any court.

Although we use all reasonable means to ensure that the information you provide to us is not used by third parties for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy, Workopolis is not responsible for any improper use of your personal information that is beyond our reasonable control.   


**Resume Collection**  
As part of the services we provide, you may choose to provide us with your resume, to be viewed by various organizations who access this Website. In addition to the provisions of this Privacy Policy, the collection, use and distribution of your resume is governed by the terms set out at http://www.workopolis.com/content/home/terms.html 

### HOW DO YOU ACCESS AND UPDATE YOUR INFORMATION?

Workopolis provides you with the means to access, update, edit or delete the Registration Information you have provided to us at any time on your own by going to [http://www.workopolis.com](http://www.workopolis.com/) and changing or deleting the Registration Information contained in My Workopolis as desired. If you decide at any time that you do not want to receive any updates you have subscribed for just send an email message to comments@workopolis.com, indicating your preference not to receive updates. If you are unsure whether we have a record containing your personal information and would like to confirm whether or not we do, please send an email at comments@workopolis.com, indicating all email addresses which you may have given us.   


### HOW IS YOUR INFORMATION SECURED AND PROTECTED?

Where Workopolis considers it appropriate, Workopolis uses encryption and/or authentication tools among other methods to protect certain web-based personal information. E-mails you send us are not necessarily secure when they are transmitted to us. If your communication is sensitive or includes confidential information such as a credit card number, you may want to provide it by post or via the telephone instead. 

We work to protect the security of your credit card information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We do not reveal any of your credit card number when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. 

We instruct our employees with access to your information that it is to be used only in adherence with the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy and the laws applicable to each specific business. Employees who misuse customer information may be subject to disciplinary action.

### WHAT IF WE CHANGE OUR PRIVACY POLICY?

Workopolis reserves the right to modify or supplement this Privacy Policy statement at any time. If we make any material change to this Privacy Policy, we will update this Site to include such changes and post a notice on our home page, for a period of 30 days, with a link to the updated Privacy Policy. Please read any such notice and the new policy statement. If you return to this Site after a period of more than 30 days, please check this Privacy Policy to confirm that you are aware of the details of the most recent update. Please look at the top of this Privacy Policy to check the date that it was updated and to confirm that you are familiar with the terms of the most recent update. Your continued use of this Site after we post such notice will constitute your acceptance of the new terms and their application to your use of this Site and the information disclosed for such use, including information previously furnished us, as if they were the initial terms, and your consent to the use of your personal information as described in this privacy policy and elsewhere at our Website. However, we will seek your consent if we want to use your personal information for purposes other than those you have agreed to previously.

###  CO-HOSTED WEBSITES

Workopolis has partnered with reputable third parties to offer our customers a variety of services. Many of these services also require registration to make them function properly. You can recognize most of these sites if you see both organizations' names on the Web page. For example, if you see a logo on the page that says "Powered by ", you are on a co-hosted site. We also have other third-party relationships, where the third party provides the technology or service under the Workopolis name and Website. In either of these cases, unless otherwise indicated at the registration page, Workopolis does not provide your Registration Information to its third party partners. Although we only work with reputable third parties, our third party partners may have different privacy policies and practices than Workopolis. We encourage you to review our business partners' privacy policies further to understand their procedures for collecting, using and disclosing information.

###  WEBSITE LINKS

This Site may contain links to other sites, including those of our business partners, vendors and advertisers. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, please understand that we are not responsible for the content of, or the privacy practices employed by, other sites.

###  ADDITIONAL PRIVACY PROCEDURES

Privacy procedures specific to certain services from Workopolis can be found on our Site at the location of the particular services. Those procedures are an addendum to this policy, and are provided to you at the place where they will be of most use to you. 

### PRIVACY POLICY WITH RESPECT TO USE OF RESUMES

This policy applies in addition to Workopolis' general Privacy Policy and applies to the use of your resume by Workopolis. As part of the services Workopolis provides, you are able to post your resume on our Website. Resumes are accessed by employers ("Employers") who use your resume for internal job postings and by recruiters ("Recruiters") who seek to find you employment with third parties ("Third Parties"). You will be provided with the choice of either allowing all organizations who search workopolis.com's resume service to access your resume and to contact you, or of limiting access to those organizations to whom you chose to apply for a job. Workopolis restricts Employers from using your resume other than for internal recruiting purposes, and restricts Recruiters from disclosing your resume to Third Parties other than for a specific job posting. Employers and Recruiters are not permitted to disclose information outside their organization or beyond the Third Party, as applicable. Recruiters are also required to have entered into an agreement with Third Parties which requires such Third Parties to use your resume solely for the purpose of filling a job within the Third Party for which the information was provided and not disclosing your Resume outside the organization. However, although Workopolis deals only with reputable organizations, we cannot guarantee that all Employers, Recruiters and Third Parties will adhere to the limitations we impose on them. If at any time you would like your resume removed from our Website, this can be done by using the "delete my resume" function located at www.workopolis\myworkopolis.com. However, Employers and Recruiters who have paid to access the resume database or for whose job posting you may have applied to may have already retained a copy of your resume in their own files and databases. 

Some job postings which are posted on the Workopolis Site allow you to follow links to where you can apply, and provide your resume, for a specific job posting. In some cases, such applications are still within the Workopolis Site and its control, however, if you are not asked to login using your workopolis.com Registration User ID and password, then such application process, and your resume are outside the Workopolis Site and Workopolis' control. In such cases you will be providing your resume directly to the Employer or Recruiter and your resume will be subject to their privacy policy. Workopolis is not responsible for the privacy practices of such Employer or Recruiter. In such cases, we encourage you to review the Employer or Recruiter's privacy policy.

Although we use all reasonable means to protect your personal information, Workopolis is not responsible for any improper use of your personal information that is beyond our reasonable control.

### WE WANT YOUR FEEDBACK

In order to continually monitor and strengthen our privacy procedure, we have on staff Laird Farquharson, a Privacy Manager who can be contacted at [privacy@workopolis.com](mailto:privacy@workopolis.com). Please contact the Privacy Manager if you have questions about privacy and usage that were not answered here. We welcome any suggestions about our Privacy Policy.
