**I. INFORMATION REQUESTED FROM CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE**

Parents: We are a general audience Web site with a children's section. Because we understand that our entire Web site may be appealing to children, we have elected to be fully compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. 

We encourage children and parents to explore our Web site and participate in the interactive activities together. Please remind your children, as we will, that they should check with you before providing any personal information. 

A. WHAT INFORMATION MAY BE COLLECTED

  1. Personally Identifiable Information 

\--We offer free items, such as our Action Kit, for adults or children. To receive such items, we require a name, mailing address and date of birth. If the individual requesting the free item is under the age of 13, that child will be prevented from providing any personally identifiable information. Instead, a pop-up screen will inform the child that we cannot collect his or her information under the **Children's Online Privacy Protection Act** , and will encourage the child to request that a parent or guardian request the free item on their behalf. 

\--We offer a WWF e-Newsletter at the WWF Web site. Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to register to receive the WWF e-Newsletter. When a user subscribes for the e-Newsletter, among other information, WWF will ask whether the user is under 13. If the user is a child under the age of 13, WWF will block that child's ability to subscribe to the e-Newsletter, and the information entered by the child will be discarded. A pop-up screen will direct the child to request that a parent subscribe to the e-Newsletter. 

\--We offer online postcards that children may send via e-mail to their friends. For this, we require the name and email address of a friend, and the name and email address of the sender. We do not retain the child's information beyond what is required to respond to the child's request. Once the online postcard has been delivered to the recipient via email, we discard the identifying information of both the sender and the recipient. 


\--From time to time we may offer online sweepstakes or contests. Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to participate in WWF online sweepstakes and contests. When a user signs up for an online sweepstakes or contest, among other information, WWF will collect the birth date of the user. If the user is a child is under the age of 13, WWF will block that child's ability to enter the sweepstakes or contest, and the information entered by the child will be discarded. 

\--From time to time we may offer online surveys and polls on our Web site. Only anonymous information is gathered, and such information is not linked to identifiable users at the WWF Web site. Information gathered from these surveys and polls will be used for internal purposes only that will help us better tailor our site for the needs of our users. 

\--WWF accepts financial donations through its Web site. In order to make a donation, a Web site visitor must provide his or her name, address and credit card information. We do not knowingly accept credit card information from children under the age of 13, or from individuals who are not the proper cardholder. 

\--WWF links to a Web site dedicated to the Conservation Action Network (CAN). The CAN Web site collects and uses personally identifiable information in connection with grassroots outreach and advocacy efforts. Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to participate in CAN. In order to register with CAN and access the CAN Web site, we require a user to provide a name, mailing address and year of birth. If the user is a child is under the age of 13, WWF will block that child's ability to register with and enter the CAN Web site, and the information entered by the child will be discarded. 

\--The WWF Web site has links to an online store where third-party vendors sell WWF logo goods. Please note that WWF does not process orders or ship merchandise. When a visitor to the WWF Web site clicks on any of the WWF logo goods for sale, the visitor is taken to a Web site operated by the third-party vendor. **Parents please note that WWF does not dictate or supervise the information collection and use policies of these third-party vendors. These third-party vendors may have privacy procedures different from WWF. Please review these third-party vendors' privacy policies for information on how your children's information may be collected.**

  2. Non-Personally Identifiable Information

_Cookies_  
A cookie is a piece of data placed on your hard drive when you visit our site. We may use cookies to help us recognize you when you come back to our site. We may also use cookies to help us monitor traffic on our site. This information may be aggregated in an anonymous manner. This will help us better tailor our site and provide you with offers that we think may be of interest to you. 

_IP Addresses and Environmental Variables_  
WWF may also collect information through IP addresses or environmental variables. An "IP address" is a number used by computers on the network to identify your computer so that data can be transmitted to you. "Environmental variables" include, among other things, the domain from which you access the Internet, the time you accessed our Web site, type of Web browser and operating system or platform used, the Internet address of the Web site you left to visit WWF, the names of the pages you visit while at our Web site, and the Internet address of the Web site you then visit. We collect all of this information to allow us to detect broad demographic trends, to provide information tailored to your interests and to enhance your experience on WWF's Web site. This information may be aggregated in an anonymous manner. 


B. HOW INFORMATION MAY BE USED

**Personally identifying information collected from children under the age of 13 will only be used to send to the child items or information requested by the child in a one-time transaction. This includes sending the child free items or Action Kits, or allowing the child to send to a friend online postcards. Personal information collected to comply with the child's one-time request will be discarded after WWF has complied with the child's request. Non-personally identifying information will be used to help us improve and update our site based on recorded use.**
C. PARENTAL CONTROL OVER COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION

Parents: We do not at this time share personally identifiable information collected by WWF from children under the age of 13 with third parties. However, in the event that our policies change, you will have a choice as to what information about your child, **if any** , is shared. 

Under the **Children's Online Privacy Protection Act** , prior to using personally identifiable information collected from a child under the age of 13, WWF is required to obtain parental consent. Should WWF seek parental consent, parents will receive an email request notifying them in what activity the child has chosen to participate. Requests for parental consent will explain how we collect, use, and disclose children's personal information. Parents will then be given the opportunity (1) to opt out oftheir child's participation in any activity; and (2) to select what information, if any, WWF may share about the child. If a parent opts his or her child out, no information about that child will be retained by WWF. However, the child may be prevented from participating in certain WWF activities that require personal information. 


**II. INFORMATION REQUESTED FROM INDIVIDUALS OVER THE AGE OF 13**

WWF collects two kinds of information from individuals over the age of 13: Personal information that you choose to supply us, and non-personal information, such as your IP address. 

A. WHAT INFORMATION MAY BE COLLECTED

  1. Personally Identifiable Information

WWF may collect and store the information you choose to provide us to send you information about WWF and WWF partners and third parties from time to time. If you make a donation to WWF and elect to pay online, WWF will collect the necessary financial information. **WWF collects and stores some information the user chooses to provide, including name, address and email address, to send users information about WWF and WWF partners and third parties from time to time. WWF will not disclose financial information except as necessary to fulfill users' donation requests. WWF collects such financial information in a secure manner and discards such financial information after processing.**

Survey information will be used for the purposes of monitoring or improving use and satisfaction of the WWF Web site.

In order to register with CAN and access the CAN Web site, we require a user to provide a name, mailing address and year of birth. Participation in the CAN Web site is entirely voluntary.
