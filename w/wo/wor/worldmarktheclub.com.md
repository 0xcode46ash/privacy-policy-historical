Our Sites may also use cookies to keep visitors logged into secure areas as they navigate from page to page. This eliminates the need to log in multiple times during your visit.

##### Use of Internet Protocol ("IP") Addresses

An IP address is a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Internet so that your computer can be identified by the main computers, known as "Web servers," that "serve up" Web pages.

**Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club** and/or its affiliates collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregated Information to our affiliates, and to audit the use of our site. When Customers request pages from **Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club** and/or its affiliates’ sites, our servers log the Customers’ IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a Customer’s session will be logged, but the Customer will remain anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a Customer when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Site terms of use or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers or others.

From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from third parties.

Also, we may keep track of what portions of the Web site Customers are visiting and other Customer statistics, and aggregate this information to help us create a better experience for users of our Web site.

_What happens when you link to a third party site?_

**Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club** are not responsible for the content of any off-site pages or any other Web sites linked to or from the sites. Links appearing on the sites are for convenience only and are not an endorsement by **Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club** or our affiliates or their partners of the referenced content, product, service or supplier. Your linking to or from any off-site pages or other Web sites is at your own risk. **Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club** are in no way responsible for examining or evaluating, and they do not warrant the offerings of, off-site pages or any other Web sites linked to or from the sites, nor do we assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, content, products, or services of such pages and Web sites, including, without limitation, terms and conditions.

_Other:_ We may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating **Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club** terms of use or terms of service, or may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with any **Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club** ’s rights or property, other **Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club** Customers, or anyone else. **Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club** may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.

_Is my information secure from others using the **Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club** sites?_

Sensitive information is protected in its transfer as well as its storage. At appropriate points, the sites use a VeriSign SSL (secure socket layer) security certificate to enable encrypted transfer of data. For example, we use encryption whenever financial information is requested of you. Encryption is the process of scrambling data into an unreadable format that is more secure for transmission over the Internet. Encryption takes your data and uses complex mathematical equations called algorithms to scramble the information into an unreadable format called ciphertext. The ciphertext is impossible to read without having a key to unscramble the information to its original form.

Information is encrypted at the client side (your browser) and then unscrambled or decrypted at the server side ( **Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club** ). The most common levels of encryption are 40-bit, 56-bit and 128-bit and they have been implemented commercially in popular browsers like Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator.

It is your responsibility as a site user to determine the encryption level appropriate for you and to ensure your browser operates at that level. Our sites currently support all three levels of encryption to accommodate the largest number of users. To upgrade your Netscape or Microsoft browser, visit the appropriate web site.

Although we make every effort to help ensure your information is securely transmitted, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. Once we receive your transmission, **Trendwest Resorts, Inc. and WorldMark The Club** uses industry standards efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, restricting access to your computer, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password.
