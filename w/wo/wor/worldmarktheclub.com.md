Additional Uses

Trendwest may also share your personal information with its attorneys, accountants and auditors when necessary to effect, administer or enforce your account, or in the case of the proposed or actual sale, merger, transfer or exchange of all or part of the business or operating unit. 

Your Preferences

Trendwest believes that you should have a choice regarding the disclosure of your personal information we receive when you seek financial services from us. While certain sharing of personal information within the Trendwest family of companies, to affiliates, to service providers and marketing partners, to credit agencies, and in other instances is necessary to conduct business, we provide you with the opportunity to opt out of the sharing of information to nonaffiliated third parties and of the sharing of certain information to affiliates. 

_If you prefer that Trendwest not share your personal information with nonaffiliated third parties, or not share your Consumer Report Information within our affiliated family of companies, you may opt out of those disclosures; that is, you may direct us not to make those disclosures (other than disclosures permitted by law)._ If you wish to opt out of disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties or disclosures of Consumer Report Information within our affiliated family of companies, you may complete the attached form and mail it to us at the address listed.

If someone other than you provided personal information to us in the course of obtaining financing, i.e., as a joint borrower, that person may request a separate notice regarding any changes in their preferences. Joint borrowers may opt out for each other.

Please allow 30 days for any change in your preferences to become effective.

Third-party Web sites may refer to our sites and even provide hyperlinks to specific pages or functions. We are not responsible for the context in which those referring links are made nor are we responsible for ensuring those links work properly. 

NOTE FOR RESIDENTS OF CA: You do not need to complete the Preference Form. Unless you authorize us to do so by contacting us at the address below, Trendwest will not disclose personal information about you outside our corporate group of affiliated companies. You may receive a separate notice regarding additional rights that your state provides. 

Privacy Policy Notice and Updates

Trendwest will provide annual notice to you about our privacy policy as long as you maintain a Customer relationship with us, even if you have elected to opt out. If there are any changes to this policy, which may occasionally occur, Trendwest will provide you with notice of those changes and you will be permitted to change your privacy preferences as long as you remain our Customer. 

Former Customers 

Sensitive information is protected in its transfer as well as its storage. At appropriate points, the sites use a VeriSign SSL (secure socket layer) security certificate to enable encrypted transfer of data. For example, we use encryption whenever financial information is requested of you. Encryption is the process of scrambling data into an unreadable format that is more secure for transmission over the Internet. Encryption takes your data and uses complex mathematical equations called algorithms to scramble the information into an unreadable format called ciphertext. The ciphertext is impossible to read without having a key to unscramble the information to its original form. 

Security of Your Personal Information

An important part of maintaining your financial privacy is the use of security systems and policies. Trendwest maintains electronic, physical and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information. Access to your personal information is limited to those persons who need to know that information. We will evaluate new safeguards when necessary. 

Accuracy of Your Personal Information

Trendwest wants to make sure that we have the most current information on file. We provide you with access to your personal information through periodic statements and online through our Web site, [www.TrendwestResorts.com](http://www.trendwestresorts.com/). If you find that any of your personal information is inaccurate or incomplete, **please advise us via the website listed above or by calling 800-251-8736. PLEASE NOTE THAT REQUESTS TO CHANGE PRIVACY PREFERENCES RELATED TO THIS POLICY MUST BE MADE IN WRITING USING THE FORM ATTACHED BELOW**.
