Is it safe? What are the security risks of downloading the World Community Grid Agent software?  
There are security risks in every application downloaded from the Internet, period. However, we take security very seriously at World Community Grid. We have a comprehensive system of technology and policies to protect you, your computer, and the data running on it. The measures that we use include, but are not limited to, virus scanning all of our build environments, digitally signing information sent to the World Community Grid Agent, encryption both of locally stored files and files sent to the World Community Grid Agent, and biometric access control to the World Community Grid servers. We do everything we can to keep both the World Community Grid Agent and our server systems as secure as possible.  
  
Will my privacy be compromised?  
No. No personally identifiable information is required to run the World Community Grid Agent. You do not need to provide us with any personal information after downloading to run the World Community Grid Agent. However, some location information is required to have your points and cpu time included on some stats pages. Members are told every instance where their e-mail addresses might be used and are given the option to allow or disallow specific e-mail uses. You decide what news and information you wish to receive from us, and you have the ability to view and change these preferences at any time. The World Community Grid Agent itself does not read information beyond its specific directory, except for occasional use of the Windows temporary directory during the processing of Work Units. Beyond this, the only information taken from the computer by the World Community Grid Agent is the system information required to determine the individual computer's contribution (see "How does the World Community Grid Agent determine the information that it gathers from my machine" for more information.) Furthermore, all transactions involving the exchange of this information, whether through the member section of our website or during registration of the World Community Grid Agent, go through secure servers to protect the data. To find out more about Member privacy, review our Member Privacy Policy.  
  
How does the World Community Grid Agent determine the information that it gathers from my machine?  
The World Community Grid Agent determines your processor speed, RAM, and network device by querying the operating system specifically for this information. The storage space displayed is the lesser number between the space allocated in the Device Profile and the actual free space of the drive/partition that the World Community Grid Agent is installed on, determined by specifically querying the operating system for that information.
