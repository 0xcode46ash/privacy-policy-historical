# Privacy Policy :: :: Working Moms Only ®

**WorkingMomsOnly Statement**

WorkingMomsOnly takes individual privacy very seriously. We are also aware of the threats to your security and privacy on the Internet. Please take a few moments to review the steps that WorkingMomsOnly takes to ensure your privacy and security while giving you the best possible customer service as you use our web sites.

**Ordering Online**

Any data you submit to us through an online order form is transferred to us via a Secure Sockets Layer—an encryption protocol—and is kept in databases that cannot be accessed from outside our firewall.

In other words, any data you send us is encrypted, so in the unlikely event a hacker intercepts your data, it cannot be easily read. Our firewall is a mechanism that prevents access to our servers by anyone outside of the company.

WorkingMomsOnly does not sell or rent your name to anyone. That means that only authorized employees of WorkingMomsOnly ever have access to any information you submit. We may use your name and address to send you information on other WorkingMomsOnly products that may suit your interests. And, although we disagree with it, we must turn over any pertinent information to any law enforcement agency that takes the proper steps to require it.

If at any time you wish to be removed from our mailing list, please contact us by [clicking here](https://web.archive.org/contact) or by using the unsubscribe link included in every email we send out.

**E-mail**

If you subscribe to WorkingMomsOnly, your name and e-mail address will be placed in a database. As with all other personal information, only employees of WorkingMomsOnly have access to this data. **We do not give WorkingMomsOnly addresses to outside companies. We will also never rent or sell out email address.**

Any e-mail you send to WorkingMomsOnly is completely confidential. We will not add your name to our e-mail list without your permission. For security reasons, if your inquiry is about one of your subscriptions, we may ask you to submit some additional information only to verify your identity. Remember, in this case we are only asking you to confirm information you have already given us.

**Discussion Board**

You are welcome to participate in the WorkingMomsOnly Discussion Board. Please note that submitting your e-mail address or a URL is completely voluntary—but you do so at your own risk. While WorkingMomsOnly does not harvest e-mail addresses from the Discussion Board, there is nothing to prevent an unscrupulous company from doing so.

You must submit a name to submit a message to the Discussion Board, but it does not have to be your name—aliases are completely acceptable as long as they are unique and not meant to impersonate another person (i.e., "MMF" is not acceptable). If you feel someone is impersonating you on our Discussion Board, please contact us by clicking here and we will take all necessary actions, including legal, to correct the matter.

We reserve the right to remove any messages from the Board which are advertisements to buy or sell securities, are unrelated ads for other products, which contain profanity or are otherwise illegal. But ultimately we cannot be held responsible for any claims made on our Discussion Board.

If you have any questions or comments you can reach us via the [contact page](https://web.archive.org/contact).
