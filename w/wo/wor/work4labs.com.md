## Information Collection

Information You Provide To Us

We collect personal information from you when you provide it to us, such as when you submit

information related to a job posting or post on our blog. Personal information is information that

can be associated with a specific person and could be used to identify that person, but does not

include information anonymized to mask the identity of a specific person. Personal information

may include your name, email address, and other information that identifies you personally

which you elect to provide to us through the Work4 Service.

Our website offers a publicly accessible blog that allows users to post information. You should

be aware that any information you provide through our blog may be read, collected, and used by

others who access the blog.

From time to time, we post customer testimonials/comments/reviews on our websites which may

contain personal information. We obtain the customer’s consent via email prior to posting the

testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.

Information We Collect Automatically

When you use the Work4 Service, we collect certain non-personally identifiable information

from you, which may include but is not limited to your browser type, operating system, IP

address, device type, device ID, Internet service provider, the date and time you access the

Work4 Service, geo-location information, the types of jobs and/or employers you’ve reviewed,

the amount of time you spend using the Work4 Service, the number of times you return to the

Work4 Service and other clickstream information.

We (or service providers used in providing the Work4 Service) may use cookies and web

beacons (also called “pixel tags” or “clear gifs”) to collect non-personally identifiable

information. A cookie is a small text file that may be stored on the hard drive of your device

when you access the Work4 Service. A web beacon is a tiny graphic image that we place on the

Work4 Service, in our emails and in the advertisements we place on other websites.

Our websites include social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button. These features

may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to

enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a

third party or hosted directly on our websites. Your interactions with these features are governed

by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

Currently, we do not respond to “Do Not Track” browser features, but we may do so in the future

as industry standards evolve.

## Information Use

We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes

without your explicit consent. We may use your personal information to contact you, but if you

do not wish to receive communications from us, you can opt out of receiving them through opt-  
out mechanisms included in those communications.

We or service providers working on our behalf may use the information we collect from and

about you for any of the following purposes: (1) to communicate with you regarding your use of

the Work4 Service; (2) to fulfill your requests for information; (3) to respond to your inquiries;

(4) to contact you when necessary; (5) to review Work4 Service usage and operations and

conduct internal marketing and operational research; (6) to address problems with the Work4

Service, our business or our products and services; (7) to protect the security or integrity of the

Work4 Service and our business, including detecting and addressing fraud and abuse; and (8) to

otherwise operate, maintain and provide the features and functionality of the Work4 Service.

Third-party service providers may use cookies and web beacons to deliver Work4 content

and advertising, gather non-personally identifiable data and to perform analytics. We do not

permit any of these service providers to collect any of your personal information through the

Work4 Service. These service providers may use this non-personally identifiable information,

together with anonymous information about you that they receive from others, to deliver targeted

advertisements to you when you are on one or more of the other websites where they deliver

targeted advertisements.

## Information Disclosure

We may share the information we collect from and about you with third parties as described

above, at your direction, and in the following instances:

•    To employers which have posted jobs for which you’ve expressed an interest or

requested additional information;

•    To our parent and subsidiary companies to provide the Work4 Service;

•    As necessary, if we believe that there has been a violation of our terms for the Work4

Service or of our rights or the rights of any third party;

•    As necessary, to identify, investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities or

suspected fraud or other abuse of the Work4 Services;

•    To respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or

in connection with an investigation, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law;

and

•    In the event that Work4 goes through a business transaction, such as a merger,

an acquisition by another company, or a sale of all or a portion of its assets, your

information may be one of the transferred assets.

## Links

The Work4 Service may provide links to third-party websites for your convenience and

information. If you access those links, you will leave the Work4 website. Work4 does not control

those sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from Work4’s. We do not endorse or

make any representations about third-party websites. The personal data you choose to give to

unrelated third parties is not covered by the Work4 Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review

the privacy policy or any company before submitting your personal information. Some third-  
party companies may choose to share their personal data with Work4; that sharing is governed

by that third-party company’s privacy policy.

## Children

We do not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under

13 years of age, and no part of the Work4 Service is directed to persons under 13. If we learn

that personally identifiable information of persons less than 13 years of age has been collected

without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete such

information.

## Security

Work4 takes appropriate steps to ensure data privacy and security through various hardware and

software methodologies. However, we cannot ensure or warrant against all risks with regards to

the security of that information, so information you choose to transmit to Work4 and which we

store is provided to us at your own risk, and Work4 does not guarantee that such information

may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our safeguards. In

addition other Internet sites or services that may be accessible through Work4 have separate data

and privacy practices independent of us, and therefore we disclaim any responsibility or liability

for their security features, policies or actions.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do, we will post the changes on our

website at www.work4labs.com and update the date of this Privacy Policy.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, or if you want to remove any

information you’ve posted in our blog or desire that we delete any testimonial, please contact us

at: privacy@work4labs.com.

If you have any complaints regarding our compliance with the Safe Harbor Frameworks, you must first

contact us at privacy@work4labs.com. Work4 will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and

disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal information.  For complaints that cannot be

resolved between Work4 and the complainant, Work4 will cooperate with JAMS pursuant to the JAMS

International Mediation Rules.
