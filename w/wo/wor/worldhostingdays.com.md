## GENERAL BOOKING TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND PRIVACY POLICY FOR WORLDHOSTINGDAYS EVENTS

##### PREAMBLE

The following Booking Terms and Conditions shall exclusively apply, save as varied by express agreements accepted in writing by both parties. All offers, acceptances or other covenants are solely governed by the conditions expressed herein and any different terms proposed by you are objected to and will not be binding unless assented to in writing by us.

##### BOOKING/BOOKING CONFIRMATION

You can book online, per mail, facsimile, email or by phone. Your booking will only become effective after having been confirmed by us in writing within five working days after submittal. If you have not heard from us within five working days after making your booking, please contact us on +49 2203 / 1045–5900

##### WAITING LISTS

If our conferences are fully booked, we will inform you that we have placed you on a waiting list and will contact you if a space becomes available. We will not process your payment unless your place is confirmed or you have advised us of another date that you wish to attend.

##### PAYMENT

Full payment is required within 15 working days following our booking confirmation via credit card or PayPal. If we do not receive payment within that stated time period we reserve the right to cancel your booking and to refuse your attendance to the conference and (where applicable) clear your bookings for accommodation. Please be informed that we charge a late payment surcharge of 8% above the German Base Rate for all payments made less than two weeks prior to the conference. We retain the right to prove higher damages and consequently allow you to verify that the delay of payment caused no or little damage only. We reserve the right, by giving notice to you at any time before the start of the conference to increase the price of the conference and/or (if applicable) for the accommodation to reflect increases in our costs which are due to effects beyond our control (such as foreign exchange fluctuation, currency regulations, alteration of duties, significant increases in the costs of materials or other costs of services). Payment shall be effective by interbank payment transaction only. Cash payments, cheques or bills of exchange will not be considered as fulfilment of the payment obligation and are sent to us at your own risk.

##### CANCELLATIONS

Please note that in case of cancellations on your side the full conference fee and (where applicable) expenses for travel or accommodation will be forfeited. You are, however, welcome to send a colleague in your place at no additional costs. We retain the right to cancellations for reasons beyond our control such as governmental restrictions, natural disasters, strikes but also technical and/or mechanical problems, in cases of speakers’ incapability or in cases of lack of attendance. In these cases you will receive a reimbursement of your booking payments. Additional costs, in particular travel expenses, will only be reimbursed in cases of gross negligent or intentional action on our side.

##### SET OFF, RIGHT OF RETENTION

You may set off your claims against our receivables once we have accepted your claims in writing or after having obtained a respective court judgement. You may exercise your right to retention insofar, as your claims are based on the same contractual relationship.
