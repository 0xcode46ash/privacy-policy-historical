# WorldGroups: Privacy Policy

|  | 

WorldGroups (hereafter, "GROUPS") is committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of its users. The purpose of this privacy policy is to detail what information we may collect, and how we will use this information. 

**Site Usage Information**

**Groups**

  * GROUPS gathers "site usage" information such as IP address, browser type, access times, and referring URL from all visitors of the GROUPS web site. This data is used in the aggregate to help customize the content and advertising to deliver a better experience to our users. 
  * GROUPS may store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a cookie or similar file and will help us in many ways. For example, cookies allow us to tailor web pages to better match your interests and preferences, and maintain your login session. With most Internet Browsers, you can erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your Browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. 



  
**Individual User Information**

**Disclosure**

  * GROUPS will not generally disclose any personal information to third parties without your consent. GROUPS may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) GROUPS' rights or property, other GROUPS Users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Information may also be disclosed when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
  * We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect our personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. 



**Your Own Responsibilities**

  * Be cautious about disclosing your personal information to others in public forums in GROUPS communications services. GROUPS makes chatrooms, logs, and other public forums to its users. Any information that is voluntarily disclosed by you in these areas becomes public information and GROUPS is not responsible for your disclosures or the consequences of those disclosures. ** Â **

  * By using this site, you signify your assent to the GROUPS Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our sites. Your continued use of GROUPS following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.   

  * We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here or by means of a notice on our home page. If you have questions, please contact via the contact information indicated below.
