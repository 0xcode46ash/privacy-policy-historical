**What Does This Privacy Policy Apply To?**

**What Information Do We Collect?**

Our information collection includes information obtained through our website, mobile applications, social media, other electronic and offline communications. 

Wolfspeed collects information about you in three different ways. The first is when you voluntarily provide information to us.

In certain places on this website, you may be asked to provide your name, contact information and/or email address to use a website feature or communicate with us. Opening an account may require information, for example your name, company, email address, telephone number, mailing address, and credit card numbers. It is your option to provide the information requested. To place an order, we may ask you for financial information such as a credit card number, billing and shipping addresses. 

Wolfspeed may retain records of any messages which you may send to us through this website or other websites owned by Wolfspeed, or by other electronic communications with Wolfspeed.

We may collect information when you provide product reviews, post online questions or submit information to us. We may choose to share your comments through our marketing campaigns and communications. Please see our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-service) for more information regarding submitting information to Wolfspeed.
