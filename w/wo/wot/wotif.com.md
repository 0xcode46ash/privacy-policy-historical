#### Disclosure of your information overseas

Your PII may be transferred to, stored and processed overseas where those third parties with whom we share it, as described in this policy, are located.

We do, however, engage a third party technology platform provider based in the United States to facilitate marketing campaigns controlled and managed by us. 

The recipient of your PII may be located in a country that might not provide an equivalent level of data protection. While we do take steps to help ensure that your PII is protected we cannot be accountable for how these recipients handle your PII. By providing your PII to us you consent to our disclosure of your PII to these parties. If you have any concerns regarding the transfer of your PII overseas please contact us using the details provided below.
