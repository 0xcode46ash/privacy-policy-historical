#### WOW Internet Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy statement (the “Policy”) covers the website at www.wowway.com and the WOW Internet Service (the “Service”) only, and should be read in conjunction with our other Internet service related legal agreements and policies. By using the Service, you expressly consent to the terms of this Policy.

The Policy notifies WOW’s subscribers about: (1) What personally identifiable information is collected about you; (2) How the information is used; (3) With whom the information may be shared; (4) What choices are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of the information; (5) What types of security procedures are in place to protect information under WOW’s control; (6) How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. (7) How you can enforce this Policy and. (8) How long information is retained.

In this Policy, the terms “WOW,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to the operating company subsidiary of WOW! Internet and Cable that owns and/or operates the cable television system in your area pursuant to a cable television franchise with the local franchising authority.  The term “you” refers to you as a subscriber to our Internet service or other service.

 **Information that We Collect About You** WOW collects information from you at several different points on the Service. Some of this information is personally identifiable information, but much of it is not. Personally identifiable information is information that identifies a particular person.

WOW uses its cable system to collect personally identifiable information about our subscribers as necessary in order to render the Service and Service features, to detect unauthorized reception or use of the Service, and as otherwise disclosed in this Policy.

When you establish an account for the Service we collect personally identifiable information about you such as your name, service address, billing address, e-mail address, telephone number, driver’s license number, social security number, bank account number, credit card number, and other similar account information, as well as information used for credit checks, billing, and payment, and other information we may need to establish and service an account.

During the initial provisioning of the Service, and any subsequent changes or updates to that provisioning, WOW collects technical information about your computer hardware and software, cable modem and/or other cable service-related devices, and customization settings and preferences. WOW also collects personally identifiable information about you when you communicate with us for support, maintenance, and billing, send us e-mails, respond to our surveys or e-mails, register for information, or participate in promotions or contests, for example. In addition, WOW may combine personally identifiable information, which we collect as part of our regular business records, with personally identifiable information obtained from third parties for the purpose of creating an enhanced personal database to use in marketing and other activities.

 **How We Use and Disclose the Information** WOW uses personally identifiable information collected on the Service as necessary to render the Service and for legitimate business purposes, including, for example, to: (1) install, operate, support, and maintain the Service; (2) confirm that you are receiving the service requested and are properly billed for it; (3) identify you when changes are made to your Service account; (4) make you aware of new products or services that may be of interest to you; (5) detect unauthorized reception, use, or abuse of the Service; (6) determine whether there are violations of any applicable policies and terms of service; (7) manage, maintain and repair the Service network; (8) configure cable modems and/or other cable service-related devices; (9) bill and invoice you for the Service; (10) conduct surveys; (11) collect fees and charges; (12) market our services and products; (13) implement hardware and software changes and upgrades; (14) prevent fraud; and (15) comply with law.

We sometimes disclose personally identifiable information about you to our affiliates or to others with or without your written consent if necessary to render the Service or to conduct a legitimate business activity related to the Service. For example, we may disclose your name, address, and other personally identifiable information to a third party for technical support. We sometimes also disclose personally identifiable information about you to our employees, contractors, and agents for WOW’s internal business purposes, as well as to outside auditors, professional advisors and service providers, potential business transition partners, regulators, and franchise authorities. Finally, we may disclose your name and address to our affiliates or to others (for example, on a mailing list), but you may prohibit or limit this kind of disclosure by following the instructions in the 

_Choice and Contact Preferences_

section of this Policy. In no case, will the disclosure of your name and address in this manner reveal, directly or indirectly, the extent of any viewing or other use by you of the Service or the nature of any transaction made by you over our cable system.

WOW or our contractors may from time to time share aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information such as the number of Service subscribers who match certain statistical profiles (for example, the number of subscribers in various parts of the country) with our advertisers, content providers, or other third parties with whom we have a relationship. We will not provide our advertisers, content providers, or these other third parties with personally identifiable information about you unless we have received your consent first. Likewise, WOW will not share personally identifiable information about where you go on the Service or on the Web unless we have received your consent first. We also use aggregate information to better understand how the Service is being used, to improve it, and for network management, bandwidth usage, maintenance, performance measurement, and security.

In the event WOW (or its parent company) goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, subscribers’ personally identifiable information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. If, as a result of the business transition this Policy will be changed, you should refer to the 

_Notification of Changes to this Policy_

section. Aggregate information may also be transferred in connection with a business transition.

We will only disclose personally identifiable information to third parties under an obligation of confidentiality and for a limited purpose consistent with this Policy. The frequency of any information disclosure varies in accordance with our business activities and needs.

Although we make every reasonable effort to preserve your privacy as described in this Policy, we will disclose personally identifiable information about you without your consent when required by law in order to comply with a valid legal process such as a subpoena, court order, or search warrant, for example.  Moreover, to the full extent provided by law, we may also use or disclose personally identifiable information about you without your consent to protect our customers, employees, or property, in emergency situations, to enforce our rights in court or elsewhere, or directly with you, and for violations of the Service’s terms of service and policies (including our Acceptable Use Policy).

 **Transmission of Information** WOW transmits personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information about you over the Service when you send and receive e-mail, transfer and share files, make files accessible, visit websites, or otherwise use the Service. Our transmission of this information is necessary to render the Service. WOW may use third parties to deliver some features and functions of the Service, such as support, e-mail, and web hosting, for example, and those third parties may collect or transmit personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information about you. These third parties are not permitted to use your personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing their services.

We will not read your outgoing or incoming e-mail, private chat, or instant messages, but we (or our third party providers) do store e-mail messages on computer systems for a brief period of time. We could be required to disclose these messages and communications along with other personally identifiable information about you to comply with law or to protect our Service as described in the 

_How we Use and Disclose the Information_

section of this Policy. We also monitor the performance of our Service and your Service connection in order to manage, maintain, and improve the Service and your connection to it. We (or our third party providers) use tools to help prevent and block “spam” e-mails, viruses, and other harmful or unwanted communications and programs on the Service. These tools may automatically scan your e-mails, file attachments, and other files and communications in order to help us protect you and the Service against these harmful or unwanted communications and programs. However, these tools do not collect or disclose personally identifiable information about you.

 **Other Service Providers** We sometimes contract with third parties to provide specific services and features for the Service. When you use these particular services, generally you provide your name and specific Service-related information directly to the third party service provider. If you become a customer of these third parties directly, then you will be subject to their terms of service and privacy policies. You should carefully read their terms and policies to understand how they may use personally identifiable information about you.

 **Use of Third Party Ad Networks**

WOW may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on WOW web pages. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer. Doing this allows the ad network to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. WOW does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks.

Ad networks that use persistent cookies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting. You may find more information at the website of either the individual ad network or the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).  


**Preferences**

We store information that you provide to personalize your settings on the Service so that you don’t have to change these settings each time you use the Service. We do not share your preferences with third parties.

 **Cookies** Cookies are small files stored on a computer's hard drive to simplify and improve a user’s Web experience. A website may store information in a cookie about your computer configuration so that it can more efficiently provide information to you the next time you visit the site. Or, your browser program might save a cookie with your username and password so that a website's server will automatically recognize you the next time you access the site.

WOW uses cookies to remember your username and password, if you choose to store them, from the home page of the Service at www.wowway.com. WOW also uses cookies to determine when your current session on the Service's website should be logged out after a period of no activity, as well as for efficient management of the servers providing our website including when you access the Personal Web Pages and Online Storage services. Aside from this information, WOW does not store your name or other personal information in cookies. 

Some of our business relationships are with vendors who may use cookies (for example, search engines) or in connection with their own advertisers and other business partners. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. For more information about how these vendors and their business partners use cookies, and how you may be able to "opt-out" of those cookies, read the privacy policy that applies to each vendor's website. This Policy covers the use of cookies by WOW on the www.wowway.com website only; it does not cover the use of cookies by any other party or website unless stated otherwise. 

**Log Files and Website and E-mail Management** Like many websites, the Service’s website servers use log files. These logs record aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information about site usage such as Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, Internet service providers, referring/exit pages, pages accessed, platform types, date/time stamps, times of use, and numbers of clicks, for example. This information is necessary to analyze trends, administer the Service’s website, balance web traffic, evaluate users’ electronic browsing in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information except as may be required to comply with law and as described in the 

_How we Use and Disclose the   Information_

section.

 **Email Communications from WOW** We send all new subscribers to the Service a welcome e-mail and sometimes other information. Subscribers who would like not to receive information from us about products, services, and special offers, promotions, and features may do so. See the 

_Choice and Contact Preferences_

section of this Policy to learn how to opt out of receiving these types of promotional communications.

We send subscribers Service-related announcements from time to time. For example, we may send you an e-mail announcement about a pricing change or a change in operating policies. You may not opt-out of these Service-related communications, though you can deactivate your Service account if you wish. If you fail to check your Service account and primary e-mail address for Service-related announcements, you may miss important information about the Service, including legal notices, for example.

We communicate with you to provide requested services and support for questions and issues relating to your Service account. We will reply to your requests for customer service by e-mail, phone, discussion forum, or through any other reasonable means.

 **Choice and Contact Preferences** You may choose not to receive marketing communications from us and to limit our disclosure of personally identifiable information we have collected from you. You can also opt to limit our disclosure of your name and address as discussed in the 

_How we Use and Disclose the Information_

section of this Policy.  In order to make this choice, call us at 1-866-4WOW-NOW or write to us at 7887 East Bellewiew Ave., Suite 1000, Englewood, Colorado 80111.  Be sure to include your name, address, account number, and the information that you do not wish to be disclosed.  We may still be required to communicate with you if necessary to render or conduct a legitimate business activity related to the Service, and to disclose personally identifiable information if required to do so by law.

In the event WOW transitions subscribers from another Internet service to the Service, wherever feasible WOW will transition subscribers’ existing preferences and settings to the Service including those pertaining to subscriber choice. Once transitioned to the Service, subscribers can follow the instructions in this Choice and Contact Preferences section of the Policy to change their preferences and settings.

 **Links to Other Websites** The Service’s website contains links to other sites. Some of these other sites may be co-branded with WOW and may look like Service features, but WOW is not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our website and to read the privacy policies of every website that collects personally identifiable information about you , whether the site is co-branded with WOW or not.

 **Security** WOW takes reasonable security precautions to protect our subscribers’ personally identifiable information that we collect on the Service from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. For example, we store billing records on computers in a controlled and secure environment. However, WOW cannot guarantee that our security precautions will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose your personally identifiable information.

 **Correcting and Accessing Information** If your personally identifiable information changes, if you wish to confirm the accuracy of your personally identifiable information, or if you no longer want to subscribe to the Service, we provide a way to correct that information and a way to deactivate a Service account. You can correct some personally identifiable information at our website, www.wowway.com. Or, contact us by telephone at the contact information listed below to correct information or deactivate your Service account. In addition, you may examine and copy (at your cost) any personally identifiable information we collect and maintain relating to you at your local WOW office upon reasonable notice and during regular business hours. If you wish to inspect those records, please contact us by telephone at 1-866-4WOW-NOW, giving us a reasonable period of time to locate and, if necessary, prepare the information for review, and to arrange an appointment during regular business hours. We will correct our records if you make a reasonable showing that any of the personally identifiable information we have collected about you is inaccurate. You will only be permitted to examine records that contain information about you and no one else.

 **Enforcement** You, as a subscriber to the Service, may enforce the limitations imposed on WOW by applicable federal law with respect to the collection and disclosure of personally identifiable information about you, through a civil action under federal law, in addition to other rights and remedies that may be available to you under federal or other applicable laws.

 **Retention of Information** We will maintain most, if not all, of the personally identifiable information we have collected during the time you are a subscriber to the Service. We generally will destroy this personally identifiable information after a reasonable period of time has elapsed following the termination of your Service account with us, if the purpose for which the information was collected has been accomplished and we no longer need to retain the information for legitimate business activities or compliance with law.

 **Notification of Changes to this Policy** If we decide to change this Policy, we will post those changes on our website, or in other places we deem appropriate, so our subscribers are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected. Your decision to continue receiving the Service after we make any changes to this Policy shall be deemed to be your express consent to the changes in the revised Policy.

 **WOW Cable and Telephone Customers** If you are a WOW cable video or telephone customer, the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information regarding cable video service is described in the WOW Cable Privacy Policy and the WOW Telephone Privacy Policy.

 **Contact Information** If you have any questions or suggestions regarding this Policy, or wish to contact us about your personal information, please contact us at:

Phone: 1-866-4WOW-NOW

 **Special Note about Children** Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, WOW will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen without first obtaining parental consent. Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else.
