  2. Don’t forget that email and other electronic communications are not secure if they haven’t been encrypted.

It is your responsibility to review the third party’s terms and conditions / privacy policy and otherwise satisfy yourself that you are happy to provide your information to that third party. The same applies if you otherwise supply information on third party websites to which we may link.  We are not responsible for the use of your data by such third parties.
