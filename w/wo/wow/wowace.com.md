# Privacy Policy | Curse

(Last Updated on February 7, 2008) 

  
Curse Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "Curse Inc." or "we") considers the protection of personal privacy to be one of our most important values. This privacy policy ("Policy") gives you specific information on how we protect your privacy, how we treat personal information, and the choices you have. This privacy policy complies with the Safe Harbor framework under the E.U. Data Protection Directive. In addition, Curse Inc. self-certifies compliance with the Safe Harbor framework to the U.S. Department of Commerce. 

This Policy applies to all web sites and services owned or provided by Curse Inc. and its subsidiaries, which we refer to here collectively as "Curse Inc. Sites". Curse Inc. Sites include, but are not limited to, Curse.com, as well as other Curse Inc.-branded services. From time to time we may add new sites, domain names or services to those listed above. Please note that this Policy applies only to sites owned and services maintained by Curse Inc. or its corporate subsidiaries and not to web sites or services provided by other companies or organizations to which we link. 

As a condition of using the Curse Inc. Sites, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy. Additional terms and conditions which govern your use of the Curse Inc. Sites are contained in our User Agreement, and, as applicable, in certain other service-specific license agreements or terms of use, which you will be notified of at the time of your registration for the applicable services. 

The Policy is accessible through the Curse Inc. Sites in several ways, including from a link entitled "Privacy" at the bottom of the Curse.com home page. You acknowledge that this Policy may change over time. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to revise this Policy at any time. If we decide to change our Policy, we will post the revised policy on the Curse Inc. Sites. Any changes are effective immediately upon posting to the Curse Sites. As we may make changes at any time without notifying you, we suggest that you periodically consult this Policy. Please note that our rights to use your personally identifiable information will be based on the privacy policy in effect at the time the information is collected. Your continued use of the Curse Inc. Sites constitutes your agreement to all such terms and conditions of the Policy. 

Information Collection, Storage and Use 

We refer to information that identifies an individual as "Personal Information." In general, Curse Inc. collects Personal Information from users of the Curse Inc. Sites in connection with access to certain online areas or services, including during (i) registration for certain online community services and tools such as message boards, chat rooms or other community services; (ii) registration for special communications, such as email updates and newsletters; (iii) subscription registration; (iv) user surveys; (v) events, sweepstakes, contests or promotions; and (vi) registration for online multi- or single-player gaming, either through the Curse Inc. Sites, within a game publisher's site or through the game itself. Your Personal Information is stored on Curse Inc. computer servers (or those of its service providers) located in the United States. 

We may gather navigational, click stream data that indicates the areas of the Curse Inc. Sites you visit or access. This navigational data does not identify you as an individual user (i.e., based on your PII). We may enter into agreements with outside companies that possess the technology that allows Curse Inc. to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on the Curse Inc. Sites. Your non-PII and click stream data about your activities on the Curse Inc. Sites may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished. These companies have agreed not to share your information with any third party or use it for any other purpose. Anonymous click stream and demographic information may also be shared with Curse Inc.'s advertisers and business partners. We also use and share navigational data in aggregate, non-personal form to understand how our users as a group use the Curse Inc. Sites. 

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information in public areas of a Curse Inc. Site, such as the member home pages and message boards, your information can be viewed and possibly used by others. We advise users to be especially careful in such public areas about disclosing Personal Information, such as full name, home address, or phone number. 

Below are more details about the Personal Information we, or third parties may gather from you and how we may use it. 

A. Email Newsletters. Curse Inc. offers email newsletters to its registered users. We will use your email address to send you only the specific newsletter(s) that you signed up for. If you want to update your email address or stop receiving a newsletter, follow the procedures to unsubscribe at the bottom of any newsletter we send you or simply visit http://my.curse.com/account/. 

B. Membership Information. When you register for membership on a Curse Inc. Site, we will ask you for certain minimum required information, such as your name, birth date, gender, email address and zip code. We may also ask for additional information about you and your interests. We do this so we can better understand your preferences and tailor the Curse Inc. Sites to suit you better. The more information you volunteer, the more we can tailor the Curse Inc. Site and promotions to your interests. Additionally, third-party service providers may require you to assent to their privacy party as a condition to receiving their service. 

  * Service Providers. We offer our members other services provided by third parties such as email and userpages, among others. When you register for membership on a Curse Inc. Site or activate a related service by clicking on a particular service link (i.e. email) on an Curse Inc. Site, you may be automatically registered to receive the services we offer and some of your Personal Information may be transferred from Curse Inc. to those third-party service providers. By becoming a member, you authorize us and our third-party service providers to send you email updates and information about promotions and special offers. We take care to require that our third-party service providers only use our member's data as necessary to provide the particular service and to give you updates on that service provider's products and services. 


  * Game Owners/Publishers. We provide game owners/publishers with certain hosted technology and software that enables various game related functionalities, such as online multi- or single-player gaming. If you are not already a registered user of the Curse Inc. Sites you may be asked to provide Personal Information in connection with your use of such services. We share Personal Information with game owners/publishers that offer such services to enable those entities to operate the services you have elected to receive. Game owners/publishers may also use Personal Information for other business purposes, provided that such use shall be in compliance with the terms of this Policy, except that a game owner/publisher (a) will not contact you or otherwise use or transfer your Personal Information, unless you have expressly consented. Upon giving such consent your Personal Information will be subject to the game owner's/publisher's privacy policy. 


  * Co-registration with Other Sites. As a member, we offer you the ability to co-register with select third-party partner sites. In some instances where Curse Inc. provides co-registration, the co-registration partners allow you to opt-out of their membership. If you choose to co-register with our partners and accept their terms of service, then you are automatically registered as a member of their select web sites and your Personal Information is transferred to those organizations. As a result, you may receive information from one of these web sites as any of their members would. We advise you to review the privacy and data collection policies of the third-party partner sites for further information. In order to cancel your membership with any of these partners you will need to go directly to the partner's site. 


  * Advertisers. Curse Inc. may send you emails on behalf of our advertisers. If you opt to receive information from our advertisers they may use your Personal Information to send you advertisements or other notices, via email or postal mail, and it is possible that your information may be shared with others. 


  * Other Parties. We occasionally provide third parties with Personal Information limited only to your physical address in order to send you promotional mailings. 



C. Email Updates to Members. If you so elect at registration, we may periodically send you promotional email about products or services offered by the Curse Inc. Sites, our partners and advertisers. If you want to update your email address or stop receiving these types of promotional emails, please follow the procedures to unsubscribe at the bottom of any email we send you or simply visit http://my.curse.com/account/ to update your profile.

D. Promotions. We may ask you for Personal Information at other times, including, but not limited to, when you enter sweepstakes, contests or promotions sponsored by Curse Inc. or a third party. If you choose to enter sweepstakes, contests or promotions sponsored by a third party, the Personal Information you provide will be subject to the privacy policy of the third party sponsor. We encourage you to check the applicable third party policy before providing any Personal Information. 

E. Surveys and User Research. Curse Inc. conducts email and web-delivered surveys from time to time, as well as instant polls, to gather information about our users. Taking these surveys and polls is entirely optional. You have no obligation to respond to them. We share only the aggregate results of these surveys, not Personal Information, with our advertisers and partners to help them better understand our services and monitor the reach of their advertising or other offerings on our service. We also use some of the Personal Information that you provide in these surveys to help us understand your interests and to make the Curse Inc. Sites more useful to you. 

F. Use of Cookies. On the Internet, a "cookie" is a piece of information (a file) that a Web site transfers to a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. The use of cookies is common on the Internet. The process we use to serve advertisements and to track use of the Curse Inc. Sites involves cookies. We use cookies to recognize users who have already registered for a Curse Inc. Site, allowing those users to speed up their future activities on the Curse Inc. Sites. Cookies help Curse Inc. and our advertising service (discussed below) track the frequency and placement of advertisements. Cookies also enable us to measure aggregate (total) usage and traffic to the Curse Inc. Sites and to specific offerings. This aids us in producing content that best meets our users' preferences. In order to implement new services, we may use other types of cookies as well. We also may use cookies to understand better what parts of the Curse Inc. Sites you like best. We may use that information to display advertisements that we think will be of particular interest to you. You may configure your browser to reject cookies, but this may interfere with some functionality of the Curse Inc. Sites. To find out more about changing your browser to reject cookies, we suggest the EPIC Cookies Page http://www.epic.org/privacy/internet/cookies. Certain pages of the Curse Inc. Sites may contain electronic images (called a "single-pixel GIF" or "web beacon") that allow a web site to count users who have visited that page. Curse Inc. occasionally uses web beacons on the Curse Inc. Sites in order to count users and to recognize registered users by accessing the Curse Inc. cookies.

H. Software Updates; Interactive Material. Curse Inc. automatically updates software used in conjunction with certain of the services available on the Curse Inc. Sites. In order to update this software, Curse Inc. collects a user's current version information from the user's computer. This information is not archived and is only used to determine which software requires updating. Curse Inc. may record audio conversations or copy text chat or video images from chat rooms on the Curse Inc. Sites and may disclose such material for use in connection with promoting the Curse Inc. Sites.

J. Sharing Non-Personal Information. Curse Inc. may share information that is not Personal Information -- meaning non-personal, aggregate, or summary, information regarding our users -- with other third parties not mentioned in this Policy. This kind of information does not identify you individually. 

K. Future Business Transactions. As we continue to develop our business, we might sell certain of our assets. In such transactions, user information, including personally identifiable information, Personal Information, generally is one of the transferred business assets.

L. Legal Authorities. We may also disclose Personal Information in cases when we reasonably believe that it is necessary to identify someone who may be violating Curse Inc. policies or Curse Inc.
