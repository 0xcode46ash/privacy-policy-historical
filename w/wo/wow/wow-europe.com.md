# Blizzard Entertainment - On-Line Privacy Policy

**Blizzard Privacy Policy**

(Last update: August 9, 2004)

Vivendi Universal Games International, the parent company and its subsidiary companies, operating under the business name Blizzard (referred to herein as "Blizzard"), as the authorized distributor for Blizzard Entertainment’s copyrighted computer software product “World of Warcraft” in the European Union, respects the confidentiality of its on-line visitors and recognises the importance of providing a secure environment. It is therefore important to make available to on-line visitors an explanatory document outlining how their personal details are collected, processed and utilised (hereafter the "Privacy Policy"). This Privacy Policy explains the ways in which Blizzard safeguards the confidentiality of its on-line visitors. Please note that the Blizzard Privacy Policy does not apply when you access other sites via the web links located on Blizzard internet sites, as we have no control over the activities of these other sites.

[**http://www.blizzard.fr**](http://www.blizzard.fr/)  
[**http://www.blizzard.de**](http://www.blizzard.de/)  
[**http://www.worldofwarcraft-europe.com**](http://www.worldofwarcraft-europe.com/)

Blizzard also has other domain names which link to the Internet sites listed above. Furthermore, we may add Internet sites which may not be listed, but which provide a link to this Privacy Policy and respect the terms within it. 

**What personal information can we collect?**  
Blizzard only collects personal information with your consent. An on-line visitor generally submits data to Blizzard for the following reasons: (1) to purchase goods and services from our on-line stores; (2) for registration for products or to participate in network games; (3) to access personalised services for players; (4) to register a warranty; (5) to enter a competition; (6) to register a complaint; and/or (7) a site visit. The personal data compiled could include your name, your street address, your telephone number, your email address, your age and/or your date of birth. We do not require this information if you are just visiting our sites, but you may be unable to access certain areas of the sites without registering, or receive any elements such as our information bulletins without providing a certain amount of personal information.

Any visitors purchasing products or services at our on-line stores will have to submit additional information, usually a valid credit card number and card expiry date. 

**What other information can we collect?**  
Your web browser or your client software may forward to Blizzard geographical information or data concerning your computer's capabilities. Blizzard may use this data to produce global statistics on its clients. This information would never be linked to you personally or to your home. 

**What are cookies and how do we use them?**  
Cookies are small data files sent to your hard disk from the Internet sites you visit. Any cookies stored on your computer could be used to recall details such as your password or a previous registration.

Blizzard may use cookies on its Internet sites. This allows us to speed up your future activities by reducing the length of time you would otherwise spend typing your password or your registration details. Cookies can also be used to identify the user for commercial or publicity purposes. 

Most web browsers enable you to block cookies or to receive a warning message before any cookies are saved onto your PC. If you would prefer not to have any cookies installed on your hard drive, we recommend that you consult your browser manual or the help window for more information. Cookies may, however, be necessary for running certain applications on our sites and blocking them could result in your being unable to access certain applications. 

**What are IP (Internet Protocol) addresses?**  
An IP address is the number assigned to your server or your computer by your Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). Blizzard may require these IP addresses for system administration purposes or for sending out information collectively. Blizzard may also use IP addresses to limit the use of our servers by any other system to avoid any misuse of the aforementioned servers. 

We do not attach these IP addresses to any information of a personal nature which may concern you; this means that your visits to our Internet sites are registered, but remain anonymous. 

We may sometimes use these IP addresses in conjunction with your ISP if we feel that the conditions of use have been violated or at the request of the legal authorities. 

**Who collects your information?**  
When you visit a Blizzard site and you are asked to provide information, you only share this information with Blizzard except where clearly indicated to the contrary. Some services are, however, provided in conjunction with partner companies. If a company other than Blizzard receives your personal data, you will be notified the moment this operation takes place. In any case, the transfer of personal data to another company should only be carried out with your express authorisation. 

Please bear in mind that message boards and Internet sites linked to our sites could obtain some of your personal information. We would remind you that Blizzard's Privacy Policy does not apply to these message boards or to these other sites, as we have no control over their activities. 

**How do forms work?**  
When you fill in a form (order form, subscription to information bulletins, questionnaire, etc.), certain fields must be completed. These obligatory fields are marked with an asterisk. These obligatory fields are required by Blizzard to allow you access to services or for invoicing purposes should you place an order or subscribe to a paid service. 

You could be asked to enter a user name and a password. We would ask that you do not use your real name, the name of another person or a name protected by copyright or a trademark as a user name. 

In any case, the information you enter in the forms is only sent to Blizzard once you have clicked the "Send" or the "OK" button. 

You can halt the transfer of data at any time by quitting the form screen, i.e. by closing your web browser; no information will then be sent to Blizzard. 

**How could your personal information be used?**  
The personal data you submit to Blizzard allows us to process your orders and, if you wish, to inform you of our new products, updates and/or competitions, promotional offers and special events. 

With your consent, we can also send your personal information to other companies or organisations who offer products which may be of interest to you. 

Finally, we can use your personal data to generate internal statistics for marketing, consumer profiles or demographic research, etc. to tailor our products and services to satisfy your requirements. Our aim is to better understand and serve our clients. 

**With whom might we share your information?**  
As a general rule, Blizzard would not forward your information to a third party without your permission. However, we may divulge this data to third party vendors in response to a product order to add you to their commercial bulletin circulation list. In some cases, we can also disclose this information if our Licence Agreements have been violated or if, in all good faith, we judge it is legally justified. 

**What are your rights concerning the collection, use and distribution of your personal data?**  
Blizzard allows you to monitor the way in which we use the personal information we obtain. Any promotional materials which Blizzard may send to you (e.g. "newsletters" or "information bulletins") contain internal mechanisms that allow us to block their forwarding. 

You can also contact us if you wish to change the way in which we use your personal information, i.e. whether Blizzard, the parent company or any subsidiary company can send you e-mails or standard mail regarding our products or services.

You can contact us at the following address: Blizzard, 32, avenue de l'Europe, 78143 Vélizy, France. You can also reach us by telephone on +33 (1) 30 67 90 00 or by e-mail at: [webmaster-en@blizzard.com](mailto:webmaster-en@blizzard.com). Please state which services or publications you no longer wish to receive so that we can respond to your needs more effectively. 

**What should you do if you wish to amend or review your personal information?**  
If, for any reason, you are concerned about the way in which we collect your personal information, if you wish to access, amend or correct it, or if you want us to delete it from our servers, please contact Blizzard, 32, avenue de l'Europe, 78143 Vélizy, France. You can also contact us by telephone on +33 (1) 30 67 90 00 or by e-mail at: [webmaster-en@blizzard.com](mailto:webmaster-en@blizzard.com). 

**What should you do if you have any questions or complaints?**  
If you have any questions or complaints, please send us an e-mail at the following address: [webmaster-en@blizzard.com](mailto:webmaster-en@blizzard.com) or write a letter to: Blizzard, 32, avenue de l'Europe, 78143 Vélizy, France. 

**What level of security is applied to your personal information?**  
Blizzard deems it a point of honour that the information you send us should be protected and should remain in its original form, i.e. unaltered. In this respect, access to all private data is very strictly monitored. Furthermore, we will do our utmost to ensure that the third parties to whom we may forward this information provide sufficient guaranties of security with regard to this personal information. 

**Note to parents:**  
We feel under a particular obligation to protect information obtained from young children. We would strongly urge parents to teach their children never to disclose their real name, their address or their telephone number while they are on-line without prior permission. No information should be transmitted to Blizzard by minors aged 12 years or under. Blizzard commits to never knowingly processing data provided by minors aged 12 years or under. 

Adolescents aged 13-17 years should ask their parents to read our Privacy Policy and to contact us if they would like any information on our guarantee of confidentiality or to comment on the content. 

Minors under 18 years of age should not order or subscribe to any paid service on-line without the permission of their parents or guardians. We would ask parents and guardians to be particularly vigilant and to ensure that their minors do not transgress when using our sites or on-line services. 

Visiting the Blizzard Internet sites and using our on-line services indicates your acceptance of Blizzard's Privacy Policy. If you do not accept this Privacy Policy, please do not visit our Internet sites or use our on-line services.
