# WOWtv Website Privacy Policy

Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal information that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose. 

Through customer surveys, subscriptions and newsletter registration, our site may request users to provide personal contact information (such as name, locale, email and telephone). The demographic information is used, among other things to enhance user experience so we can be more content specific. The contact information is used to notify users of new services and content, as well as for surveys and newsletters. 

Our sites use an order form for customers to subscribe to our paid services. We collect contact information and financial information (like credit card numbers). Contact information is used for billing purposes, as well as to contact the subscribers when necessary. We do not share personal financial information with any other parties.

We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the site. We use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from, which URL you go to next, your computer browser information and your IP address. Your IP address is used to help diagnose problems with your server and to administer our website and services. 

We may run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (such as their name and email address) and demographic information (such as their zip code, age, and/or income level). The user's contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary, such as if they win a contest or to notify users of upcoming contests. There are three primary types of contests: 

1\. We host solely and all information collected is kept within the company. 

2\. We may share address information with third party for shipping purposes. 

3\. In some rare instances, a third party may host the contest and all information is then shared. 

In our contest registration, we give our users the opportunity to sign up for the Company newsletter. However, users may opt-out of receiving future mailings by selecting the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the newsletter. The Company products and services are directed at an adult market, and therefore this site is intended for use by adults only. The Company encourages parents to take an active role in their children's use of the internet, and to inform them of the dangers of providing information about themselves over the internet. Children of any age should always ask a parent or guardian for permission before sending personal information to anyone online. No information should be submitted to or posted on this web site by users under 18 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. Children are not eligible to use our services and we ask that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us. If you are a minor, you can use this service only in conjunction with your parents or guardians. 

Advertisements appearing on this web site are delivered to you either by (a) one of our web advertising partners or (b) by us. Information about your visit to this site, such as the number of times you have viewed an advertisement, your browser type (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer), the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for instance) and whether or not you responded to the advertisement delivered, (but not your name, address, phone number or other personal information), is used to serve advertisements to you on this site. 

We may use your zip code or geographical location information to serve advertisements to this site. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. We aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) personally identifiable information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for other marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally. Certain information, such as your name, email address, password, credit card number, and bank account number, are never disclosed to marketing advertisers.
