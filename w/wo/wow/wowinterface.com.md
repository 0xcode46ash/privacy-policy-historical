This is OGaming's entire and exclusive Privacy Policy and it supersedes any earlier version. The OGaming Store reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy in accordance with the terms herein at any time, which is why OGaming encourages you to visit this page often, review this Privacy Policy frequently, and remain informed about any changes to it. 

If, after review, you still have questions about any portion of this Privacy Policy, please contact OGaming using the contact information provided at the bottom of this Privacy Policy. 

### Information Collection and Use 

**Personal Information**

“Personal Information” means information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, or other contact information, whether at work or at home. 

On all OGaming Web sites that collect Personal Information, we specifically describe what information is required in order to provide you with the product, service, or feature you have requested. 

OGaming collects Personal Information when you contact OGaming, when you register with the OGaming Network, when you use OGaming products and services, when you submit an order with the OGaming Store to purchase products offered for sale, when you visit the OGaming Web sites or the Web sites of certain OGaming partners, and when you enter promotions and sweepstakes. 

_Registration_

You are required to register with OGaming in order to use selected features of the OGaming Network, such as being able to posting messages on OGaming forums. In order to register, you must first complete the on-line registration form, which requires you to create a username and password. During registration, you are also required to provide Personal Information, such as your e-mail address and birth date, so that we may contact you about the services on the site(s) in which you have expressed interest and so that we may verify your age. 

During registration, you will also have the option to provide additional Personal Information, such as your homepage, your instant messenger handle(s) and additional e-mail addresses. OGaming will make this information viewable by other users of the OGaming Network to facilitate interaction between you and other users of the OGaming Network. 

_The OGaming Store_

The OGaming Store only collects Personal Information from you on a voluntary basis and only that information necessary to facilitate the completion of an order. Personal Information collected is not limited to, but may include: name, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number, and credit Card expiration date. 

_Promotions, Contests and Sweepstakes_

From time-to-time, OGaming may provide you the opportunity to participate in promotions, contests or sweepstakes on the OGaming Web site(s). Such promotions, contests and sweepstakes will also be governed by the rules and regulations posted with such promotions, contests and sweepstakes. If you participate, you will be required to register with OGaming, which will require you to provide certain Personal Information. Participation in these promotions, contests and sweepstakes is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to register and provide your Personal Information. The requested information typically includes contact information, such as name, shipping address, e-mail address, and telephone number. OGaming will use this information to notify winners and award prizes. Additionally, during your registration process you may opt-in to receiving additional related communications from OGaming. If you decide to opt-in, OGaming will use the information provided to send you communications described throughout this Privacy Policy. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications (please see the "Choice and Opt-Out" section of this Privacy Policy) if at any time you decide you do not wish to receive such communications. 

_Newsletters_

If you wish to subscribe to the OGaming newsletter(s), OGaming will use your name and e-mail address to send the newsletters to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications (please see the "Choice and Opt-Out" section of this Privacy Policy). 

**Other Information Collected**

Some information may be collected automatically every time you visit the OGaming Web sites, such as cookies and computer information. In addition, information may be collected from other independent, third-party sources. OGaming also collects information about which pages you visit within OGaming. This site visitation data is identified only by a unique URL. 

_Cookies_

OGaming uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies as part of its interaction with your browser. A cookie is an alphanumeric identifier (a file) that OGaming Web sites transfer to your computer’s hard drive through a Web browser to enable its systems to recognize your browser for record-keeping purposes. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser, while a persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. 

OGaming uses session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the OGaming Web sites. OGaming uses persistent cookies to identify and track which sections of its Web site you most often visit. OGaming also uses persistent cookies in areas of its Web site where you must register, and where you are able to customize the information you see, so that you don't have to enter your preferences more than once. OGaming cookies do not collect Personal Information and OGaming does not combine information collected through cookies with other Personal Information collected to determine your identity or a your e-mail address. 

By configuring the options in your browser, you may control how cookies are processed by your system. However, if you decline the use of cookies you may not be able to use certain features on OGaming Web sites and you may be required to reenter the information required to complete an order during new or interrupted browser sessions _._

Some of OGaming's business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on the OGaming Web sites. OGaming has no access to or control over these cookies (see "Third Party Advertising" and "Third Party Cookies" below). Accordingly, this Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by OGaming only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. 

OGAMING DOES NOT DISCLOSE ITS COOKIES TO THIRD PARTIES EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY A VALID LEGAL PROCESS SUCH AS: SEARCH WARRANT, SUBPOENA, JURISDICTIONAL STATUTE, OR COURT ORDER. 

_Log Files_

As is true of most Web sites, OGaming gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet services provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. OGaming uses this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the OGaming Web sites, to track users' movements around the Web sites and to gather demographic information about OGaming's user base as a whole. OGaming does not combine information collected through log files with other Personal Information collected to determine your identity or your e-mail address. 

_Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)_

OGaming employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help OGaming better manage content on its Web sites by informing OGaming what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. OGaming does not combine information collected through clear gifs with other Personal Information collected to determine your identity or your e-mail address. 

OGaming uses clear gifs in its HTML-based e-mails to inform OGaming which e-mails have been opened by you. This allows OGaming to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of OGaming's marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these e-mails, please see "Choice and Opt-Out" section of this Privacy Policy. 

_Information from Third Party Sources_

To improve services and enhance personalization, OGaming may periodically obtain information about you from other independent third party sources and add it to our account information. For example, when you visit a site on which OGaming advertises, and click through such advertisement, OGaming may place cookies on your computer. 

_Third Party Advertising_

The ads appearing on the OGaming Web sites are delivered to you by DoubleClick, OGaming's Web advertising partner. Information about your visits to the sites, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address or other Personal Information), is used to serve ads to you.

In the course of serving advertisements to the OGaming sites, OGaming third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your web browser.
