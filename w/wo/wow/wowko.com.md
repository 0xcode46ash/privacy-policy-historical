This code is uniquely yours and allows you to navigate the Site without having to fill out registration forms with information you have already provided as long as you are using the same computer from which you initially supplied the information. Two other cookies are also written to your hard disk at various times you are navigating our Site that allow us to remember what is in your on-line shopping cart and provide you with the proper pricing for your location. Additionally, if you are interrupted before finalizing an on-line purchase, your order contents will be preserved for up to two weeks. Your credit card number is not retained in our database.

We do not engage in list selling or "cookie swapping" with other companies.
