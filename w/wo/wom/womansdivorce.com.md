# Privacy Policy

At WomansDivorce.com, we take your privacy seriously, and are dedicated to protecting our customers', consumers' and online visitors' privacy on our website.  This document outlines the types of personal information we receive and collect when you use this website, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard information.

**How information is collected and how it's used:**

  * When a visitor comes to our website, our web server recognizes only your IP address, not your e-mail address, allowing you to remain anonymous.  We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. The information collected is used solely for internal review and not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes.



**Cookies**

  * Cookies are pieces of data that your web browser stores on your hard drive, identifying you as a unique visitor.  This helps us to improve the content of our site, based on the individual pages visited during a viewing session.  We also track which websites refer visitors to our site.

This information is collected when you request information from us, participate in a contest or sweepstakes, sign up to join our email list, or request some other service or information from us.  This website also makes use of surveys to gather general information about its viewer base.

**Release of Information**

  * If WomansDivorce.com is sold, the information we have obtained from you through your voluntary participation in our site may transfer to the new owner as a part of the sale in order that the service being provided to you may continue. In that event, you will receive notice through our website of that change in control and practices, and we will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the purchaser honors any opt-out requests you might make of us.
