If you are not at least 18 years old you may not use the Site without adult supervision. You warrant that you are at least 18 years old or have obtained parental permission to use this Site. The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to provide you with MYGORGEOUSCENTS's information collection practices (including the information MYGORGEOUSCENTS collects, how it is collected, and the circumstances under which the information is disclosed), and to demonstrate MYGORGEOUSCENTS' firm commitment to privacy and adherence to the California Online Privacy Protection Act.

**2\. SECURE SITE**  
Our site uses an online secure order form. When a User's order is placed through our secure online server, or a User sends MYGORGEOUSCENTS an email, MYGORGEOUSCENTS collects confidential customer information. When a User sends an email (as distinguished from a secure order form, which is encrypted), it is not necessarily secure and is not encrypted. Information collected from affiliates and newsletter subscribers may not be encrypted or maintained on a secured site. All of the customer data MYGORGEOUSCENTS collects is protected against unauthorized access.

**3\. INFORMATION COLLECTION& USE**   
MYGORGEOUSCENTS is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. MYGORGEOUSCENTS will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. MYGORGEOUSCENTS collects information from our users at several different points on our website.   
**Return to Index.**

  


**4\. ORDER**  
MYGORGEOUSCENTS requests information from the User on an order form. The information that is collected to process the order may include contact information (name, shipping address, telephone number, fax number and/or email address) and financial information (credit card number, name on account, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customers' orders. This contact information is used to contact the User.

**5\. COOKIES**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the User. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the User closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the User would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the User will be limited in some areas of the MYGORGEOUSCENTS site. For example, the user will not be able to participate in any of our Sweepstakes, Contests or monthly Drawings that take place. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, MYGORGEOUSCENTS has no access to or control over business partners' cookies.

**Return to Index.**

  


**7\. SHARING**   
MYGORGEOUSCENTS may share aggregated demographic information with MYGORGEOUSCENTS' partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. MYGORGEOUSCENTS may use several credit card processing companies and banks to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. MYGORGEOUSCENTS may partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, MYGORGEOUSCENTS may share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. MYGORGEOUSCENTS may release account information when MYGORGEOUSCENTS believes, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to comply with law, prevent fraud, enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or to otherwise protect the rights, property and safety of MYGORGEOUSCENTS, our customers or other third parties.

**8\. LINKS**  
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that MYGORGEOUSCENTS is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. MYGORGEOUSCENTS encourages its Users to be aware when they leave the MYGORGEOUSCENTS site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. This Site may include links to other Internet sites, both related and unrelated to the Site, which may be of interest to users. MYGORGEOUSCENTS may not have reviewed these sites and is not responsible for the content or availability of these sites. Descriptions of or references to products or publications not owned by MYGORGEOUSCENTS on this Site or any linked site do not imply any endorsement of such products or publications by MYGORGEOUSCENTS.

**Return to Index.**

  


**10\. SURVEYS& CONTESTS **  
From time-to-time MYGORGEOUSCENTS requests information from Users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the User therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.

Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

**11\. TELL-A-FRIEND**   
If a User elects to use the MYGORGEOUSCENTS referral service for informing a friend about our site, MYGORGEOUSCENTS asks for the friend's name and email address. MYGORGEOUSCENTS will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. MYGORGEOUSCENTS stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact MYGORGEOUSCENTS at [support@Mygorgeouscents.com](mailto:support@Mygorgeouscents.com) to request the removal of this information from their database.   
**Return to Index.**

  


**12\. SECURITY**   
This web site takes every precaution to protect Users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, the information is protected both online and off-Line. When the MYGORGEOUSCENTS registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with encryption software. While MYGORGEOUSCENTS uses encryption to protect sensitive information online, MYGORGEOUSCENTS also uses its best efforts to protect user-information off-line. User information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in MYGORGEOUSCENTS offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. If you have any questions about the security at MYGORGEOUSCENTS, you can send an email to [support@Mygorgeouscents.com](mailto:support@Mygorgeouscents.com)

**13\. SUPPLEMENTATION OF INFORMATION**   
In order for MYGORGEOUSCENTS' website to properly fulfill its obligation to customers, it may be necessary to supplement the information MYGORGEOUSCENTS receives with information from 3rd party sources. FOR SPECIAL OFFERS, MYGORGEOUSCENTS may send new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members may occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our Users MYGORGEOUSCENTS presents the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below.

**14\. CORRECTION/UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION**   
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can usually be done by emailing our Customer Support at: [support@Mygorgeouscents.com](mailto:support@Mygorgeouscents.com)  
**Return to Index.**

  


**15\. OPT-OUT**  
MYGORGEOUSCENTS Users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their information used for purposes not directly related to MYGORGEOUSCENTS' site at the point where MYGORGEOUSCENTS asks for information. For example, our order form has an opt-out mechanism so Users who do not wish to receive marketing material may keep their email address off of our lists. Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at [support@Mygorgeouscents.com](mailto:support@Mygorgeouscents.com)  
**Return to Index.**

  


**16\. NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES**  
If MYGORGEOUSCENTS changes its privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our Users are aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point MYGORGEOUSCENTS changes its privacy policy, MYGORGEOUSCENTS will notify users by way an update of this Policy.
