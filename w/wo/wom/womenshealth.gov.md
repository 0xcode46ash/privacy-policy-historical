## Information Automatically Collected and Stored

When you browse through any website, certain personal information about you can be collected. We automatically collect and temporarily store the following information about your visit: 

  * The name of the domain you use to access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are using an America Online account, or stanford.edu, if you are connecting from Stanford University's domain);
  * The date and time of your visit; 
  * The pages you visited; and 
  * The address of the website you came from when you came to visit. 



We use this information for statistical purposes and to help us make our site more useful to visitors. Unless it is specifically stated otherwise, no additional information will be collected about you. 

## How womenshealth.gov Collects Information

Womenshealth.gov uses Google Analytics measurement software to collect the information listed under, Information Automatically Collected and Stored, above. Google Analytics collects information automatically and continuously. No personally identifiable information is collected. The womenshealth.gov staff conducts analyses and reports on the aggregated data from Google Analytics. The reports are only available to womenshealth.gov web staff, and other designated staff who require this information to perform their duties.

Womenshealth.gov retains this data as long as needed to support the mission of the womenshealth.gov and the Office on Women's Health.

## How Are Persistent Cookies Used?

The Office of Management and Budget Memo [M-10-22, Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-22.pdf) allows federal agencies to use session and persistent cookies and defines our use of persistent cookies as "Usage Tier 2 â€“ Multi-session without Personally Identifiable Information (PII)." The policy says, "This tier encompasses any use of multi-session web measurement and customization technologies when no PII is collected."

We use persistent cookies to help us recognize new and returning visitors to womenshealth.gov. Persistent cookies remain on your computer between visits to womenshealth.gov until they expire. We do not use this technology to identify you or any other individual site visitor. Womenshealth.gov is running the American Customer Satisfaction Survey (ACSI), which uses persistent cookies to block repeated invitations to take the ACSI survey.

## How Do I Disable Cookies?

If you do not wish to have session or persistent cookies placed on your computer, you can disable them using your web browser. If you opt out of cookies, you will still have access to all information and resources womenshealth.gov provides. Instructions for disabling or opting out of cookies in the most popular browsers are located at <http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml>. Please note that by following the instructions to opt-out of cookies, you will disable cookies from all sources, not just those from womenshealth.gov. 

## Personally Provided Information

You do not have to give us personal information to use this website. 

If you choose to provide us with information about yourself through an e-mail message, form, survey, etc., we will only maintain the information as long as needed to respond to your question or to fulfill the stated purpose of the communication. 

If you use our contact form, we will send an automated confirmation e-mail to the address you provide.

For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, we employ software programs to monitor traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. In the event of authorized law enforcement investigations, and pursuant to any required legal process, information from these sources may be used to help identify an individual. 

## Systems of Records

Electronically submitted information is maintained and destroyed pursuant to the Federal Records Act and in some cases may be subject to the Privacy Act. If information that you submit is to be used in a Privacy Act system of records, there will be a Privacy Act Notice provided.
