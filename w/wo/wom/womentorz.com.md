How Information Is Used, SHARED AND DISCLOSED

WOMENTORZ uses Personal, Non-Personal and Financial Information, among other things, to analyze and monitor system performance, analyze internal business systems, improve WOMENTORZ Service, fulfill requests for additional products and services, contact you, and conduct research. The use and protection of information from users of the WOMENTORZ Service is an important component of WOMENTORZ’s business. Except as otherwise as set forth in this section, WOMENTORZ will use reasonable efforts to provide you with notice when your information might be provided to third parties and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information in many cases. Examples of how WOMENTORZ shares and discloses your information is as follows:

 a)      Legal . WOMENTORZ will use information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, other facets of the legal process or to establish/exercise WOMENTORZ’s legal rights or defend against legal claims. WOMENTORZ will share Personal Information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of WOMENTORZ's Terms of Use or as otherwise required by law.

 b)     Business Transfers . As WOMENTORZ continues to develop its business and new products and features, WOMENTORZ might reorganize as a business entity, acquire entities, subsidiaries, or business units, or enter into joint ventures with third parties. In any of these types of transactions, your information may be one of the transferred business assets but will remain subject to any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless you consent otherwise). In the event that all or substantially all of WOMENTORZ’s assets are acquired or WOMENTORZ merges with a third party, your information will likely be one of the transferred assets. You understand and agree that WOMENTORZ reserves the right to transfer any information collected from you in the case of any such transfer. In such event, WOMENTORZ will use reasonable efforts to notify you before Personal Information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. .

 c)      Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control . WOMENTORZ may develop products, provide services, or sell product lines jointly with third party businesses, and in these cases WOMENTORZ may share your information related to those transactions with such third party. In other situations, WOMENTORZ might use third-party companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, processing payments, hosting, data storage, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. WOMENTORZ will provide such entities with access to certain information needed to perform their functions, but will take measures to ensure that they may not use it for other purposes. WOMENTORZ shares information only as described above and third parties that are either subject to this Privacy Policy or to a privacy policy at least as protective as this Privacy Policy.

 d)     With Your Consent . In other situations, if you provide consent with respect to the use and/or sharing of your information, WOMENTORZ will do so in accordance with the particular circumstances.

Security

While no security system is completely secure, WOMENTORZ takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access or disclosure of the information it collects; this includes, but not limited to, ensuring that all Personal and Financial Information is disclosed only on a “need to know” basis and stored in physically secured environments.

Despite WOMENTORZ’s efforts, you also play an important role in protecting against unauthorized access to your User Account information, password and computer. WOMENTORZ recommends that you always log out of your User Account if you leave your computer unattended and/or are using a shared computer
