Cofounder and President of womensforum.com

Dear Friends,

I hope this finds you well and enjoying what finally seems (a bit) like spring.

I find that every now and then, when life gets harried and I'm rushing around at a million miles an hour, that somehow, someway, the universe finds a way to slow me down and show me (yet again), what's really important in life. 

JJust yesterday, I was playing outside with my son, thinking about work and laundry and work and more laundry...when I stopped to look at his perfectly blissful face 

Morgan and I were playing--simply playing. Running around the yard, climbing up and down the slide, and collecting twigs (a first for me, LOL).
