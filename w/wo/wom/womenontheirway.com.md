Wyndham International, Inc. Privacy Policy   
  
This site is owned and operated by Wyndham International, Inc. Here at Wyndham International, we recognize that many visitors to our Site are concerned about both the information they provide to us and how we treat that information. So we've developed the Privacy Policy described below. We may update or change the Privacy Policy from time to time, so please check in occasionally.

Our Policy   
  
Wyndham International respects the privacy of every individual who visits our Site or responds to our interactive advertisements. At our Site, we don't collect personally identifiable information from individuals unless they provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. We don't require you to register or provide information to us in order to view our Site. If you register in order to use various features of our Site, we use the information you supply for the purpose of providing the services you've requested. If you agreed to follow-up contacts by us or asked us to be put on our mailing list when you registered, we may contact you from time to time. You can always change your preference for follow-up contacts just by e-mailing us at any time. We don't share any personal information you give us with anyone outside of Wyndham International. 

In the e-mail section of our Site, we ask for some personally identifiable information, such as your name, address and phone number. We use this information only if we need to contact you directly because our attempts to contact you by e-mail were unsuccessful. We don't share your personal information with anyone outside of Wyndham International. We don't use your e-mail address for any purpose other than responding to the message you've sent. Wyndham International does not intend to collect any personally identifiable information from individuals under thirteen years of age. Where appropriate, we will specifically instruct children not to submit such information on our Web sites or advertisements. If a child has provided us with personally identifiable information, a parent or guardian of that child may contact us at the e-mail address or mailing address listed in this Privacy Statement if he or she would like this information deleted from our records and we will use reasonable efforts to delete the child's information from our databases. 

Our Site sometimes includes notices of promotions we are conducting, and we may permit you to enter electronically in some cases. If that occurs, we will use the information you provide for the purpose of conducting the promotion (e.g., to contact you if you're a winner). We don't share the information you give us with anyone outside of Wyndham International. 

Wyndham treats all customer information as confidential and regularly monitors access to such information and its use within Wyndham by its employees to ensure that the level of privacy described in this Policy is maintained. Wyndham has also adopted security measures intended to prevent an unauthorized third party, such as a hacker, from gaining access to Wyndham databases.   
  
Cookies   
Like most companies, we use "cookie" technology on our Site. When you log in, the cookie tells us whether you've visited us before or are a new visitor. The cookie doesn't track any personal information about you or provide us with any way to contact you, and the cookie doesn't extract any information from your computer. 

Wyndham International uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, Bluestreak. These files enable Bluestreak to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our Web site. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with Bluestreak. Bluestreak cookies are identified only by a numeric ID code, and are never correlated to personally identifiable information (your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address). This information is not specific to an individual user, and is used in the aggregate. It should be noted that while cookies reside in a browser until they are deleted, Bluestreak only tracks pertinent advertising-related user behavior (ex: some users visited a Web site after viewing an ad). For more information about Bluestreak, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to <http://bluestreak.com/aboutus_privacypolicy.htm>.

Wyndham Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel GIFs - that allow Wyndham to count users who have visited those pages. Web beacons do not access or capture your personal information; they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about Wyndham Web site usage. You may find more information about Web beacons at the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).   
  
Credit Card Security   
Wyndham values your security and privacy with all online transactions. Wyndham uses secure socket layer (SSL) to protect your personal information. SSL is the industry standard for secure commerce transactions. It prevents your personal information from being read by someone else as it travels across the Internet. All of your personal information is encrypted, including credit card number, name and address.
