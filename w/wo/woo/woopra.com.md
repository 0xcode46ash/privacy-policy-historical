# Woopra, Inc. Privacy Policy — Woopra

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how Woopra, Inc. (“Woopra”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and shares the information, including personal data, provided to us through our website [www.woopra.com](https://www.woopra.com/) (the “Site”), our mobile applications (“Mobile Apps”), and the services available through our Site and Mobile Apps (collectively, the Site, the Mobile Apps, and the services available through them are the “Services”). It also describes the choices that certain individuals have regarding use, access, and correction of their personal data. 

We collect information about clients who contract with us for certain services (our “Customers”) and the end users of our Customers (“End Users”). This Policy describes how we collect, use, and share information provided to us by our Customers or their End Users (collectively, Customers and End Users are “you” throughout this Policy). Where there are distinctions in how we handle information of Customers or End Users, we will refer specifically to either Customers or End Users. It is important to understand that this Policy does not apply to our Customers’ collection, use, or sharing of End User data. To the extent that we collect or handle any data on behalf of our Customers, we do so at their instruction. 

By using any of our Services, you agree that your information, including personal data, will be handled as described in this Policy. Your use of our Services, and any dispute over privacy, is subject to this Policy and our [Terms of Service](https://www.woopra.com/tos), including its applicable limitations on damages and the resolution of disputes. The [Terms of Service](https://www.woopra.com/tos) are incorporated by reference into this Policy.

## EU & Swiss Privacy Shield

Woopra, Inc. participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. We are committed to subjecting all personal data received from EU member countries and Switzerland in reliance on each Privacy Shield Framework and the Privacy Shield principles of Notice; Choice; Accountability for Onward Transfer; Security; Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation; Access; and Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability (collectively, the “Principles”). To learn more about the Privacy Shield Frameworks, and to view our certification, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s [Privacy Shield website](https://www.privacyshield.gov/). [https://www.privacyshield.gov] We collect, process, disclose, and transfer personal data from the EU as described in this Policy.

Woopra is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives under the Privacy Shield Frameworks then subsequently transfers to a third party, and Woopra will remain liable under the Principles if a third party processes personal data in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Woopra proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Woopra is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

We encourage EU individuals who have questions or complaints about how we process their personal data under either Privacy Shield Framework to contact us directly at [privacy@woopra.com](mailto:privacy@woopra.com). We will work to resolve your issue as quickly as possible, but in any event no later than 45 days of receipt. If you have an unresolved concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>. 

Under certain conditions, more fully described on the [Privacy Shield website](https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint), you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

## Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms

We and our partners use technologies such as cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.

The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.

**Analytics.** We use automated applications, such as our own application, to track our visitors and evaluate usage of our Services. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Services. We use these tools to help us improve our Services, performance, and user experiences. We may use and share your personal data with third parties as further described in this Policy.

This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. 

We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Services or to manage our advertising on other services.

We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any third-party website or application you visit or use.

## Security

We have taken steps to help protect the personal data we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.

You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.
