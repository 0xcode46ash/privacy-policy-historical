# Woodlands Online - Privacy Policy

### Woodlands Onlineâ€™s Membership Privacy Policy

  
As an Internet user, you have the right to expect any Web Site to disclose its privacy policies which explain how your personal information is collected, used, and shared. You also have a responsibility to choose which Web Sites you feel comfortable disclosing such information to. 

**Item A: Why do you need my personal information for Member Registration?**

In order to provide community services and benefits to you as a Member, Woodlands Online maintains a limited amount of your personal information given during Registration and the optional Member Profile Survey. Your identifying information protects your uniqueness as a Woodlands Online member, preventing others from using the same log-in or Message Boards Screen Name. 

We also compile general Member info to create an in-house demographic profile of our Members for the sole purpose of bringing more relevant content and services to the Woodlands Online community of residents, users and businesses. We always welcome and rely upon your suggestions for improvements and additional services.

 **Item B: Who has access to my Member Registration & Profile Survey information?**

First, we pledge that Woodlands Online will under no circumstances willingly give access to your Registration or Profile Survey information to any third party for any purpose, either commercial or otherwise. Even in-house use of your information is restricted and password-protected: only a limited number of our Professional Staff can view your personal demographic information. 

The information you entrust to us is protected on a secure web server; we have made and continue to make substantial efforts to achieve a well protected environment. However, Woodlands Online - nor any Web Site operator - can completely guarantee that your information will be immune from unauthorized access. 

**Item C: What about Cookies?**

Woodlands Online Registered Members are required to have Cookies enabled on their computers. During a web session on Woodlands Online, we rely on this technology to allow you to access your Registered Member profile and My WOL Member Info page as many times as you wish while using the other pages of our site. Once initially logged-in, you will not be prompted for your log-in name and password again unless you log out. This mechanism is employed solely for your convenience and for no other purpose.

 **Item D: Is any of my information public?**

Please be aware that, while your Registration and Profile information is always confidential, all of your listing submissions and postings to the public pages of Woodlands Online are available for all users to view. Therefore, listing submissions and postings are not private information. We urge you to always use caution and discretion when posting any personally identifying information about yourself or your household. 

Some of our listing submission forms require contact information such as name and phone number; however, these pages declare whether or not your personal information will appear on the listing. In many cases, you can select which pieces of information you want others to see on the live Web Site.

 **Item E: What will Woodlands Online do with my public information?**

Posting communications on or through the Web Site automatically grants Woodlands Online a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, edit, translate, distribute, perform, and display the information alone or as part of other works in any form, media, or technology whether now known or hereafter developed. The foregoing grants shall include the right to exploit any proprietary rights in such communication, including but not limited to rights under copyright, trademark, service mark or patent laws under any relevant jurisdiction.

 **Item F: Woodlands Online Liability Disclaimer:**

Woodlands Online specifically disclaims any liability with regard to any actions resulting from your submissions and postings to the public portion of the Web Site. Generally, any communication which you post to the Web Site is considered to be non-confidential and must comply with the Terms of Service.

 **Item G: Changes to This Privacy Policy:**

Woodlands Online may from time to time update our Privacy Policy. Registered Members will be notified by email of any significant changes, or a prominent announcement will be placed on the Web Site.
