Cookies  
  
Some websites store information in a small text file called a "cookie" on your hard disk. Cookies contain information about you and your preferences. For example, it might contain a record of which pages within the site you visited, to help the site customise the view for you the next time you visit.

Only the information that you provide, or the choices you make, while visiting a website can be stored in a cookie. For example, the site cannot determine your email address unless you choose to type it. Allowing a website to create a cookie does not give that or any other site access to the rest of your computer and only the site that created the cookie can read it.

Wool Overs will only use the cookies created to personalise and secure your experience. What this means is that when you use the Wool Overs will be able to keep certain settings for you for when you return. It also means that you do not need to pass security details on every screen as we store them for you during the time you spend browsing our site.
