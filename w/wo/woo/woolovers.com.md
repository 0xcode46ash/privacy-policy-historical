**Secure Ordering**

We provide complete security when you order online with Wool Overs. Our secure server (SSL), with 128-bit encryption software, encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. This means your card details can't be read by anyone other than the secure server. 

We also follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given us, to prevent unauthorised access or improper use. Our security procedures mean we may occasionally request proof of identity before we are able to disclose sensitive information to you. Wool Overs has a strict internal policy, with which members of staff must comply as a condition of employment, and no external access to the system is permitted. If you have any queries about the security of our system, please contact info@woolovers.co.uk

**Cookies**

Some websites store information in a small text file called a 'cookie' on your hard disk. Cookies contain information about you and your preferences. For example, it might contain a record of which pages of the website you visited, to help the site customise the view the next time you visit.

Only the information that you provide, or the choices you make while visiting a website, can be stored in a cookie. For example, the site cannot determine your email address unless you choose to enter it. Allowing a website to create a cookie does not give that site, or any other site, access to the rest of your computer. Only the site which created the cookie can read it.

Wool Overs will only use the cookies created to personalise and secure your experience. What this means is, when you use the Wool Overs website, it will be able to store certain settings for you for when you return. It also means you do not need to enter security details on every screen, as we store them for you during the time you spend browsing our site.

If you are a registered user, you are responsible for uses of the Service by you, and those using your login information. Any breach of these terms and conditions by anyone to whom you disclose your login information, will be treated as if the breach had been committed by you. This will not relieve you of your obligations under these terms and conditions. You agree to provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself, if you register to use any part of the Service which requires such. You agree to maintain and promptly update this registration data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. You must notify us immediately if you suspect, or become aware of any non-authorised person using your login information. 

**Choice of Law and Jurisdiction**

These terms and conditions are subject to the laws of England, and by using the Service, you agree not only to be bound by them, but also agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts in connection with any dispute, save that we have the right at our sole discretion to commence and pursue proceedings in alternative jurisdictions. 

**General Information**

Wool Overs reserves the right to change these terms and conditions at any time. Such revised terms and conditions will be posted on the Service. By continued use of the Service after such terms and conditions have been posted, you agree to abide by such changes.
