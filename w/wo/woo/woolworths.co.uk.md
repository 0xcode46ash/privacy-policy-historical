If you've yet to buy anything over the Internet then you may be asking yourself a few questions. Is it safe? What if there's a mistake? Will anyone else get hold of my details? Well, we'd like to assure you now that shopping this way is as safe as shopping anywhere else, if not more so, as with us you can only access your details when you enter your own personal, unique password. So here we'd like to put your mind at rest, answer a few of your questions and give you all the facts!

Don't forget, you can only access your details by keying in your own password known only to you. And on top of this, there is a full record of everything you've bought with us that you can check at any time, as well as a receipt detailing every purchase you've made.
