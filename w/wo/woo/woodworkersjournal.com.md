We do not share these numbers with other organizations.

**Cookies**

The paragraphs below outline some of the common practices used by a majority of publishing and ecommerce sites. A couple of terms you will need to know:

_Cookies_ – These are small text files that are stored directly on your computer. They make it easier for the server to recognize your computer as you click from page to page (to keep track of your shopping cart as you browse our site, for example). The cookies do not actually contain any personal data.

_Pixel Tags_ – these are very tiny images (smaller than the periods in this paragraph). They are there to inform our web server or e-mail server that you have opened an e-mail, for example, and to communicate other actions.

The Woodworker’s Journal website, online services, interactive applications, e-mail messages, and advertisements may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our website people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of our communications and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information.

Woodworker’s Journal and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to “remember” how you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with our sites more convenient and personal. You may set your web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. However, should you decide not to accept cookies from our sites, you will limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our sites.

As is true of most websites, our web servers gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Woodworker’s Journal may use this information, as compiled in the aggregate and without personally identifying characteristics, in our marketing and advertising services.

Pixel tags enable us to send e-mail messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.
