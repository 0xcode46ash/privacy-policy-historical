# Woodcraft - Privacy Policy

**Our commitment to privacy**  
Your privacy is important to us. Woodcraft is a long time member of The DMA (Direct Marketing Association) and supports their Privacy Promise Program. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available at the bottom of every single page on the website.   
**  
What information do we collect? How do we use it?**  
When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, credit-card number and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your orders, and notify you of your order status. Your phone number is necessary for FedEx Expedited shipping and International shipping. It will also be used to contact you if there is a question regarding your order. Phone numbers will not be used for sales calls.

We occasionally make our customer list (postal mailing list only) available to carefully screened companies whose products may interest you. If you do not wish to receive their mailings, we will be sure your name is removed from the list we share with other organizations. Please contact us at the address listed below and provide us with your exact name and address.

Woodcraft Supply Corp  
PO Box 1686  
Parkersburg, WV 26102, USA  
1-800-535-4482

Or send us an email at custserv@woodcraft.com.

If you supply us with your postal address on-line you may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings from Woodcraft, please contact us at the address listed above. 

You may voluntarily sign up to receive our Woodcraft eNewsletter to learn more about special offers. For this service we need an e-mail address and zip code which we use to send the information you requested. Email addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address, phone number and e-mail address, so we can administer the contest and notify winners. 

We personalize your shopping experience by using your purchases to shape our recommendations about other merchandise that might be of interest to you. We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the store. 

**How do we protect customer information?**  
Personal information is collected when an account is set up for a purchase transaction using SSL encryption. Only that information which is needed to complete the transaction is required. Your account is password protected, and you can access it at anytime.

**What about "cookies"?**  
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information, but they do enable us to provide features such as 1-Click shopping and to store items in your shopping cart between visits. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Even without a cookie, you can still use most of the features in our store, including placing items in your shopping cart and purchasing them. 

**Our commitment to children's privacy**  
Woodcraft's web site contains no objectionable material and is considered to be "child safe." Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. 

**In summary**  
We are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect on the site to make shopping at Woodcraft possible and to enhance your overall shopping experience. 

**Your consent**  
By using our web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Woodcraft. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page, so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it. 

**Tell us what you think**  
Woodcraft welcomes your questions and comments about privacy. Please e-mail us at custserv@woodcraft.com.
