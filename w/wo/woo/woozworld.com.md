## 1\. Does Woozworld Collect Any Personal Information about Me If I’m Minor? 

Woozworld doesn’t require anyone to share any personal information about them in order to enjoy any of our websites. You can visit our sites without any need to register with us. However, most of our sites contain special sections and privileges for members that register.

The personal information we ask for is usually pseudo and last name, mailing address, and an e-mail address. See below for how we use this information. 

## 2\. What Ordering Information Does Woozworld Collect In Our Online Stores? 

We may offer opportunities to purchase products in our online stores. Customers must be over the age of 18 with a valid credit card. When a customer places an order or requests a catalogue online, we collect information associated with the transaction, which will include the customer’s name, mailing and emailing address, products ordered, and credit card information. We ask for this information so that we may fulfill the order or catalogue request. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect credit card data during transmission to our website, and adopt careful internal procedures to safeguard this information in our system. 

When a customer places an order online, we will send a confirming e-mail message. We may also send an occasional e-mail featuring a special promotion or product that may be of interest to customers. Any customer who prefers not to receive an online order confirmation or promotional e-mail should indicate this preference on the online store order form. If you do receive an e-mail from us that you would rather not receive, simply follow the «unsubscribe» instructions included in the e-mail.
