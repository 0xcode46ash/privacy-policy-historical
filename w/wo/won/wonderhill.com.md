# WonderHill.com - WonderHill Privacy Policy

## PRIVACY POLICY

This Privacy Policy is effective as of June 10, 2009.

At WonderHill, we believe privacy is very important. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we collect as well as steps we take to keep your private information private. Our aim is to help you make an educated decision when choosing to use the site and/or share information with us.

#### What This Privacy Policy Covers

This privacy policy pertains to the use of the WonderHill web site at [http://www.wonderhill.com](http://wonderhill.com/), and the WonderHill services.

This Privacy Policy applies only to websites and services that are owned and operated by WonderHill. We do not exercise control over the sites displayed as search results or linked to or from within our various services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit information from you. We encourage you to read their privacy policies before you enter into an exchange with them.

WonderHill may allow other companies to serve advertisements on its website. These third-party advertisers use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the website. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content to a certain audience.

This privacy policy covers how WonderHill treats information that WonderHill collects and receives.

Your use of the WonderHill website, the WonderHill services and any information you provide on the website is subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

#### The Information We Collect and How We Use It

Several WonderHill services do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information. Such services include viewing user profiles and our forums. 

For these no-registration-required services WonderHill collects the following information:

  * Cookies: A cookie is a small file containing a unique string of characters that is sent from the WonderHill servers and saved by your browser software. Using the cookie approach provides maximum privacy protection while also allowing WonderHill to provide the desired personalized services. Browsers are typically set to accept cookies, however, you can change the settings on your browser to notify you when a site is sending a cookie to your browser or, alternatively, to refuse cookies altogether. If your cookies are disabled, these no-registration-required WonderHill services may not function properly. If the WonderHill cookie is cleaned from your browser, and you haven’t registered with personally identifiable information, then all your preferences will be lost, and you will need to reset your preferences to continue using WonderHill’s personalized services. 
  * Log information: When you use WonderHill services, our servers automatically record the data that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These "server logs" include data such as browser type, Internet Protocol address, your web request, the date and time of your requests, and your WonderHill cookie(s) that uniquely identify your browser. 
  * Clear Gifs Information: When you use the WonderHill website, we may employ clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons), which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of users without collecting any personally identifiable information about you. 
  * Clear gifs search query data, log information and cookies are non-personal information because such information is not collected or used in such a way that an individual user can be identified, for example, by name or email address. 
  * We use non-personal information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your current or subsequent visits to the WonderHill website; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and traffic; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; (f) access your information after you sign in; and (h) market our website to advertisers and other third parties. 



For WonderHill services where registration is required, we will collect the non-personal information described above, and in addition, we collect the following types of personal information for the following purposes (personal information is information that personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, home address, phone numbers, or other data which can be reasonably linked to such information):

  * Information you provide: When you sign up for a WonderHill service that requires registration, we ask you for personal information. Examples of that information include your name, email address, account password, etc. For the purpose of providing you with a better experience or improving the quality of our services, we may combine the information you submitted with information from other WonderHill websites or services. For certain services, we may provide you the choice of opting out from combining such information. 
  * Inviting Friends: When you invite new users to use WonderHill, and when you send messages through WonderHill, we collect and store those messages, including email addresses and content. If you use a third-party address book like Yahoo or Hotmail to send invitations to friends, we do not store your password to those services. 
  * If you invite another person to join WonderHill, we use the name and email address you provide us to contact that person and, if necessary, remind that person that he or she has been invited to join WonderHill. All invitees are given the option not to receive further invitations from WonderHill.
  * User communications: If you send email to WonderHill, we may retain those communications in order to reply to your inquiries, fulfill your requests and to improve our services. 
  * Affiliated sites: Some of WonderHill’s services are provided in cooperation with other online services and websites. Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to WonderHill in order to deliver the service to you on the WonderHill site. This Privacy Policy also governs how we process such information. The affiliated sites may have different privacy practices and we suggest you also read their privacy policies. 
  * Sensitive Information: We will not collect or use sensitive information for reasons other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service sections, unless we obtain your prior consent.
