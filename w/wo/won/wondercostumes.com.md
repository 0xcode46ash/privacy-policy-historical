Manufacturers may change costume styles without notice. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Wonder Costumes will reflect any changes in the website descriptions and images as soon as we become aware of them. Thank you for your understanding.

Please note that some manufacture’s size chart and costume package mentions child medium size as (7-8), but the actual Medium child size fits sizes (7-10).  Some child costumes run small so we recommend always purchasing one size up.  We apologize for the inconvenience this may cause you.
