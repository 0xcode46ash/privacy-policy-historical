# Wonga.com Privacy Policy | Wonga.com® Official Site

Welcome to [Wonga.com](https://www.wonga.com/homepage.aspx). We believe you deserve the utmost respect when it comes to the security and use of your personal information, so we have described how we look after your information as clearly as possible. 

Our Privacy Policy applies to you, our customer. Throughout this Privacy Policy “you” means the customer.

We will keep your personal data confidential and only give it others for the purposes explained in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy will apply both while you, the customer, has a loan from us and afterwards, but we may change the Privacy Policy from time to time. We will put any updates on our website.

#### Security

We recognise how important it is to protect and manage the personal and financial information you share with us.  We protect that information using secure socket layer (SSL) encryption technology and by limiting employee access on a need-to-know basis.  We store data in encrypted form on computers and control access via secure web pages.  We employ firewalls and other security technologies to protect our servers from external attack.

Our security systems meet or exceed industry standards and we are constantly monitoring internet developments to ensure our systems evolve as required.  We also test our systems regularly to make sure our security mechanisms are up to date.

#### Collecting your data

We collect information about you in a number of ways.  For example, directly from you when an online application is completed, when you give us information or provide feedback while the loan is outstanding, or afterwards.  We also collect information from outside sources such as credit bureaux and customer service providers.

#### Additional data collection

In addition to the personal and financial information you submit, we may collect information about your computer including, where available, your IP address, operating system and browser type - for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.

This is statistical data about browsing actions and patterns and does not identify any individual.  We may also obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer, which again does not identify any individual.  This information is sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server which enables the webserver to identify and track the web browser.  For more information about cookies, please visit [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).  Cookies enable us to improve our service to you, estimate our audience size and usage patterns, store information about your preferences and recognise you when you return to our site.

We use cookies to provide an enhanced experience for our customers and to provide our service to you.  Cookies allow us to remember your preferences and personalise the web site, including the personalised welcome message and Trust Rating that you see when you visit the site as a returning customer. Cookies also help us understand what customers like to look at on our site, for example, we use cookies to count the number of visits to particular pages or how many customers complete an application. This information does not allow us to identify any particular customer but helps us to understand our customers’ needs and improve our service to you. We also set cookies to manage the loan application and account management process which are critical to providing our service to you.

We will set a cookie on the landing page but as soon as possible we will provide you with information about our use of cookies. By using our site, you agree to our use of cookies. [Find out more about cookies and how we use them](http://www.wonga.com/money/wonga-cookies/).

#### Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs) and Fraud Prevention Agencies (FPAs)

When you apply to us for a loan, we will check the following records about you (and others where applicable) :

i.    our own;

ii.   those at CRAs;

iii.  those at FPAs

Whether or not your application is successful, when CRAs receive a search from us they will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders.  Large numbers of applications within a short time period may affect your ability to obtain credit.

They, and we, may also link your records with those of your financial associate(s) including any previous and subsequent names, these links will remain on your and their files until you or they tell the agency you are no longer financially linked and the agency accepts this.

They supply to us both public (including the electoral register, county court judgements and bankruptcies) and shared credit and fraud prevention information including information about previous applications and the conduct of your accounts in your and your financial associate(s)’ name(s).

Information on applications will be sent to CRAs and will be recorded by them.

Information held by CRAs and FPAs will be disclosed to us and to other organisations to, for example:

  * prevent fraud and money laundering and to check and assess applications for credit, credit related or other facilities;
  * recover debts that you owe and trace your whereabouts;
  * manage credit accounts and other facilities and decide appropriate credit limits;
  * verify your identity;
  * make decisions on credit and other facilities for you, your financial associate (s), members of your household or your business.
  * checking details of job applicants and employees. 



CRAs and FPAs will use your information for statistical analysis about credit and other fraud.

When you borrow from us, we will give details of your loan and how you manage it to CRAs.  We may make periodic searches at CRAs and FPAs to manage our relationship with you. 

If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt and, in some cases, the length of time that the debt remains outstanding. This information may be supplied to other organisations by CRAs and FPAs to perform similar checks and to trace your whereabouts and recover debts that you owe. Records remain on file for 6 years after they are closed, whether settled by you or defaulted and may affect your ability to get credit in the future.

We will give you prior notice of a default being registered on your credit reference file.

If you give us false or inaccurate information and we have reasonable grounds to suspect fraud or we identify fraud we may record this and may also pass this information to FPAs and other organisations involved in crime and fraud prevention.

We and other organisations may access and use from other countries the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies.

The Credit Reference Agencies and Fraud Prevention Agencies that we use are : 

Callcredit Limited (registration number 03961870) with registered office at One Park Lane, Leeds, West Yorkshire, LS3 1EP

Experian Limited (registration number 00653331) with registered office at Landmark House, Experian Way, NG2 Business Park, Nottingham, NG80 1ZZ
