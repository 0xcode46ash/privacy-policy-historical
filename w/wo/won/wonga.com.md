## Security

We recognise how important it is to protect and manage the information you share with us. We protect that information using secure socket layer (SSL) encryption technology and by limiting employee access on a need-to-know basis. We store information in encrypted form on computers and control access via secure web pages. We employ firewalls and other security technologies to protect our servers from external attack.

Our security systems meet or exceed industry standards and we are constantly monitoring internet developments to ensure our systems evolve as required, however, sadly, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

## Collecting your information

We collect information about you in a number of ways:

  * directly from you when an online application is completed;
  * when you give us information or provide feedback while the loan is outstanding (or afterwards);
  * from outside sources such as credit bureaux and customer service providers to help us with customer verification and credit-related decisions.



In addition to the personal and financial information you submit (or we collect), we may collect information about your computer including, where available, your IP address, operating system and browser type - for system administration and product improvement. For more information on information collected in this way please see our [Cookies Policy](https://web.archive.org/money/wonga-cookies/).

### Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs) and Fraud Prevention Agencies (FPAs)

When you apply to us for a loan, we will check the following records about you (and others where applicable):

  1. our own;
  2. those at CRAs;
  3. those at FPAs



Whether or not your application is successful, when CRAs receive a search from us they will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders. Large numbers of applications within a short time period may affect your ability to obtain credit.

They, and we, may also link your records with those of your financial associate(s) including any previous and subsequent names, these links will remain on your and their files until you or they tell the agency you are no longer financially linked and the agency accepts this. This is called a “disassociation”, if you need to request a disassociation, please contact the CRAs directly (contact details are set out below for both Call Credit and Experian). 

The CRAs supply us with both public (including the electoral register, county court judgements and bankruptcies) and shared credit and fraud prevention information including information about previous applications and the conduct of your accounts in your and your financial associate(s)’ name(s).

We may also make periodic searches at CRAs and FPAs to manage our relationship with you.

Information provided by you on our applications will be sent to CRAs and will be recorded by them. We and other organisations may access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, CRAs and FPAs may use your information for statistical analysis. Information held by CRAs and FPAs will be disclosed to us and to other organisations in order to (for example):

  * prevent fraud and money laundering and to check and assess applications for credit, credit related or other facilities; 
  * recover debts that you owe and trace your whereabouts; 
  * manage credit accounts and other facilities and decide appropriate credit limits; 
  * verify your identity; 
  * make decisions on credit and other facilities for you, your financial associate (s), members of your household or your business;
  * check details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance; and
  * check details of job applicants and employees. 



When you borrow from us, we will give details of your loan and how you manage it to the CRAs.  If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, the CRAs will record the outstanding debt and, in some cases, the length of time that the debt remains outstanding: other organisations may see these updates and this may affect your ability to obtain credit in the future.

If you fall behind with your payments and a full payment or satisfactory proposals are not received within 28 days of a formal demand being issued, then a default notice may be recorded with the CRAs. Any records shared with CRAs will remain on file for 6 years after your account is closed, whether it has been settled by you or as a result of a default.

This information may be supplied to other organisations by CRAs and FPAs to perform similar checks and to trace your whereabouts and recover debts that you owe. Records remain on file for 6 years after they are closed, whether settled by you or defaulted.

If you give us false or inaccurate information and we have reasonable grounds to suspect fraud or we identify fraud we may record this and may also pass this information to FPAs and other organisations involved in crime and fraud prevention, law enforcement agencies may then access this information.

We and other organisations may access and use, from other countries, the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies.

The Credit Reference Agencies that we use are Callcredit Limited (registration number 03961870) with registered office at One Park Lane, Leeds, West Yorkshire, LS3 1EP; and Experian Limited (registration number 00653331) with registered office at Landmark House, Experian Way, NG2 Business Park, Nottingham, NG80 1ZZ.

### Transfer of Information

We may transfer your personal information abroad to other countries outside the UK, including to other countries in the EEA, Switzerland and South Africa. If we do so, we will ensure the information is held securely to standards as least as good as those in the UK and only used for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.

### Incomplete Applications

If you commence an application with us but this application is not completed, we will (except where you have agreed to receive occasional updates and information form us) retain your information for no more than 30 days in order for us to contact you about your application and to make it easier for you to proceed with it, if you decide to do so. Where you have agreed to receive occasional updates and information from us, we will retain your name and email address only for that purpose.

### Declined Applications

If we are unable to offer you a loan when you apply, we will keep your information for 18 months. We will keep your information for statistical analysis, fraud prevention and credit scoring purposes. During this time, we may also email you about our products and services.
