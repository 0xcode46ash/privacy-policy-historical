has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our  
firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this site 

This is how we will handle information we learn about you from your visit to our website. The information we receive depends upon what you do when visiting our site. 

 **If** **you visit our site to browse or read information such as news, weather, sports scores and the like:  
**We collect and store only the following information about you: the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account, or princeton.edu if you are connecting from Princeton University's domain); the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site.  _None of the above information can personally identify you or anyone in your household._

We use the information we collect to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our site, and to help us make our site more useful to visitors. 

**If you identify yourself by sending an E-mail** :  
You also may decide to send us personally-identifying information, for example, in an electronic mail message containing a comment or complaint. We use personally-identifying information from our online users in the event a response is requested.  It may also be used to help rectify a problem which may occur with a service to which you have subscribed. 

**If you identify yourself by completing a "comment" form:**   
We require that you use your email address when completing our online comments form.  This is to help prevent abuse or malicious use of this valuable line of communication.  We may also use your email address if you have requested a reply to a question.  Your email address, comments, and other information from the form is only stored in an archive fashion, and is not made part of any other mailing list or database.  Some of the information that you may be asked to supply (cable system, home town, etc.) is typically  used in an aggregate form for statistical or analytical purposes.  Information provided on a "comment" form or received via email as a comment may be shared with other members of our staff.    

**If you complete an online contest entry form or free offer form:**   
We may run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like their email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level).  Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences.  In most cases, your name, postal address, email address and the like on a contest entry form is used solely for our direct contact with you and for the purposes of conducting the contest.  Contact information will be used to notify contest winners and award prizes and, in some instances may be shared with the contest, offer, or survey sponsor. Anonymous survey information will be used for purposes of reporting survey results and monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Users' personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice. Any information supplied to a third party may be retained by such third party and will be out of the control of Maranatha Broadcasting Company, Inc. FCC regulations require that certain emails and correspondence sent to the television station via the site (which may include personally identifiable information, such as name and address) on matters including television signal reception, community matters, programming and suggestions for investigative reports and other similar issues, be kept in a file that is available to the public for a period of three years.

Certain contests that are offered on this site may be geared towards children. Maranatha Broadcasting Company, Inc. offers parents the opportunity to enter these contests on behalf of their children. We may ask for information such as a parent’s name, a parent’s email address, a parent’s phone number, a child’s first name, or a child’s opinion or favorite item. This information is used for the purposes of conducting the contest. Entry forms for contests geared towards children are to be completed by parents or guardians on behalf of the child. If we were to discover that an entry form were completed by a child and contained personally identifiable information, we would delete this information as quickly as practical. We will not require disclosure of more personal information regarding a child than is reasonably necessary to participate in the contest.
