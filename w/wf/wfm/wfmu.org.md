# Privacy Policy – WFMU-FM 91.1/Jersey City, NJ; 90.1/Hudson Valley, NY

**WFMU is not one of those evil multi-national conglomerates that is trying to collect as much data about you as possible so we can sell you shoes, cosmetics, and/or toilet paper. The truth is, we just don’t have the energy or the algorithms to determine the perfect mascara for your eyelash type.**

But we do care about your privacy and in order to prove to you just how much we care about your privacy, we came up with a policy. That’s love, people. Policy = love.
