**_WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC. Privacy Policy_**

                        Waste Management, Inc. (“Waste Management”, “we”, “us” or “our”) respects the preferences of our customers and other users that access this Internet site to learn about or interact with us concerning the collection, storage, access and use of their personal and business information.  Waste Management is continually developing mechanisms to enhance the user experience on this web site and to provide our users with greater choice related to information use and disclosure.  By accessing the Waste Management web site (the “Site”), you agree to the Waste Management Privacy Policy.  It is important that you review this Privacy Policy prior to registering on or using the Site.

                        In general, you can visit the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself.  Our Web servers may collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors.  This information is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the Site, pages viewed, and similar data. Waste Management uses this information to measure the use of our Site and to improve the content of our Site.  There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your name and address.  However, we will only do so when it is voluntarily submitted to us.  When any personal information is collected, we will try to let you know, at the time of collection, how we will use the information you give to us. 

                        Waste Management will use personally identifiable information voluntarily submitted to us to respond to requests you make of us.  Additionally, Waste Management may use that information to determine how we can improve our Site, business and services.  Any and all uses would comply with applicable law.  We also may use the information to contact you in connection with your requests.

                        In addition, we may use a technology called “cookies.” A cookie is a tiny element of data that a Web site (including our Site) can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. 

                        As a general rule, we do not sell or rent your personal or business information to any third party, except as described below. However, Waste Management cooperates with law enforcement and judicial inquires and other third parties to enforce laws, intellectual property and other rights.  It may be necessary to furnish your information to third parties in connection with these objectives.  Other situations may also exist in which it may be necessary to provide some or all of your information to third parties in connection with effectively maintaining and operating the Site. 

                        Waste Management reserves the right to add to, update or otherwise modify this Privacy Policy at any time and without notice.  The most current Privacy Policy will apply to all data and other information collected on the Site, no matter what version of the Privacy Policy was in effect when the information was collected. 

                        If you are using features of the Site available exclusively for Waste Management shareholders, we may need your social security number to verify your identity and share ownership. 

                        If you are using the Site to access our electronic payment system , we may need for you to provide us with certain financial information so that we may effect the payment transaction.  As part of our payment system, we will collect, store and use non-public personally identifiable information such as your name, address, credit card number, bank routing and account number, Waste Management account number and e-mail address.  In addition, the payment system will also collect information regarding the actual bill payment transaction, including the date and amount paid.  Waste Management will store and protect this information in the same manner we store and protect other personal customer information, and this is true both for our current customers as well as our former customers. We will disclose information to third parties about your account or the transfers you make:

(i) Where it is necessary for completing transactions you authorize (for example, to an outside service provider that operates the electronic payment system for us), or

(ii) In order to verify the existence and condition of your account for a third party, such as a credit bureau or

(iii) In order to comply with government agency or court orders, or

(iv) If you give us your written permission. 

We may disclose all of the information we collect about you to our affiliates who offer waste management and disposal services, and to nonaffiliated third parties that perform services on our behalf, including marketing services, or other parties with whom we have joint marketing agreements.  We reserve the right to provide non-personal identifying information such as aggregate data to third parties. 

Waste Management uses commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to help ensure the security, integrity and privacy of all personal information. However, due to the inherent insecurity of the Internet, no security measures should be viewed as one hundred percent effective in all circumstances.  Therefore, Waste Management is not responsible for any breach of its security or for the actions of any third parties that may obtain any personal information.
