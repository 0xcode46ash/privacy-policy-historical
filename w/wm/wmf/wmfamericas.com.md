# Privacy Policy | WMF Americas

**WMF Americas, Inc. Privacy Policy**

We work hard to maintain the security of your personal information and to ensure customer satisfaction at all levels of our interaction with you, the consumer.

Therefore, we work diligently to respect and care for your private information in observance of the valid national and European data protection policies. Personal information is only recognized, collected and stored if it is lawful under these provisions.

**Personal Information**

Personal information is deemed to be information about your identity, name, address, and telephone number. Information such as your favorite cooking recipe does not relate to your individual identity and is, therefore, not classified as personal information that needs to be protected.

Because confidentiality is very important to us, we will carefully handle your personal data and assure you that any information of a personal nature will not be passed on to third parties and will not be used for spam (unwanted electronic junk mail or junk newsgroup postings).

It is, however, your decision whether you input this information.

WMF Americas Group Inc. takes great care in maintaining the security of your personal information, and your data is saved on an extra secure server. Access to this server is only permitted to people who are authorized to take care of technical matters.
