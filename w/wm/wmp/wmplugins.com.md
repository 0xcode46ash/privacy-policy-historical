# wmplugins.com - Privacy Statement

_This document was last updated December 18, 2002._

Microsoft is committed to protecting your privacy. You can visit most pages on our site without giving us any information about yourself. But sometimes we need information to provide services that you request. This privacy statement explains what data we collect and how we use that data.

This statement applies to WMPlugins.com only; it does not apply to other online or offline Microsoft sites, products, or services. Please read the complete WMPlugins.com privacy statement.

## Collection of your Personal Information

When we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you, we will ask you for it. Generally, this information is requested when you are registering before entering a contest, ordering e-mail newsletters, joining a limited-access premium site, signing up for an event or training, or when purchasing and/or registering Microsoft products. Personal information collected by WMPlugins.com often is limited to e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a service you requested.

When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register your purchase electronically. We keep this registration information on file with any information you've already given us on previous visits to our Web site.

WMPlugins.com also collects certain information about your computer hardware and software. This information may include: your IP address, browser type, operating system, domain name, access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of WMPlugins.com.

WMPlugins.com also collects information about which pages our customers visit within WMPlugins.com. This site visitation data is identified only by a unique ID number, and it is never linked with personal information unless a user consents as described below.

WMPlugins.com uses .NET Passport as its registration and authentication service. When you sign in to this site using .NET Passport, you will be asked to provide your e-mail address and a password to sign you in. This same Passport sign-in allows you to access many other Passport participating sites and services. To learn more about the Passport service, the information stored in the Passport profile, and how Passport uses and protects your personal information, please read the [.NET Passport privacy statement](http://www.passport.net/Consumer/PrivacyPolicy.asp?PPlcid=1033).

## Use of your Personal Information

We use your personal information for the following purposes:

  * To ensure our site is relevant to your needs.
  * To deliver services, such as newsletters, events, training, or software that you request or purchase.
  * To help us create and publish content most relevant to you.
  * To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information, and other new services from Microsoft, if you so request.
  * To allow you access to limited-entry areas of our site as appropriate.



We will merge site-visitation data with anonymous demographic information for research purposes, and we may use this information in aggregate to provide more relevant content. In some limited-entry sections of WMPlugins.com, with your approval, we will combine site-visitation data with your personal information in order to provide you with personalized content. If you decline permission, we will not provide you the personalized service and wonâ€™t merge your personal information with site-visitation data.

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

Microsoft may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Microsoft or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Microsoft and its family of Web sites, or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Microsoft employees, users of Microsoft products or services, or members of the public.

Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. Microsoft abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.

Control of your Personal Information 

When you register, or otherwise give us personal information, WMPlugins.com will not share that information with third parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions already listed. It will only be used for the purposes stated above.

WMPlugins.com may send out periodic e-mails informing you of technical service or security issues related to a product or service you requested, or confirming you requested a product or service.
