WMAL-AM PRIVACY POLICY  
  
Last Updated 10/20/99  
  
The policies below are applicable to WMAL-AM and other sites on the World Wide Web portion of the Internet owned and operated by ABC Radio, Washington, DC (collectively referred to as "ABC").  
  
ABC collects personally identifying information during contests or sweepstakes, during registration for sites that require subscription and in connection with interactive areas requiring registration. In addition, information is collected in certain portions of sites in which guests provide content submissions and suggestions or participate in interactive online activities (e.g., community postings, voting, chat, games, online shopping, surveys, applications for show tickets and bulletin boards). ABC may use such information to fulfill prizes and purchases, track compliance with our rules and terms and conditions, or for editorial and feedback purposes (to the extent that is explained when guests provide the information). In the event ABC plans to post any such information on a site, guests are provided prior notification of such posting and given the option of preventing such posting.  
  
Policies for Individuals Under 13  
  
ABC encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the interactive activities offered on the sites. No information should be submitted to or posted at ABC 's Web sites by guests under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, ABC does not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever. All registrants receive e-mail confirming their registration. In addition, when a guest under 13 registers, his/her parent or guardian receives an e-mail alerting them to that registration and providing instructions on how the parent or guardian can delete the registration if so desired. Although guests under 13 years of age are allowed to participate in contests, if such a guest wins, notification and prizes are sent to the parents or guardians. No information collected from guests under 13 years of age is used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either inside or outside ABC. ABC does not post guests' e-mail addresses on ABC Web sites. It is our goal to make your visits to our sites easy and enjoyable.  
  
Policies for Individuals 13 Years of Age or Older  
  
For visitors who are 13 years of age or over, information submitted at the time of registration or submission may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by ABC and may be shared with other companies that have been prescreened by ABC. If a guest objects to such use for any reason, he/she may stop that use -- either by e-mail request or by modifying his/her registration information online. When you register with ABC, every effort will be made to maintain your information in a secure environment by ABC.  
  
If you wish to modify your registration information or stop receiving e-mail updates from ABC just send an email stating "please modify my registration" or "please unsubscribe me" to Webmaster@abc.com.  
  
About IP Addresses  
  
ABC collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.  
  
An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers -- the big computers that "serve" up Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address.  
  
When guests request pages from ABC sites, our servers log the guests' IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us.  
  
Use of Cookies -- The ABC Cookies Policy  
  
What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences while you're at our site. The use of cookies is an industry standard -- you'll find them at most major Web sites.  
  
By showing how and when guests use a site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. If you accept the first tracking cookie from ABC Web Sites, you won't be offered as many afterward.  
  
Examples of How ABC Sites Use Cookies  
  
A cookie lets the computers remember that you've registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities at our sites. Similarly, the ABC online store uses a temporary cookie to track which products you've chosen to purchase while shopping. The cookie expires once you're done shopping. Letting it do the record-keeping saves you the trouble of entering information over and over again during a single visit. If you decline this cookie, you may have difficulty ordering your selections.  
  
How ABC Sites Do Not Use Cookies  
  
ABC sites never use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except as described below, ABC sites do not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any third parties whatsoever.  
  
ABC sites do not use cookies to identify specific individuals, except in such cases as online shopping (see above) and contest registration (where a cookie allows you to enter a contest every day without registering again each time).  
  
You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. ABC does not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to the ABC cookies policy. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.  
  
Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the site, such as the shopping, contest, and game areas, will not function properly if you do so.  
  
Links to Other Sites  
  
Users should be aware that when they are on ABC sites they could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from ABC sites that take you outside our service. For example, if you click on a banner advertisement or an ABC search result, the click takes you off the ABC site. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use ABC 's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Always be aware of where you end up.  
  
Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online -- for example, via message boards or chat -- that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While ABC strives to protect its users' personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk.  
  
Security Policy  
  
The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our guests is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers, utilizing encryption software.  
  
Only those employees who need access to your information in order to do their jobs are allowed access, each having signed comprehensive nondisclosure agreements with ABC, which provide explicit legal confidentiality protections. Any employee who violates our privacy and/or security policies is subject to disciplinary action, including possible termination and civil and/or criminal prosecution.  
  
Your Acceptance of These Terms  
  
By using this site, you signify your assent to the ABC Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our sites. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of the ABC sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. You can send e-mail to us with any further questions by writing to [Webmaster@abc.com](mailto:Webmaster@abc.com)
