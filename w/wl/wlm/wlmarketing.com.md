# Privacy Policy and Terms of Service

We collect information from you when you register on our site or place an order.

When ordering or registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your: name, e-mail address or mailing address. You may, however, visit our site anonymously.

**What do we use your information for?**

• _To process transactions_

• _To send periodic emails_  
The email address you provide for order processing, will be used to send you information and updates pertaining to your order. We also have a periodic newsletter which you can opt out of through your Account Profile.

**Our Services**

With all submissions that we make to promote your website, we do our best to ensure that everything is optimized according to our past experiences and successes. Because each website is unique, though, absolute results cannot be guaranteed.

**Awaiting Client Action Orders And Credits**

From time to time, an order may be put in an 'awaiting client action' state either by you (when you 'hold' the order), or by a member of our staff if certain further information is required to process the order (non-working URL, etc.) 

We will give reminders on a regular basis for such orders. As resources must be allocated to support these orders, if orders are left in the 'awaiting client state' for 3 months without further action, they will be considered completed. 

Credits in the system may be set to expire if there has been no activity for 9 months.

**Ordering**

By ordering, you agree that the credit card or other payment method you are using belongs to you, or you have explicit permission to use it. In the event of a chargeback or dispute, you, the person placing the order and agreeing to this terms of service, has sole responsibility for the charges incurred.

We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
