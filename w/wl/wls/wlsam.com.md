# WLS, 890 AM - Chicago's Talk Station

Any person accessing this site agrees to the following:

Effective Date: March 9, 2006

This Privacy Policy is applicable to the WLS 890 AM website (www.wlsam.com) and any other website(s) on which WLS 890 AM (“WLS”) posts this Privacy Policy. WLS is referred to in this Privacy Policy as "we," "us," "our," and "ourselves."

When this Privacy Policy uses the term “personally identifiable information,” we mean information that identifies a particular individual, such as the individual’s first and last name, postal address, e-mail address, and telephone number. When other information, such as, for example, consumer product preferences or number of children, is directly associated with personally identifiable information, this other information also becomes personally identifiable information for purposes of this Privacy Policy. Personally identifiable information is sometimes referred to in this Privacy Policy as “personal information.” The terms of this Privacy Policy are subject to all applicable laws. 

We collect personally identifiable information during contests or sweepstakes, during registration for our website(s) that require subscription and in connection with interactive areas requiring registration. In addition, personal information is collected in certain portions of our website(s) in which visitors provide content submissions and suggestions or participate in interactive online activities (e.g., community postings, voting, chat, games, online shopping, surveys, applications for show tickets and bulletin boards). Typically, this information includes the visitor’s name, postal address, e-mail address, and telephone number. If you purchase products or services from us, we will retain for future use, for example, credit card information, the type of services or products ordered or purchased, and the date of the order or purchase. We may use such information to fulfill prizes and purchases, send you marketing and promotional information and offers, track compliance with our rules and terms and conditions, or for editorial and feedback purposes. In the event we plan to post any such information on a website, visitors are provided prior notification of such posting.

**Collection of Information from Children**

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from website visitors who are under the age of 13.

**Information Gathered Online**

Personal information submitted by visitors at the time of registration or submission may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by us and may be shared with our affiliated companies and third parties that have been prescreened by us. Personal information may be used by these affiliated companies and third parties to offer you promotions, products and services. In addition, regardless of any opt-out choices that a visitor makes (as described below), we may share a visitor’s personal information with third parties that facilitate communications and transactions with you on our behalf. These third parties may include, for example, companies that help either gather your information or communicate with you or help deliver products or services, like a shipping company that delivers a package or a company that helps fulfill prizes for a sweepstakes. Moreover, regardless of any opt-out choices that a visitor makes, we will disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that such disclosures (a) are necessary to comply with law, including, for example to respond to a court order or subpoena, or (b) will help to: enforce our Terms of Use; enforce contests, sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game rules; protect a visitor’s safety or security, including the safety and security of property that belongs to a visitor; and/or protect our safety and security and the safety and security of our website(s), our affiliated companies, and/or third parties, including the safety and security of property that belongs to us, our affiliated companies or third parties.

If a visitor objects to such marketing and promotional use by us or sharing with affiliated companies or third parties for any reason (subject to the exceptions described in the preceding paragraph), he/she may stop that use ( “opt-out”), either by e-mail request, or by modifying his/her WLS Insider contact information online. If an opt-out choice is not provided for such use by us or sharing with affiliated companies or third parties (subject to the exceptions described in the preceding paragraph), personal information collected from a visitor will not be used for such purposes. When you register with us, every effort will be made by us to maintain your information in a secure environment.

_Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information and Opt-Out Choices_

You can access and update your personally identifiable information or opt-out of certain uses by us of your personal information and/or certain sharing of your personal information with affiliated companies and/or third parties by clicking here: [http://www.wlsam.com/els/elsSignupFrm.asp?ALL=YES](https://web.archive.org/els/elsSignupFrm.asp?ALL=YES). In addition, if you wish to modify your personally identifiable information or stop receiving e-mail updates from us, you may send an email stating "please modify my registration" or "please unsubscribe me" to [webmaster@wlsam.com](mailto:webmaster@wlsam.com). When communicating with us by e-mail, please include the level of information in the e-mail that will help us identify you so we can assist you with your request. _About IP Addresses_

We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.

An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the web. Web servers -- the big computers that "serve" up web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address.

When visitors request pages from our website(s), our servers log the visitors' IP addresses. We normally do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a visitor's session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us. Nonetheless, we may use IP addresses to identify a visitor when we believe it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules or terms of service or use, to protect our service, website(s), customers or others, or to comply with law. 

**Use of Cookies -- Our Cookies Policy**

Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to a visitor's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences while you're at our website(s). The use of cookies is an industry standard -- you'll find them at most major websites.

By showing how and when visitors use various areas of a website, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the website are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. 

_\-- Examples of How We Use Cookies_

A cookie lets the computers remember that you've registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities at our website(s). Similarly, our online store may use a temporary cookie to track which products you've chosen to purchase while shopping. The cookie expires once you're done shopping. Letting it do the record-keeping saves you the trouble of entering information over and over again during a single visit. If you decline this cookie, you may have difficulty ordering your selections.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of our website(s), such as any shopping, contest, and game areas, will not function properly if you do so.

Advertisements may be managed and placed on our website(s) by third parties. These companies are called “network advertisers.” Network advertisers who place advertisements on our website(s) may also use cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information when you click on or move your cursor over one of their banner advertisements. You may not realize this information is being collected. In some cases, we may have access to information from web beacons and cookies used by network advertisers on our website(s) and this information may permit us to identify other websites that you have visited that are also associated with the network advertiser. Finally, once you’ve clicked on an advertisement and have left our website(s), our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal information will be handled on their website.

_\-- How We Do Not Use Cookies_

We never use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except as described below, we do not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any third parties whatsoever.

We do not use cookies to identify specific visitors, except in such cases as online shopping (see above), contest registration (where a cookie allows you to enter a contest every day without registering again each time), and for security purposes. 

_Links to Other Websites_

Visitors should be aware that when they are on our website(s) they could be directed to other websites that are beyond our control and not subject to this Privacy Policy. There are links to other websites from our website(s) that take you outside our service. For example, if you click on a banner advertisement or a search result on our website(s), the click takes you off that website. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use our logos as part of a co-branding agreement. These other websites may send their own cookies to visitors, collect data, or solicit personal information. Always be aware of where you end up.

Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online -- for example, via message boards or chat -- that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While we strive to protect our visitors' personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk.

_Security Policy_

The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our visitors is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers, utilizing encryption software, and we have implemented technical, administrative, and physical measures to protect visitor information from unauthorized access and improper use. Only those employees who need access to your information in order to do their jobs are allowed access, each being bound by comprehensive nondisclosure obligations. Any employee who violates our privacy and/or security policies is subject to disciplinary action, including possible termination and civil action and/or criminal prosecution. From time to time, we review new technology and methods. Please be aware though, that, despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.

_Amendments to this Privacy Policy_

We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time. If we amend this Privacy Policy to permit material changes in the way we collect, use and/or share your personal information, we will notify you of such changes by sending you an e-mail at the last e-mail address that you provided to us, and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our web site(s). Any such material changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective ten (10) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on our website(s). Any such material changes to this Privacy Policy may affect our use and sharing of personal information that you provided to us before our notification to you of the changes. If you do not wish to permit material changes in our collection, use or sharing of your personal information that you have provided to us before the effective date of such changes, you must so notify us before that effective date. Please be advised, however, that, regardless of whether you provide such notice to us, the changes to this Privacy Policy will apply to any personal information that you provide to us on or after the effective date of such changes.
