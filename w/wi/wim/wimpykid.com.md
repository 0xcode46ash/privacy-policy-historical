We are strongly committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information.  The policies below are applicable to the wimpykid.com website (“Website”) produced and maintained by Wimpy Kid, Inc. (collectively “Wimpy Kid” or “we”, “us”, or “our”).  We have established this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to let you know the kinds of personal information we may gather during your visit to the Website, why we gather your information, what we use your personal information for, when we might disclose your personal information, and how you can manage your personal information.

Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy apply only to information gathered online at our Website. It does not apply to information that you may submit to us offline, or to websites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we may link.

These additions may affect our Privacy Policy. Accordingly, we reserve the right to modify or amend the terms of our Privacy Policy from time to time without notice.  Such modifications and amendments shall be effective immediately upon their being posted to the Website. We recommend that you read this Privacy Policy each time you use our website.  However, we will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information we have previously collected without your express consent.  Your continued use of our Website following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.  If we intend to apply the modifications or amendments to this Privacy Policy retroactively, we will provide you with notice of the modifications or amendments.

### What Information About Me Is Collected and Stored?

Wimpy Kid adheres to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, the California Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003, and all other applicable laws and regulations, as well as to the highest standards of ethical practices in all of our operations. We are dedicated to protecting the privacy of all visitors to our Website.

### Personal Information

Wimpy Kid never automatically collects any personal information that specifically identifies Website users and does not condition or require anyone to share personal information to use the WimpyKid.com website.  Unless you provide comments to the website or submit information to Wimpy Kid, we do not collect any personally identifiable information from you.  If you are a person age 13 or older, and you submit comments or information, or send us e-mail, we may collect identifiable information about you that is included in such communications, such as your name and email address.  Such information is only kept for a period long enough to respond to your communication and is promptly deleted thereafter.

### Anonymous Information

When you interact with the Website, our servers may keep an activity log that does not identify you individually (“Anonymous Information”).

We use Anonymous Information to help us determine how people use parts of the Website and who our users are so we can improve our Website and ensure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many people as possible.  We also use Anonymous Information to provide statistical “ratings” information in aggregated form to our partners and other third parties about how our users collectively use the Website. We may also use or share Anonymous Information (or other information, other than Personal Information) in any other manner that we deem appropriate or necessary.

### Use of Cookies and Spyware

We may also use cookies to monitor traffic, improve the Website and make it easier and/or relevant for your use.  You may occasionally get cookies from companies advertising on our behalf.  We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to this cookie policy.  You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies.
