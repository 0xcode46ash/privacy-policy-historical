The protection of your personal data is very important to us. As far as we collect, process or use ("use"), personal information about you as part of the services provided, this is done so under the relevant German and European data protection laws. We use personal information you actively provide us (e.g. at registration, while making an offer or username, etc.) for the implementation of our services.   
We use "persistent" cookies. They remain on the user's computer to simplify personalization and registration services the next time our site is visited. Cookies can store for example, what the user has selected. The user can always manually remove "persistent" cookies.   
We also use "session" cookies. These do not stay on the user's computer. Once the user leaves the site, this temporary cookie is deleted. Using the information gathered, we can analyze usage patterns and structures of the site. In this way we can improve our services further and further, such as by improving content, personalization and making the site easier to use.   
By means of a so-called "tracking tool" on the website, data is collected and stored for marketing and optimization purposes. An anonymous user profile is created with the saved data. The user can object to the data collection and storage at any time in the future.   
Without the express consent of the user, we will not use the tracking tools to secretly collect personal data about the user, and to forward such data to third parties and marketing platforms, or to link the data with personal data (name, address, etc.).
