# The International Film Festival Submission Service (BrigitFest)

**PRIVACY POLICY** _Updated August 20, 2001  
_

At Without A Box, we value our customers' privacy as we would our own. This privacy policy was developed to provide you with assurance that we won’t use your data in ways that we would object to other web sites using our information. The bottom line is that we keep the information you provide to us safe and confidential and release this information only at your specific request. Please keep reading to see our entire policy. It is important to us that you understand it. 

Here are some of the things we don’t like:We don’t like receiving e-mail "spam" or "junk mail;"We don’t like our name, e-mail address or any other personal information being given to any third party without our specific approval;We don’t like being contacted by site sponsors without our permission.

Since we don’t like those things, we assume you don't like them either.

Our privacy policy covers three separate categories:The privacy of Filmmakers/Festival Submitters as it relates to their film information and their personal information;The privacy of Festivals, as it relates to their internal processes and their Administrators and Staffs;General privacy and security practices covering all interactions at Withoutabox, including and beyond the scope of the festival submission process.

**CATEGORY 1** : Filmmakers and Film Submitters

We will not release your film submission information to any festival unless you specifically apply to that festival. By applying to a festival, you give that festival permission to view all of the information you have provided to us on the master entry form. You also give that festival permission to share your information with whomever that festival would normally share film submission information. Without A Box does not control how a festival uses or discloses the information you authorize us to provide to it. If you are concerned, you should check with the festival to determine how it intends to use your information.

We do not disclose the list of festivals to which you apply to anyone but you. We keep this information confidential whether your film is accepted or rejected. Thus, nobody will know which festivals your films were submitted to unless one of the following occurs:You tell them;The festival makes its selections public, (which public information may also become available on our site). Most festivals only make acceptances public, and do not post rejections.

**CATEGORY 2** : Festivals, their Administrators and Staffs

We do not use or disclose the lists of filmmakers who applied to your festival or have been accepted or rejected by your festival unless you make those lists public. No one except those authorized by your festival "back office administrator" will have access to your Without A Box account and the information stored there. Our employees have access to your information on an as needed basis only for customer support, technical support, and to otherwise fulfill our service agreement with you.

**CATEGORY 3** : General Use and Security

From time to time, we may offer you additional services or opportunities, which may require the transfer of all or some of your information to other areas of our site. We do not assume that you are interested in enrolling in any new service or assume your consent to share any details regarding your personal information. We only do this with your express permission. We will not "hide" a permission in the middle of other questions to trick you into giving us your authority. We will present matters concerning your privacy and the integrity of your data openly and in their appropriate contexts. We will require you to actively choose to "opt in" or "opt out."

Our employees will have access to your information on an as needed basis, such as for customer support, technical support, and to otherwise fulfill our service agreement with you. We reserve the right to send you "internal messages," "instant messages," or e-mails about customer support, technical support, updates, your account in general, or any other correspondence we determine is constructive to our community or to you as our customer. However, since it is our desire for you to enjoy an "uncluttered" experience at Without A Box, we will be extremely selective in contacting you.

If Without A Box were to become owned, in whole or in part, by a third party, that third party may also determine to contact Without A Box users for the purposes of offering their other products or for informational purposes. You would be notified in advance of any such relationship and its potential effects upon this policy.

In all other cases, your personal information will not be shared with third parties unless you give that third party "opt-in" permission to contact you, either through the Without A Box web site, or independently.

Without A Box has technological and operational security procedures in place to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, alteration or unintentional destruction. Our personnel who have access to the data understand the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of such information. They are also contractually obligated to do so. We keep track of who in the company is logged on and working in the system at any given time.

At some places in the site, we use "cookies" to enhance your online experience. Cookies allow our database to recognize any information associated with one of your films or your film festival, and they allow you to navigate through our site easily. All our cookies expire when you close your system. This is done so that you must login each time you enter withoutabox.com's secure areas. Most browsers now recognize when a "cookie" is offered, and permit you to refuse or accept it. Our system will not work if you turn your cookies off. They must be on.

Personal information collected by Without A Box is stored and maintained in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. Without A Box does not sell or disclose personal member information to anyone. We may aggregate information into demographic data and make it available to other sites or advertisers. However, this information will not identify you personally. When you provide us with personal information, you are sharing that information with Without A Box alone unless you decide to submit that information to a film festival or opt-in to a Without A Box sponsor promotion.

We do not share personal information with any third parties unless we believe that such action is necessary to conform to legal requirements, protect the rights of Without A Box, or enforce the Without A Box Terms of Service. Please be aware that our web sites have advertisements that are links to the web sites of our advertisers . If you click on these links you are leaving our website. While we do not share any personal information about you when you click on these links, once you leave the Without A Box environment for a partner's site, whether festival partner or corporate sponsor, the privacy policy of the partner site may be different from Without A Box’s Privacy Policy.

In order to participate in Without A Box’s Cache+ program, you may have to share additional information with third parties. If you choose to not provide this information, which may be subject to the privacy policies of others, then you may not be able to participate in certain aspects of the Without A Box Cache+ Program.

If your computer is available to others, you should remember to logout and close your browser window when you have finished your work to ensure that others cannot access your personal information.

We recognize our responsibility to protect the privacy of your personal information. If you have questions or comments about the administration of your personal information, please contact us at privacy@withoutabox.com. You may also use this address to communicate any concerns you may have regarding compliance with our Privacy Policy.

We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy to adapt to our changing business, technological innovations, and the needs and expectations of our users. If we change our Policy, these changes will be posted here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we disclose it to anyone. If we make any material change concerning how your personal information is used or disclosed, then, in addition to including such revision in this Privacy Policy, we will post a notice on the Without A Box site that such changes to the Privacy Policy are going into effect and send you an email notification summarizing the changes. If you are dissatisfied with any changes in our Policy, you will have a reasonable opportunity to object. You are expected to review this Agreement periodically to ensure familiarity with the most current version.
