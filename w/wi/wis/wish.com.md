Gift Logic has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: wish.com.

Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart, and to gather broad demographic information. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests.

Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and e-mail address) but does not require any sort of demographic information (such as zip code or income level). We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user promotional material from some of our partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Some demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. The data collected includes, but is not limited to: interests, hobbies, favorite colors, clothing sizes, or any other information that may be pertinent personal information to shopping for gifts and making purchases. This data is optional, of course, and can be accessed within the profile section of the individual's wish.com registry.

This site contains links to third party web sites to facilitate e-commerce transactions between buyers and sellers. wish.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of third party Web sites, and as such, wish.com MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE PRIVACY PRACTICES OR THE CONTENT, AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. All consequences resulting from linking to and entering into business relations with third party or for any claims related to the third party's sale or offer to sell goods are not the responsibility of GiftLogic.com. wish.com is a true infomediary and allows access to other associate merchant sites for registering of gifts with wish.com, or to purchase items via that particular merchant. AS SUCH, ANY AND ALL ISSUES RELATED TO PAYMENT, SHIPPING OR RECEIVING OF MERCHANDISE, SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO THE MERCHANT, AND NOT TO wish.COM.

Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like their e-mail address) and some demographic information, such as age. We use contact data from our surveys to send the user promotional material via e-mail from some of our partners, at the user's request. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. The data collected may include interests, hobbies, favorite colors, clothing sizes, or any other information that may be pertinent personal information to shopping for gifts and making purchases. This data is optional, of course, and can be accessed within the profile section of the individual's wish.com registry.

We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like their e-mail address) and demographic information (like their age). The customer's contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see our choice/opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. Besides the profile for each user's gift registry, we also collect data for the gift reminder, gift surprise, event planning, on-sale, as well as other wish.com e-mail notifications.

  
  
This site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.   
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. You can be assured that your personal email address and other such personal profile information will ONLY be available to those whom you deem accessible to your gift registry via a special "guest password". Our website is hosted and secured physically at Level 3\. Access to this location is restricted by advanced technology such as palm scanning, cameras and access badge. wish.com's site is hosted on a secure server with advanced encryption techniques; all sensitive data is stored behind a firewall. Machine access is restricted to encrypted connections and is password protected.   
Children's safety on the Internet is a very important issue for wish.com. Children should always ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to anyone online. When children under age 13 visit wish.com, we ask them to have a parent or guardian's permission before creating a gift registry or shopping for any gift items. wish.com does not share personal information about users under the age of 13 with third parties and we do not sell or rent personal information about any of our users, regardless of age. In addition, wish.com will not send any direct email offers to users who indicate they are under the age of 13.   
Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us, and our partners at the point where we request information about the visitor.
