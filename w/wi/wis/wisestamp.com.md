### Web Site Visits & Statistical information

Like most Web sites on the Internet, the WiseStamp server records certain information it automatically receives from the browser, such as the Web request, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, language preference, referring site, pages viewed and the order of those pages. This information is used to help diagnose problems with our servers, to make the site more useful and to customize the site and personalize its content for you.

By analyzing the Web site usage as explained above, we may compile certain statistical information, such as most visited WiseStamp pages. This aggregated statistical data cannot be not linked to any personal information. We may share such non-personal statistical information with our partners.

### Third Party Web Sites

We may display links to 3rd party sites and some of our site pages might display information from 3rd parties (such as YouTube or Flickr). We cannot be held responsible for any 3rd party Web sites and accessing their content will be subject to their own privacy policies, which we advise you to check.
