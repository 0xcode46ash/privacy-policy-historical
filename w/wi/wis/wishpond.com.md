Your privacy is important to Wishpond Technologies Ltd. (“Wishpond”). This privacy policy (“Policy”) applies to the Wishpond Web sites (“Sites”). This Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by Wishpond.

In addition, we may collect personal information from you as a user of our Applications. Information we may collect includes name and email address, and phone number.

In addition, when you visit our Sites some information may be automatically collected. For example, it is standard for your Web browser to automatically send information to every Web site you visit including ours. That information includes your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, browser type and language, and referring Web site addresses. We may also collect information about your computer’s operating system and information about your usage and activity on our Sites. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user-base as a whole.

**Cookies**

We use third parties such as a credit card processing company to bill you for services, an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf, a company to provide our forums and an employment resources company to process your job applications. When you sign up for our services, we will share the personal information you provide only as necessary for the third party to provide that service.

Unless you opt for our white label campaign option or you are a Qualified Partner, Wishpond will co-own data that may include your name, email address, phone number and birth date. If we co-own your personal data all campaign entry forms will have a Wishpond mailing list Opt-In. We may use aggregate data collected for internal analysis purposes.

We do not share your personal information with third parties other than as described above and as follows:

  * with third party vendors, consultants and other service providers (“Service Providers”) who are working on our behalf and need access to your information to carry out their work for us;
  * to (a) comply with laws or respond to lawful requests and legal process, (b) to protect the rights and property of Wishpond, our agents, members, and others including to enforce our agreements, policies and terms of use, or (c) in the good faith belief that disclosure is needed to respond to an emergency or protect the personal safety of any person; and
  * in connection with any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company. In any such event, we will provide notice if your data is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
