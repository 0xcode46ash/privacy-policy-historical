**PRIVACY POLICY**

**INFORMATION COLLECTION**  
We do not collect personally identifiable information about you except when you specifically provide this information on a voluntary basis. We will make every effort to ensure that whatever information you provide will be maintained in a secure environment. 

However, even if you opt out of receiving any communications from wisfootball.net, we reserve the right to contact you regarding your account status or any other matter that might affect our service to you and/or our records on you. 

**INFORMATION USE**  
The Wisconsin Sports Network (WSN) reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics. We do this in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the web site. WSN collects IP addresses for system administration and record keeping. Your IP address is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the World Wide Web. Our servers record incoming IP addresses. The IP addresses are analyzed only in aggregate; no connection is made between you and your computer's IP address. By tracking IP addresses, we can determine which sites refer the most people to wisfootball.net (Think of an IP address like your zip code; it tells us in general terms where you're from.) 

**COOKIES**  
"Cookies" are small text files a web site can use to recognize repeat users. WSN uses cookies to recognize visitors and more quickly provide personalized content or grant you unimpeded access to the web site. With cookies enabled, you will not need to fill in password or contact information. Information gathered through cookies also helps us measure use of our web site. Cookie data allow us to track usage behavior and compile data that we can use to improve the site. This data will be used in aggregate form; no specific users will be tracked. 

Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside of the Web site that he or she is visiting. You can easily turn off cookies. Most browsers have a feature that allows the user to refuse cookies or issues a warning when cookies are being sent. However, our site will not function properly without cookies. Enabling cookies ensures a smooth, efficient visit to our web site. 

**OPTING OUT**  
Upon your request, WSN will delete you and your personal information from our database; however, it may be impossible to delete all of your information without some residual data because of backups and records of deletions. 

**GENERAL SECURITY POLICY**  
WSN is aware of your privacy concerns and strives to collect only as much data as is required to make your WSN experience as efficient and satisfying as possible, in the most unobtrusive manner as possible. The foregoing policies are effective as of October 2002. WSN reserves the right to change this policy at any time by notifying users of the existence of a new privacy statement. This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.
