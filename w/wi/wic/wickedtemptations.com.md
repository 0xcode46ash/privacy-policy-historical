## How To Use Our On-Line Shopping Cart

In an effort to make our site as fast as possible, we've made it so you can browse thumbnail size photos. When you find something you like, simply click on the thumbnail to see a larger photo along with price, color and size information. In most cases, you'll even find suggested matching items and accessories.

To purchase an item, select the color and size your want by clicking on the drop-down boxes provided. Then, click on the shopping cart icon on the same line. You will be taken to a page that details the items in your cart.

The first thing you'll see at the top of the shopping cart page is the list of shipping options. Make sure you select the correct option for your circumstance. The shipping option you select will depend only on the location of the ship-to address. For more information about shipping, please see: [How We Ship](http://www.wickedtemptations.com/www-wickedtemptations-com/faq.chk#show) and [Express Shipping](http://www.wickedtemptations.com/www-wickedtemptations-com/faq.chk#show)

To remove an item from your shopping cart, put the number 0 in the quantity box and click on the "update quantity" button.

To add more items to your shopping cart, simply hit the browser's back button and shop some more.

The shopping cart software automatically totals up your order and adds in the appropriate shipping charges and sales tax (if you are shipping to a California address). When you are happy with the contents of your cart and are ready to submit your order, please go to: [How To Place Your Order With Us](http://www.wickedtemptations.com/www-wickedtemptations-com/faq.chk#oplace) for the next step.

## How To Place Your Order With Us

There are several ways to transmit an order to us:  

* Using the shopping cart
  

* Snail Mail (Postal Service)
  

* Telephone
* E-Mail
* Fax

Regardless of the method of transmission, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS USE THE SHOPPING CART TO PUT YOUR ORDER TOGETHER. Once you're happy with the composition of your order, you can then choose the check-out method that works out best for you.

**IF YOU WANT THE SHOPPING CART SOFTWARE TO FORWARD YOUR ORDER/PAYMENT INFORMATION:**  
Just select "On-Line Check-Out for New Customer" or "On-Line Check-out for Previous Customer". If you have never placed an order with us, you'll be asked to fill in a form with your mailing and shipping addresses. At the end of the form you'll be asked for a password. This password can be any 4+ character combination that you want. _(The next time you place an order, you'll be able to select the check-out option for previous customers. You'll be asked for your name and password. The server will then retrieve the address information you provided the first time.)_

Next, you'll be asked for credit card information. Since this is a secure server, you can feel confident of the safety of this information. After the order is processed, the credit card information is deleted from the server and the only information retained is your name/address/password.

After typing in your credit card number and expiration date, you just need to hit the submit button. Just do this once - sometimes it takes a little time for the information to be transmitted to the secure server.

You will receive a confirmation email within minutes. Keep this email in case you have any questions. If you discover you made a mistake in specifying your order or payment/address information, just send us an email with the clarification... please don't resubmit your order (that always looks a bit confusing to us).

**IF YOU WANT TO FAX, SNAIL-MAIL OR PHONE YOUR ORDER TO US:**  
Just select the "Off-Line Checkout (phone,fax,mail" option. Your order will be presented on your screen in a clear format. Hit your print icon on your browser and a nice copy of your order will be produced. Use that copy when e-mailing, snail-mailing or phoning us.

## International Customers: How To Place An Order

You can place your order the same way US customers do, except the toll free number only works in the US and Canada.

## International Customers: How We Ship

To save you money, we ship via the US Postal Service-Airmail. Although other companies, such as UPS and Federal Express, do a fine job, they are not very cost competative.

Our experience is that most international customers receive their shipments within a one to two week time frame.

## All About Our Printed Catalog

We include a copy of our 40 page printed catalog with every order. This catalog is updated and mailed twice a year to customers who have either subscribed to the catalog or have made a purchase in the last two years.

All of the items in the printed catalog are included in this web site. The catalog, however, only includes about 20% of the items you'll find on this page. Despite the smaller selection, we still get numerous requests for the printed catalog from those who do not have consistant access to the net and from those who prefer to have something in their hands to page thru. The fee for a subscription is $4.00. This will put you on our mailing list for two years (or more if you make a purchase during your subscription period). You will also receive a $4.00 off coupon with your catalog - so if you make a purchase, your subscription is free. To order a catalog please click on the shopping cart below 

(and don't forget - **if you place an order, you automatically receive a catalog - you do not have to request it)**.
