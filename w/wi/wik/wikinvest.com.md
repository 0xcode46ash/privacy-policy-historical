##  Wikinvest Privacy Policy 

###  Introduction/Summary 

Wikinvest ("we" or "us") is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This Privacy Statement sets out our privacy policy and explains what we do with the personal information that we collect from you. Please read the following to understand our practices regarding personal information and how they affect you as you use our features and services. This statement discloses our current privacy practices; if we make material changes to these practices, we will post them them. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact us at privacy at wikinvest dot com. 

###  Information Collected by Us 

We collect user submitted account information such as name and email address to identify you and send you notifications related to the use of the service. We maintain information you submit in your profile on the site, and we also collect user submitted content about companies and investing and other information. Some information collected is not explicitly submitted by the user. Examples of such information include (but are not limited to): browser-type related information, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, and timestamp. 

###  How We Use Your Information 

Information such as your full name, profile photo and any personally identifiable information you have included in your profile may be shown to users, primarily in conjunction with articles you have contributed to. Your full name and email address may also be used when you send an email notification to another user on our site. We may also use your email address to send you communications from us or messages that we send you on behalf of other users, but you may opt out of receiving emails by changing your email preferences in your account settings. 

Browser-type related information, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, timestamp data, and other information help us diagnose problems with our server, administer Wikinvest, and otherwise provide the highest possible level of service to you. In addition, we use this information to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site. 

###  Use of Cookies and IP Addresses 

Like most websites, Wikinvest requires cookies to function properly. Cookies are small text files that reside on a user's computer and identify you as a unique user. We use cookies to refine our site and simplify the user experience. For example, the use of cookies allows registered users to enter our site without explicitly typing in their email address and password every time, and it allows us to personalize your experience on the site by suggesting articles you may be interested in. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, you should note that cookies may be necessary to provide you certain features (e.g., customized delivery of information) available on the Wikinvest site.] 

###  Transfer/Disclosure of Information 

Most of the information you provide on our site is publicly exposed. However, except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information. We will disclose information about individual users to governmental or judicial authorities or law enforcement agencies, or to other individuals or entities in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes. Further, we may share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud, or to enforce or apply the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. 

We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer of ownership of Wikinvest, such as an acquisition by or merger with another company. In such an event, we will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 

We will notify you when information about you may be provided to third parties in ways other than explained above, and you will have the option to prevent such information sharing. 

###  Security 

Your Wikinvest account is password-protected. We try very hard to protect our users' information. If you have any questions about the security at our website, please contact us. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. 

_You hereby acknowledge that we are not responsible for any intercepted information sent via the Internet, and you hereby release us from any and all claims arising out of or related to the use of intercepted information in any unauthorized manner._

###  Email/Direct Mail and Opt-out 

Registered members can opt-out of personal messages initiated by users and/or opt-out of receiving notifications initiated by us. Unregistered users that do not wish to receive emails may opt-out of receiving any communications by following the instructions contained in all emails. However, at this time it is not possible for users to opt-out of receiving articles sent to them by other users through using the sharing features of our website. 

###  Controlling Your Personal Information 

You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) via reviews, messages, forums, postings, or in other areas of the Wikinvest site, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in your communication, can be collected and correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Wikinvest. Please do not post any personal information on the Wikinvest site or in other areas that you expect to keep private. 

As a registered Wikinvest user, you can modify your personal information at any time by accessing your profile by clicking on your username in the account section of the shelf. 

###  Respecting Children’s Privacy 

This website is not directed to children, and we do not knowingly solicit information from any child under the age of 13. Should a child whom we know to be under 13 send personal information to us, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child (or a parent or guardian) to inform him or her that we must have parental consent before receiving his or her personal information. 

###  Links 

Our website may contain links to third party websites to which we have no affiliation. We do not share your personal information with those websites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. We suggest you read the privacy polices on these third party websites. 

###  Modification to the Privacy Policy 

By using the website, you signify your agreement to the terms of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, you should not use the site. We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If a material change is made to this Privacy Policy and/or the way we use our users’ personally identifiable information, then we will post a prominent notice of the nature of such change on the first page of this Privacy Policy. You are responsible for reviewing this Privacy Policy periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes to it. Your continued use of the site indicates your assent to any changes to this Privacy Policy.
