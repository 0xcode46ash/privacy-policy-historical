# Privacy policy | WikiJob

WikiJob is commited to protecting your privacy in accordance with the law. This privacy policy explains what information we collect about users of the WikiJob website (the "Website") and how we will use it.

Please note that the Website contains links to other website which are outside our control and which are not covered by this privacy policy. Operators of such websites may collect information from you which may be used in a manner inconsistent with the WikiJob privacy policy.

## The information we collect

When you register to use the Website bulletin boards or subscribe to the email update system we need to know your name and email address. We (or our agents or subcontractors) may check some of the information that you provide to us against third party databases to confirm that it is accurate.

The Website uses "cookies" (small pieces of information stored on your computer's hard drive by your browser) which enable us to personalise your use of the Website (for example by automatically filling in your password for the bulletin boards). Most browsers allow users to turn off the cookie function - this will not prevent you from using the Website. 

## How we may use such information

We gather this information to allow us to operate the email update system, to personalise your use of the Website, to enable us to contact you in the event of queries relating to the bulletin boards and for security reasons. We may also use the information to communicate with you on any matter relating to the provision of the WikiJob service in general.

On occasions we carry out surveys or other promotional activities which may be for our own benefit or for more general interest. Participation in any survey is entirely optional. We will store any information you provide and reserve the right to use it or distribute it to third parties as we wish.

We may analyse user data to decide which users to include in any promotional campaigns we may run. We may also use aggregate information and statistics for the purposes of monitoring Website usage in order to help us develop the Website and our service and may provide such aggregate information to third parties.

From time to time we may provide your information to our customer service agencies for research and analysis purposes so that we can monitor and improve the services we provide. We or our agents and sub-contractors may occasionally contact you including by post, email or telephone to ask you for your feedback and comments on our services.

We take reasonable precautions to ensure that any personal information which you provide is used only for the express purposes set out in these conditions. However, the internet is not a completely secure network and we cannot guarantee that such information will not be intercepted by other parties.

We (and any group companies) may also wish to provide you with information about special features of our web site or any special service or products which we think may be of interest to you. If you would rather not receive this information, please contact us.

We may also want to provide you with related information from third parties which we think may be of interest to you. If you would rather not receive this information, please contact us.

## Your consent

By submitting your information you consent to the use of that information as set out in this policy. If we change our privacy policy we will post the changes on this page, and may place notices on other pages of the web site, so that you may be aware of the information we collect and how we use it. We will also e-mail you should we make any changes so that you may consent to our use of your information in that way. Continued use of the service will signify that you agree to any such changes.

Because the internet infrastructure is global, the information you provide may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") that do not have similar data protection legislation during use as set out in this policy (for example, we may decide at a later date to host the WikiJob site on servers located outside the EEA). However, we have taken the steps outlined above to try to improve the security of your information. Should we wish to transfer data for processing to a country outside the EEA we will ensure that suitable arrangements are in place to protect your privacy. By submitting your information you consent to these transfers.
