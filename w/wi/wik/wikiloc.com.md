##### 4\. USE OF COOKIES AND IP ADDRESSES OF WEBSITE USERS

The Website uses cookies to facilitate and customize user navigation through the Website.

In operating this Website, Wikiloc may use cookies. A cookie is a piece of information that the computer or computers that host the Webite give to the user’s browser when accessing the Website. Wikiloc cookies help provide additional functionality to the Website and help Wikiloc analyze the Website usage more accurately. For instance, the Website may set a cookie on the user’s browser that keeps him or her from needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Website. On most web browsers, users will find a "help" section on the toolbar. Wikiloc refers to this section for information on how to receive notification when receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. Wikiloc recommends that users leave cookies turned on because they allow users to take advantage of some of the Website’s features.

Even though Wikiloc does not and will not perform any attempt to associate the IP address with specific individuals, accessing IP addresses could be regarded as a processing of personal data, given the possibility to identify the individual to which an IP address is associated (more a theoretical than an actual possibility), so according to the applicable data protection law, this Privacy Policy will apply.

Third parties advertising in the Website could use cookies or ‘web beacons’ of which Wikiloc would not be responsible and which would not be governed by this Privacy Policy, so it is the responsibility of the user to set the options in his/her browser so cookies are only used according to his own preferences.
