This Privacy Policy deals with the processing of Website and Applications users’ personal data by Wikiloc as part of the services provided through the Website and the Applications (" **Services** "). 

By accessing and using the Website, it is understood that the user has read and agreed to the terms of this Privacy Policy. The date at the beginning of this Privacy Policy refers to the latest update of this Privacy Policy, which will be applicable from the date of publication.

Some of the Services provided through the Website may be subject to specific privacy policies that will complement or, if in conflict with this Privacy Policy, supersede the terms of this Privacy Policy. The user will accept any specific privacy policies that may apply before the provision of such service commences. 

Additionally, access and use of the Website, and download and use of the Applications and Services are subject to the Terms of Use. 

##  1\. PERSONAL DATA FILES, PURPOSES OF THE PROCESSING AND TYPES OF PERSONAL DATA 

User data collected through the Services is stored in a personal data file named "WIKILOC USERS", registered at the General Data Protection Register for which Wikiloc is the data controller. Following the user’s request for any Services that require geo-location, such as the recording of tracks or waypoints or navigate downloaded tracks, the provision of such Services may include the processing of user’s location data for the purposes set forth below and for allowing or improving the provision of the Services. The purpose of this personal data file is the management of the Website and the Applications and the provision of the Services, and to send emails regarding Wikiloc’s services and user’s trails as requested by the user, including adapting the content which is accessed by the user. Subscription to these emails can be cancelled at any time by accessing the section "Your settings page". 

Personal data that can be collected at the time of registration or afterwards, are the following: 

  * Nickname (mandatory). 
  * Password (mandatory). 
  * Email address (mandatory). 
  * Home page or weblog. 
  * About user (description). 
  * Photo. 
  * Activities of interest. 
  * User’s location. 
  * Units of measure. 



Wikiloc does not collect the age or the date of birth of its users. Accordingly, there is no specific processing of minor’s personal data. Wikiloc is only addressed to adults. 

Additionally, users may upload their trails through the Services, including geographical information, date, means of transport, trail duration, difficulty level, pictures taken, videos recorded and any comments they deem appropriate. Users may also identify their favorite trails, and keep track of other users’ activities. 

##  2\. COMMUNICATION OF PERSONAL DATA 

The way the Services work implies that part of the information provided by the users will be available to other Website users through the Website or the Applications. Such other users with access to that information could be located anywhere in the world. Users should refrain from providing information during the registration process which they do not want to make available to other users. Providing such additional information is not a requirement for using the Services. Users may, at any time, modify or delete this information (except for the nickname and email address) by accessing to "Your settings page". However, Wikiloc will not publish users email unless they mark it as "public" during the registration process or afterwards. 

Additionally, users can mark the trails that they upload to the Services as "public" or "private". By default, trails are marked as public and are available to other users. During the uploading process or at any time afterwards users will be able to modify this attribute for each of their trails by editing the trail properties. 

Any user publishing within the Website or the Applications personal information of third parties guarantees that he/she has previously obtained such third parties’ consent. 

Public trails and certain information related to them are shared with Google Inc. and Google group companies, and may be displayed through the Google Earth viewer. Wikiloc does not assume any liability in relation to the processing of users’ personal data by Google. 

Wikiloc also offers users the possibility to show their trails on Facebook. In order to do this, Wikiloc and Facebook must share user’s personal data. Wikiloc does not assume any liability in relation to the processing of user’s personal data by Facebook. 

Wikiloc runs a forum in which users request help or make suggestions. Personal data provided by the users in this forum is subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy, and is available to other users of the forum. 

##  3\. EXERCISE OF THE RIGHTS OF ACCESS, RECTIFICATION, CANCELATION AND OBJECTION. 

Wikiloc guarantees the exercise of the rights of access, rectification, cancelation and right to objection that Constitutional Law 15/1999 grants data subjects before the data controllers. As provided above, users may access and modify their information directly in "Your settings page". 

Any data subject who intends to exercise any such rights in connection with personal data processed by Wikiloc should contact Wikiloc at the address of the data controller included in this Privacy Policy or the following email address: [info@wikiloc.com](mailto:info@wikiloc.com), including in the subject a clear reference to the right he/she intends to exercise and addressing the email to the attention of Wikiloc’s governing body. 

Pursuant to Royal Decree 1720/2007 the exercise of rights shall be made in accordance with the procedure below. 

The communication shall be addressed to the data controller and shall include: 

  1. First and second names of the data subject; a copy of his/her identity card, passport or any other valid document which identifies him/her or, if applicable, of the person representing him/her (in this latter case evidence of the authority to represent the data subject); 
  2. Details of the request being made; 
  3. address where notifications may be served to the data subject, date and signature; 
  4. supporting documentation for the request being made, if any.

If the request does not comply with the requirements above, Wikiloc shall request the data subject to provide the necessary additional information. 

The following provisions will apply depending on Wikiloc’s collection of certain types of personal data: 

##  4\. USE OF COOKIES AND USER’S IP ADDRESSES 

The Website uses cookies to facilitate and customize user navigation through the Website. 

In operating this Website, Wikiloc may use cookies. A cookie is a piece of information that the computer or computers that host the Webite give to the user’s browser when accessing the Website. Wikiloc cookies help provide additional functionality to the Website and help Wikiloc analyze the Website usage more accurately. For instance, the Website may set a cookie on the user’s browser that prevents the user from having to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Website. On most web browsers, users will find a "help" section on the toolbar. Wikiloc refers to this section for information on how to receive notification when receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. Wikiloc informs users that allowing the use of cookies by their browser will permit users to take advantage of some of the Website’s features. 

Wikiloc does not use cookies with advertising purposes, nor to associate browsing data with individuals that have not been previously identified. 

This Website also has access to the IP address with which each user accesses the Website (including any access from the Applications). The IP address with which each user accesses the Website may be different each time. Additionally, different users can share a single IP address. 

Even though Wikiloc does not and will not attempt to associate the IP address with specific individuals, accessing IP addresses could be regarded as a processing of personal data given the possibility to identify the individual to which an IP address is associated (more a theoretical than an actual possibility). Consequently, according to the applicable data protection law, this Privacy Policy will apply. 

Third parties advertising on the Website could use cookies or ‘web beacons’ for which Wikiloc would not be responsible and which would not be governed by this Privacy Policy, so it is the responsibility of the user to set the options in his/her browser in order that cookies are only used according to his/her own preferences.
