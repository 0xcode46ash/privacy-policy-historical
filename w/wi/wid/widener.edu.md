_Browser cookies_ are small pieces of data placed on your computer as you navigate websites with your browser.  Browser cookies allow websites and various third-parties to distinguish your device from others by having the cookie consist of a unique identifier or other data.  Cookies can have many uses, such as to target advertising, as well as to enable website functionality and for security.  We use both session cookies (which expire after you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). Persistent cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable cookies, some areas of our website may not work properly.

Information is transmitted from your browser and may include an identifier assigned by the social network or third party, information about your browser type, operating system, device type, IP address, and the URL of the web page where widget appears. If you use social network tools or visit social networking sites, you should read their privacy disclosures, to learn what information they collect, use, and share. 

**HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?  **

We limit the collection of Personal Information to that which is required in order to provide services to you.  We collect personal information in order to deliver and better tailor the features, performance and support of our services and Website, and to offer you additional information about our services, personalized to you, your role, and interests at Widener.  Uses of some common categories of information are described below. 

**Use of the Widener ID Number**

The Widener ID Number is used as the student identification number and, for faculty and staff, as an administrative system identifier.

Social security numbers are used for payroll and tax benefit information for students and employees, and for those students who apply for financial aid.  We are required by law to collect SSNs from: 

  * students;
  * those who are employed by and/or paid by the University;
  * individuals applying for or receiving financial aid



**Use of Contact Information for Emergency/Crisis Notification**

Any and all contact information you provide, such as home telephone numbers, cellular numbers, and email addresses may be used to notify you of an emergency or crisis that may affect you and/or the University community.

**HOW DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION?**

Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Statement, we do not sell, rent, or share your Personal Information with third parties.  We may disclose your Personal Information to:

  * third parties involved in assisting the University in providing services, including but not limited to employee background checks, administrative services, and technical services; 
  * local, state and/or Federal agencies, pursuant to valid legal process; and
  * other parties as we deem reasonably necessary in order to protect and defend our rights, or the rights or safety of third parties



**How Personal Information is Shared Within Widener**

We use your Personal Information primarily to enable delivery, personalization, and improvement of services at Widener.  Personal Information may be shared with other departments and business units at the University to the extent necessary to deliver and improve services offered or to satisfy local, state and federal laws and regulations. 

**How Personal Information is Shared Outside Widener**

We may share your Personal Information with others outside of the University, such as third-party providers, vendors, and others acting on behalf of the University, for a variety of purposes, for example, to the extent necessary to deliver,  improve and tailor services to you. Third parties who receive Personal Information are generally contractually prohibited from using or sharing Personal Information for any purpose other than providing services to users.  Widener does not sell Personal Information to third-party data brokers. The University may share Personal Information pursuant to valid legal process, to detect, prevent or investigate fraud or system or network security issues, or to protect the safety or rights of the university and other third parties. 

**Sharing Cookies and Technical Information with Third Parties**

The University has relationships with authorized third-party providers whose services are accessed through the Campus Cruiser portal or other webservices. In order to facilitate your access to these services, the University may automatically send one or more of your cookies to the third-party site or service so that you may access third-party services without re-entering your Widener user ID and password, or other required information, each time. 

We use the information we get from web analytics tools such as Google Analytics to improve the user experience or our website. These tools collect data such as browser information, operating system, and page views through the implementation of session cookies or persistent cookies. Each tool creates a persistent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user. The cookie is only used by Widener University and/or the software publisher of the respective tool. The software publisher’s ability to use and share information collected about your visits to Widener University websites is restricted by each software publisher’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policies. 

**Digital Marketing and Ad Networks  **

We may sometimes use "interest-based" advertisements also known as "online behavioral advertising." Online behavioral advertising is advertising that is directed to you based, at least in part, on your Internet browsing behavior across websites and over time. Although we do not share Personal Information with the third parties that conduct interest-based advertising operations on our behalf, these third parties and their affiliates do collect certain information as a result of their javascript "tags" and other technologies being used on our website. The information that they collect includes the names of web pages you view (URL's), unique identifiers, your IP address, timestamp, and certain types of technical information.  A longer list of some of the technologies used for advertising and other purposes on our website and in our mobile apps are listed under the "Technologies Used" section. 

Third Parties May Collect Personal Information from Other Sources. 

Some third parties involved in advertising operations may maintain their own proprietary consumer databases that allow them to personally identify or track website visitors. Other third parties have proprietary technologies to determine what additional devices you may use, on which it can display relevant advertisements. 

Do Not Track 

Do-Not-Track is a public-private initiative that has developed a “flag” or signal that an Internet user may activate in the user’s browser software to notify websites that the user does not wish to be “tracked” by third-parties as defined by the initiative. The online community has not agreed on what actions, if any, should be taken by the websites that receive the “do not track” signal, and therefore Do-Not-Track is not yet standardized. Our website does not alter its behavior or change its services when it receives a “do-not-track” flag or signal from your browser. 

Your Privacy and Ad Choices  

You can make decisions about your privacy and the ads you receive. You can control whether companies serve you on-line behavioral advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance website and using its opt-out: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.  The DAA opt-out requires that cookies not be blocked in your browser. 

As an alternative to the DAA opt–out, you can also elect to block browser cookies from first parties (such as those from our website) and browser cookies from third parties (such as advertisers) by using the cookie blocking options built into your browser software.  If you block browser cookies, some parts of our website may not function correctly.  Also, blocking cookies will not stop third-parties from collecting IP address, data stored in "Flash" cookies, and certain other types of technical information that may uniquely identify your browser. 

**EMAIL**

**Email Messages**

If you send us email, we may share your email address and message content with others inside the University, and with persons and organizations outside the University, to the extent it is necessary to process and/or address your inquiry, or serve your needs.  Email addresses and message content may also be shared inside the University as deemed necessary by the University for disciplinary investigation.  The University may also share your email address and message content with others outside the University to the extent necessary to comply with legal investigations and/or to protect the University’s rights and interests. 

**Forwarding Email: Students’ Private Email Address**

If you forward email from your University-assigned email address to a private (non-Widener University) email address, we may send email to either or both addresses. We may also share your private email address with service providers inside and outside the University. 

**Faculty and Staff University-Assigned Email Addresses**

Faculty and staff University-assigned email addresses appear in the Widener email directory, and are visible to all students, faculty, staff, administrators and others who have authorized access to the directory.   We may share faculty and staff University-assigned email address with service providers inside and outside the University and do so according to university policies.  Faculty and staff must comply with university policies and ensure that all business transactions are conducted solely through university approved systems.
