# Wilmington Trust - Security & Privacy Statement

| 

**Wilmington Trust Internet Security.  
** When you visit wilmingtontrust.com, you may ask yourself, "Is it really safe to conduct bank business on the Internet?"  At Wilmington Trust, the answer to that question is **YES** , when the business activity is viewed as a partnership between a bank and its customer.  Our systems are designed for maximum protection of customer information and we place customer privacy in the highest regard. 

At Wilmington Trust, we recognize and respect the privacy expectations of our customers.  Our systems and policies have been engineered to provide maximum protection against unauthorized access to customer information.  The following information details what we at Wilmington Trust have done to ease your financial privacy concerns:

**Accessing wilmingtontrust.com  
** Visitors to wilmingtontrust.com can connect through any independent Internet Service Provider (ISP), such as AOL, Compuserve, Prodigy, etc.

**Privacy of online activity with Wilmington Trust´s On-Line Banking service  
** Our On-Line Banking service requires Internet access through 128-bit encryption versions of Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer browsers.  Encryption scrambles the transmission of information sent via On-Line Banking between you and Wilmington Trust´s computing systems.  Information that is encrypted at one end, is then decrypted (decoded) upon receipt at the other end.  128-bit encryption is the most secure form of encryption generally available.  In addition, your access to account information through On-Line Banking is protected by your unique User ID and Password.

**wilmingtontrust.com  
** When visiting wilmingtontrust.com all information is considered public information, unless you enter a private information area through the use of your login name and password.  Once you are connected to a private area of our site, the information transfer is encrypted to provide maximum protection against third party compromise.  You should only send confidential personal data or account information over the Internet when connected to a secure site offering data encryption.

**Privacy of information provided to Wilmington Trust  
** Occasionally, Wilmington Trust may conduct marketing surveys or research to help us evaluate products, services, and the changing needs of our customers.  It is Wilmington Trust's policy to keep this information confidential.  We will not share marketing data gathered from our website to individuals or business entities not affiliated with Wilmington Trust.

**Protecting Your Privacy on the Web  
** If you have access to a computer and a modem, then you are licensed to drive on the information superhighway.  The information superhighway can bring many benefits to our daily lives.  Unfortunately, it may create many new threats to our personal privacy as well.  Data transmitted via the internet can be vulnerable to compromise if you fail to recognize the potential weaknesses along the way.  The following information can help answer your questions about information security issues on the world wide web:

**_What are "on-line communications"?  
_** "On-line communications" are communications over telephone or cable networks using computers.  Examples of online communications include connecting to the Internet through an  ISP, connecting to a commercial online service such as America Online, CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, or Prodigy, or dialing into a computer bulletin board service (BBS). 

The Internet has raised some unique privacy concerns.  Information sent over this vast network may pass through dozens of different computer systems on the way to its destination.  Each of these systems may be managed by a different system operator ("sysop"), and each system may be capable of capturing and storing online communications.  Furthermore, the online activities of Internet users can potentially be monitored, both by their own service provider and by the sysop of any sites on the Internet which they visit.

**_What level of privacy can I expect in my on-line activity?  
_** Often the level of privacy you can expect from an online activity will be clear from the nature of that activity.  Sometimes, however, an activity that appears to be private may not be. There are virtually no online activities or services that guarantee an absolute right of privacy, and many online activities are open to public inspection.  In fact, according to federal law, it is not illegal for anyone to view or disclose an electronic communication if the communication is "readily accessible" to the public (Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. 2511(2)(g)(i)).

**_Can on-line services track and record my activity?  
_** Yes.  Many types of on-line activities do not involve sending e-mail messages between parties.  Internet users may retrieve information or documents from sites on the World Wide Web (WWW), or users may simply "browse" these services without any other interaction.  Many users expect that such activities are anonymous, but _they are not_.  It is possible to record many on-line activities, including which newsgroups or files a subscriber has accessed and which websites a subscriber has visited.  This information can be collected by a subscriber's own service provider and by any sysop involved with the subscribers "surfing" activity.  Records of subscriber "browsing patterns," also known as "transaction-generated information," are a potentially valuable source of revenue for on-line services.  This information is useful to direct marketers as a basis for developing highly targeted lists of on-line users with similar likes and behaviors. 

**_What can I do to protect my privacy in cyberspace?  
_** When you are sitting alone at your computer "surfing" the Internet, sending electronic mail messages and participating in on-line forums, it's easy to be lulled into thinking that your activities are private.  Be aware that at any step along the way, your online messages could be intercepted, and your activities monitored.  Here are some information privacy tips:

1.  Your account is only as secure as its password.  Create passwords with nonsensical combinations of numbers and upper and lower case letters, for example **tY8L3mX**.  **Change your password frequently**.  Never write it down or give it to someone else.  Don't let others watch you log in.  Never leave your computer logged in unattended.

2.  Contact the system operator of any on-line service you intend to use and ask for its privacy policy. Most of the commercial services have written privacy policies which are provided to new subscribers. All sysops should have a well-defined, written policy concerning privacy. Those that do not should be avoided.

3.  Assume that your on-line communications are not private unless you use powerful encryption.  Do not send sensitive personal information (phone number, password, address, credit card number, vacation dates) through chat lines, forum postings, or e-mail, and never post this information in your on-line biography.

4.  Be aware that on-line activities leave electronic footprints (cookies) for others to see, both at your own service provider and at any remote sites you visit.  Your own service provider can determine what commands you have executed and track which sites you visit. Some Web browsing software transmits less information to remote sites than other software.  You can avoid leaving tracks when you send e-mail messages by using anonymous remailers.

5.  The "delete" command does not make your messages disappear.  They can still be retrieved from back-up systems.

6.  If your children are on-line users, teach them about appropriate on-line privacy behavior.  Caution them against revealing information about themselves or your family.

7.  Take advantage of privacy protection tools.  There are several technologies which help online users protect their privacy.
