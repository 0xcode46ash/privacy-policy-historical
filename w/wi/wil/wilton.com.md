**Is it safe to make online purchases from Wilton?**  
Yes. We have made data security a priority. When a purchase is made or when personal information is provided to us, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to ensure that your information is encrypted. This means that no one else can read it while it is being transmitted over the Internet. SSL is regarded as the industry standard among encryption technologies. It is among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions.
