###  Additional Information on Our Children's Privacy Policy 

Wilson has a Privacy Policy and a special Children's Privacy Policy. The following procedures for children predominate any conflicting parts in the general privacy policies for Wilson and its affiliates and are in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. 

  * The types of information we collect from children 



For a child to register with us we collect: Name, birth date, gender, mailing address, e-mail address, a selected login ID and password and sports preferences. 

  * A child under 13 cannot register on our website without a parental/guardian consent. 



When a child under the age of 13 attempts to submit his or her registration information without parental consent, our system will reject the submission. 

  * The types of information we may send to children who have obtained parental/guardian consent 



Information on products, services, sports informational items, endorsers, events and/or contests concerning our products, our companies, our sports and our website. 

  * The types of interactive activities which may be available to registered children 



From time to time, Wilson may have free contests, challenges, testimonials, sweepstakes, or other promotions on our websites, or may offer products for purchase. From time to time we may also ask your child to participate in surveys or other interactive areas that will help us create and provide better products and services. 

  * We will not send information to, or retain information from, children under 13 who do not have parental/guardian consent. 



We will not collect any personal information from a child under the age of 13 until we receive a signed parental consent form. 

  * How our website collects the information 



After receiving your consent, we may collect additional information from your child by asking them, for example, questions during a contest registration or product registration. We will also collect information passively, including through use of "cookies" (a small text file that a website can use to identify the user's settings and online practices on our site) in order to allow for a personalized experience when that person contacts the website. We may use "cookies" to gather information that will be associated with a child’s personal information. 

  * How we would use the information collected from children 



If the parental consent form is returned to us, we may notify the child about our products, services, sports informational items, endorsers, events and/or contests concerning our products, our companies, our sports and our website. Personal information will also be used for order fulfillment if we sell products on-line and a child is authorized to enter into credit card transactions. Children, and their parents on their behalf, may always opt-out of future information requests or communications by sending us an email domainadmin@wilson.com. Please note that such requests may take up to 8 weeks to become effective. In addition, if you ask us to remove your name and address from our email or postal mailing lists, we will maintain your name in a "do not mail" file to ensure that we can honor your request. 

Unless a separate consent is given by the parent or guardian, children under the age of 13 will not be asked to consent to disclosure to third parties, and their personal information will not be disclosed to any third parties. A parent's consent to our collection and use of personal information about a child will never be treated as consent to disclosure of that information to unaffiliated parties. The term "third party" **does not include** (a) the sister companies of Wilson named Salomon and Atomic (skiing and snowboarding products) and Suunto (sports instruments), and (b) the web site hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our web site, as long as such parties have agreed to keep customer data confidential. 

We are prohibited from conditioning a child’s participation in an activity or contest on the disclosure of any more personal information than is reasonably necessary to allow the child to participate in that activity, and will not engage in such activity. 

  * How we protect information about children 



The law requires us to take reasonable security measures to protect personal information about children. Registration information submitted by a child's parent cannot be modified except through submission of a modified parental consent form or other written request. All such information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees and contractors who have special access rights to such systems. All contractors have agreed to maintain the confidentiality of our customer data. If a child provides credit card information, and information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our databases to be used and accessed only as described in this Policy. 

  * Parental control over children’s information 



We will delete personal information about a child upon receipt of a written request from the parent or guardian who initially submitted such information. Such written requests shall be sent to: 

Internet Applications Dept.   
Wilson Sporting Goods Co.  
8750 W. Bryn Mawr  
Chicago, IL 60631 

In the event of such a request, we will retain only information necessary for record keeping in connection with past transactions. Parents who submitted personal information about their children may also submit a signed written request to review or modify the information about their children to the address above. Before disclosing information about the child, we may request that the parent provide reasonable information about the parent for identification purposes, such as the parent’s name, address, phone number, credit card number, or other information.
