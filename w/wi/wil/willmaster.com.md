We only recommend things we believe in. As remuneration for the time and research involved to provide quality links, we generally use affiliate links when we can. Whenever we link to anywhere other than the Websites, you should assume they are affiliate links or that we benefit in some way.

Third parties and other Websites may be placing and reading cookies on your browser, or using web beacons to collect information, or logging access or activity, in the course of content pages, ads, or other content being served or responded to at the Websites. We have no authority over, and can not control, how the information is used.
