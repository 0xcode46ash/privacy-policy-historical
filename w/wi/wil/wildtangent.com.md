# WildTangent : WildTangent Privacy Policy

Privacy Statement

WildTangent, Inc. takes privacy and security concerns regarding its software products seriously. We do not sell personally identifiable information and will not share your personally identifiable information with any third parties without receiving your informed consent unless required by law. Please read the following carefully to learn more about WildTangent's privacy policy.

What this Privacy Policy Covers:

  * What information WildTangent collects through its products, how it is used and how you may opt-out. 
  * What "cookies" are and how WildTangent uses them.
  * The security associated with access to personally identifiable information.
  * WildTangent's policy regarding children under 13 years of age. 

What Information Does WildTangent Collect?

There are times when we may collect information from you through our Web site, during game and product downloads, purchases and updates. Below are the specific details on what, where and when information is collected and how it is used. 

**When Downloading a Game or Product:**  
You may be asked for certain information such as name and email address when accessing a particular game, entering a contest, or to allow secure access to subscription and to notify you about new games, relevant promotions and other information that may be of interest to you, unless you opt out of these notifications. Occasionally, and only with your explicit consent, WildTangent may share this information with select third parties. The information shared is then subject to the select third parties' privacy policy. WildTangent will not resell or disclose this information to anyone other than the select third party. At the time you are asked for this information, you will be informed of the following: 

  * What specific personally identifiable information is being shared with the select third party.
  * Who the select third party is.
  * A link to the privacy statement from the select third party, if available.

Should you decide not to share the information or interact with the game, this will not in any way affect your ability to interact with other WildTangent games. You agree that WildTangent will not be responsible or liable in the event that a third party violates its privacy statement. 

**When Purchasing a Game or Product:**  
In addition to the information described above, when you purchase a game or product from WildTangent, we collect standard payment and billing information, including your billing address, for use in processing the payment transaction. Your credit card number is submitted to the credit institution for normal, routine processing. WildTangent does not resell or share payment information with other companies or third parties, unless we believe it is necessary to comply with applicable law or court order. 

WildTangent may retain the services of certain outside contractors to perform services on our behalf (for example, to help provide technical support services, to deliver new game technology or to administer the delivery of emails to end users). At times, we must disclose relevant information about our customers to our contractors so they may provide specific services for WildTangent. WildTangent requires such contractors to keep your information strictly confidential and to use the information solely on behalf of WildTangent. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, such contractors are not considered "third parties" and WildTangent may disclose personally identifiable information to such contractors without additional notice. 

**System and Game Playing Information:**  
WildTangent collects system information through our Web Driver, the software that works with your system configuration to optimize your games based on your particular system. This information is used to upgrade the Web Driver and better optimizes Web Driver performance. The information collected for this purpose includes: 

  * CPU speed and type
  * System memory
  * Video card configuration
  * Connection speed

WildTangent also collects game playing information through the WebDriver that is used to determine how users are interacting with the game to determine ways that games may be improved and what features users like and do not like. The information collected for this purpose includes: 
  * Name of the game
  * Number of game launches
  * Number of new game starts
  * Time spent in game
  * Other, game-specific information, such as what levels were accessed, number of purchases vs. demo plays and where the game was downloaded from.

We may share system and game playing information with select third parties on an anonymous basis from time to time. 

**Game Updates and Notifications:**  
The Broadcast Games Manager is a service that updates your GameChannel menu located in your Start folder with the latest games. Periodically, your computer will connect to our servers to receive the latest gaming updates. New game availability information, or notifications are transparently, unobtrusively transferred to your computer in the background, allowing you to review it later when you're off-line. New Start Menu shortcuts will be created in your GameChannel folder that you can select to view the information. When you install a game through the notification or Broadcast Games Manager, your Start Menu shortcuts will be automatically updated. The Broadcast Games Manager reports the following information back to our servers. 

  * Your receipt of a notification
  * Number of times you click on a notification

We use the information gathered from the Broadcast Games Manager to better understand how it is used and what types of games are most popular with our users. We may share this information with select third parties on an anonymous basis from time to time.

"Cookies" and How WildTangent Uses Them:

Like most websites, WildTangent uses "cookies." Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as personalized notifications and WebDriver updates. 

The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies are required to access certain members-only or subscription areas of our website and we recommend you leave them turned on. 

Security for Personal and Payment Information:

We provide controls over the security of the transfer of all payment-related information, including credit card information. These security precautions include: 

  * The use of SSL-encrypted secure connections from the user's web site to the payment provider for personally identifiable information
  * Requirements that all WildTangent's employees, contractors and third parties in business with WildTangent adhere to a strict confidentiality policy



Children:

WildTangent does not ask children who identify themselves as being under the age of 13 for personally identifiable information, including their email address. Children under 13 are restricted from games or game activities that require them to enter personally identifiable information. 

Links to Third Party Web Sites:

WildTangent's Web sites and products contain links to other Web sites and products. WildTangent is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites or products. Please visit the privacy policies of these third party sites in order to understand their privacy and data collection practices. 

E-Mail Communications:

Periodically, WildTangent may send e-mail to users of our products who have indicated a preference to receive news, updates, special offers and other information relating to WildTangent's and select third-party products. To unsubscribe from WildTangent e-mail subscriptions, please go to the email subscription options web page and change your e-mail preference.

Occasionally, when downloading a game or product, you will be given the option to receive news, updates, special offers and the like directly from third parties. WildTangent is not responsible for the privacy practices or email practices of the third parties. Please review the privacy policies on the third party's websites in order to understand their privacy, data collection and email practices. 

Disclosures Required by Law:

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information when we believe in good faith that an applicable law, regulation, or legal process requires it, or where we believe disclosure is necessary to protect or enforce our rights or the rights of another user. 

Mergers and Acquisitions:

In the event that WildTangent or a portion of its assets are acquired by another company, customer information may be one of the transferred assets. 

Public Forums:

From time to time this site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups (an "Interactive Area") available to our Registered Developers or other visitors. Our Interactive Areas are unmoderated and uncensored. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal or proprietary information. If you use an Interactive Area, you are solely responsible for your own communications and the consequences of posting those communications. WildTangent does not assume any responsibility for the consequences of any Interactive Area communications on or arising from use of the Web Site. 

Beta Test Registration:

From time to time we may use the Web Site to register beta testers for new versions of our products. If you wish to become a beta tester, we will need to know who you are in order to solicit feedback, using e-mail. Our site's beta registration form will require you to give us contact information (name and e-mail address, for example) and unique identifiers (like ID numbers for any of our software you are using or testing), and information about your system configuration (like OS version, and driver versions) for support and testing purposes. We will use this information, and the feedback you give us, solely to improve our products. 

Your Agreement:

By using our games or other products or services, you agree to the use of information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. We may from time to time update this Privacy Policy and changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon posting. We will post any changes to our Privacy Policy at this website:
