Privacy Statement

WildTangent Inc. ("WildTangent") has created this privacy statement in order to disclose to you the information gathering and dissemination practices for this web site. 

**Browsing our web site**  
If you browse WildTangent's web site, you do so anonymously. You do not need to provide, and we do not collect, personal information, such as your e-mail address. When you visit our web site your browser supplies us with your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) but we do not link your IP address to any information that is personally identifiable. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. 

**Cookies**  
Like most web sites, our web site uses "cookies." A cookie is a small string of text that a web site can send to your browser. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your e-mail address. Most browsers can be configured to inform you when a web site wants to place a cookie, and you can decide whether to accept the cookie. If you are just browsing our site, you do not have to accept a cookie and you may still continue your visit. Please consult your browser's manual or help pages for information on how to set this preference. 

However, access to some portions of our site may be restricted to registered users. To gain access to such areas you must accept cookies as they are needed for site administration and security. 

**E-Mails and other communications from us or our partners**  
If you provide us with your e-mail or postal address, or have done so in the past, we may send you updates on the latest WildTangent products and promotions. At any time, you may tell us to discontinue sending such information by simply replying to the e-mail and informing us of your preferences. 

**Children**  
We do not solicit data from children. No information should be submitted to, or posted at, our web site by visitors under 18 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. 

**Public Forums**  
From time to time this site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups (an "Interactive Area") available to our Registered Developers or other visitors. Our Interactive Areas are unmoderated and uncensored. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal or proprietary information. **If you use an Interactive Area, you are solely responsible for your own communications and the consequences of posting those communications. WildTangent does not assume any responsibility for the consequences of any Interactive Area communications on or arising from use of the WildTangent site**

**Links to Other Sites**  
This site contains links to other sites. WildTangent is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

**Beta Test Registration**  
From time to time we may use this web site to register beta testers for new versions of our products. If you wish to become a beta tester, we will need to know who you are in order to solicit feedback, using e-mail. Our site's beta registration form will require you to give us contact information (name and e-mail address, for example) and unique identifiers (like ID numbers for any of our software you are using or testing), and information about your system configuration (like OS version, and driver versions) for support and testing purposes. We will use this information, and the feedback you give us, to improve our products. 

**Software Available from this web site**  
Our Web Driver software is designed to allow you to view artwork, text, video, audio, music, pictures, or other media files that are in our proprietary WildTangent file format (a "WildTangent File"). If you download our Web Driver software it will gather and store information about your computer that is specifically related to the functioning of the Web Driver software, such as processor type or the presence or absence of graphics accelerators and the related software drivers. The Web Driver software will not gather information from your computer about you, such as general application software you have installed or personal data that you store on your computer. The Web Driver software will report this configuration information to us on a regular basis. We use this information to identify your system's capability and to optimize the delivery of content to the Web Driver. 

When you view a WildTangent File over the Internet, the Web Driver software will record the serial number of that File and the universal resource locator (the "URL") of the web site that made the File available. If a WildTangent File is part of other software that you use, such as a game, when that WildTangent File is viewed, the Web Driver software will record the serial number of that file and information that identifies the software manufacturer. The Web Driver software will report this information to WildTangent on a regular basis. We combine this information with other similar information to verify the royalties that a web site or software manufacturer may owe us, and to assist in optimizing the delivery of content to the Web Driver. We may also share aggregated statistical information about the use of Web Driver software and the viewing of Files with some of our partners. If you do not provide identifying information (such as your name or e-mail) after you download the Web Driver software, or if the Web Driver software was installed from a CD or floppy disk as part of other software you purchased from a third party, we will not be able to associate any of the information reported to us by the Web Driver with you. If you obtain the Web Driver software from this web site and supply your name and your e-mail address when downloading the software, the information reported by the Web Driver will be associated with the identifying information you provided, but we will never supply any of this information, in a personally identifiable way, to any third party. 

We have industry standard security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. 

**Updates**  
While other aspects of our privacy policy are subject to change at any time and without notice, we will never give personally identifiable information about you to third parties without your prior consent. Please check here for updates.
