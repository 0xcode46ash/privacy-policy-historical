# Global Website Privacy Notice - Willis Towers Watson

Last Updated: May 2017

This privacy notice describes how Willis Towers Watson handles personal information collected through www.willistowerswatson.com and other websites controlled by Willis Towers Watson that link to this privacy notice. By providing personal information to us, you agree to this privacy notice.

### 1\. Scope of this privacy notice

This privacy notice only applies to willistowerswatson.com and any other website of Willis Towers Watson where a link to this privacy notice is provided (the “Websites”).

Willis Towers Watson operates worldwide through subsidiary and affiliate companies. A list of the Willis Towers Watson group companies (collectively, “Willis Towers Watson,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) [can be viewed here](http://investors.willistowerswatson.com/ "navigate to Investor Relations"). The Websites are controlled by Willis Towers Watson plc, unless a Website identifies (in its terms of use or otherwise) that it is controlled by another Willis Towers Watson entity. Willis Towers Watson group companies (as well as individual divisions of Willis Towers Watson) may have their own websites with their own privacy notices, in which case this privacy notice will not apply to such websites unless such website provides a link to this privacy notice. 

Websites and specific web pages linked from willistowerswatson.com may be subject to separate terms of use (including separate privacy notices). You must not provide Personal Information if you do not accept such terms of use.

Where links from our Websites are provided to non-Willis Towers Watson websites, Willis Towers Watson is not responsible for those websites. The inclusion of a link to a third-party website does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or our affiliates. These third-party websites will be governed by different terms of use (including privacy notices) and you are solely responsible for viewing and using each such website in accordance with the applicable terms of use. Willis Towers Watson is not responsible for how your Personal Information is handled by such third-party websites.

If you are a job applicant, please note that a separate privacy notice will apply to Personal Information collected through our job application portal. This can be viewed [here](https://willis-towers-watson.jobs.net/media/2017/7/b43141e8-b696-4885-bc73-9433176f7221-1499718357588.pdf "Navigate to PDF of Willis Towers Watson applicant privacy notice").
