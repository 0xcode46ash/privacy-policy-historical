### Privacy Policy

This is the privacy policy of BonaSource Inc. and applies to the Wild Apricot website (the "Website"). We have a firm commitment to safeguarding the privacy of our customers' personal information. Personal information is information about an identifiable individual. This includes information about your product and service subscriptions and usage. Publicly available information, such as a public directory listing of your name, address, telephone number, or electronic address, is not considered to be personal information.

### COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

When you register for an account we ask for information such as your name, organization name, and email address. We also collect the e-mail addresses and other personal information provided during account sign-ups, from email inquiries, forum registrations and forum postings, and from blog comments.

Also, you can import your existing database of members as well as add members manually or have them apply for membership online. If you have events open to the public, registration information is collected for your internal use. When registering for events, your event registrants will provide attendee information and payment information according to the selected payment method (e.g. Paypal online payment). Personal information of members and event registrants that is submitted to our Website will also be held by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

The personal information we collect is used to provide our products and services, for billing, for identification and authentication, for the general operation and improvement of our service, and to respond to inquiries, and is not used, shared with or sold to other organizations, except: to provide the products or services you've requested; to the applicable customer of the account in respect of which member or event registrant information is submitted to us; for collection purposes; to law enforcement agencies, in emergencies, for internal security matters, or where required by court order or search warrant; or when we have your permission. We do not contact our customers' members or event registrants except as related to operating our Website (for example: event notifications and reminders, membership renewals, security and other notifications). 

We may also record your computer's IP address with your order to help us identify fraudulent credit card use. We may share this information with the financial institution that issued the credit card with which an order was placed, or with law enforcement authorities if we determine, or are notified, that the use of the credit card was fraudulent.

Your personal information is not used or disclosed by us for any other purpose.

Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of our customers. As described elsewhere on the Website, our customers have access to the personal information of their members and event registrants. It is up to the customer to protect the privacy of their members and event registrants and we are not responsible for their collection, use or disclosure of your personal information. 

### COOKIES

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are required to use our service. We use cookies to record user session information.

### SECURITY

The security of your personal information is important to us. Our service has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We do not store credit card information in our database. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Website, you can email us at the address below.

From time to time, we may make changes to our Privacy Policy and you should review it periodically for any changes. Your continued use of this site following the effective date of any changes to these terms shall mean that you have accepted those changes, subject to your continuing right to notify us at any time as to how you would like us to treat your personal information.
