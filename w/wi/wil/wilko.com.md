We ask you not to share your password with anyone.

The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA").

Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.

We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our site and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

## 4: Disclosure of your information

We may share your information with selected third parties:

  * including any member of our group of companies and our third party suppliers who assist us in performing our services (such as our delivery companies, advertisers and market researchers);
  * in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets (and where it is necessary to disclose your information);
  * if Wilko or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party;

We will not disclose information that will identify you to our advertisers, but we reserve the right to provide them with aggregate information about the collective users of our services (for example, we may inform them that 500 men aged under 30 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day). We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the audience they want to target (for example, women in a certain location). We may make use of the information we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience; and
  * if we are under a duty to disclose or share your information in order to comply with any legal obligation or to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements that we may have with you, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Wilko, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction
