We do store your personally identifiable information in a secure manner, and also use Secure Sockets Layer encrypted connections to transmit your payment-related personally identifiable information to further protect its privacy. We may also collect unique usage information, which does NOT include personally identifiable information, to assist us in understanding our customers' use patterns and for use in developing new products and services.

**_2) WildGames Console Product &GameChannel_**

The following applies to our WildGames console product&GameChannel, which are game download managers and message services that we make available to our customers. They are designed to enable all users to reliably download and play games. Customers may obtain the WildGames console and GameChannel by choosing to download and install it from our website(s). If you elect the option of installing the WildGames console or GameChannel, your computer will automatically connect to our servers (if you are already connected to the Internet) when you launch the program to receive the latest information about games as they become available from WildTangent along with any WildGames console or GameChannel program updates. 

To help ensure that the WildGames console and GameChannel operate error free, they will collect and report anonymous information necessary to ensure reliable delivery of downloaded games and game content. This information may include data about whether or not content download and installation was successful, game session length (for trial versions), and WildGames console session length. 

The WildGames console and GameChannel may each be uninstalled from your computer by using the standard Add or Remove Programs feature in the Windows Control Panel. 

**_3) Content Products_**

The following applies to our games and other content products offered to you. Our games and other content products do NOT collect personally identifiable information. 

To help ensure that you have consistent, high quality experiences, and to assist us with product development and planning, we do collect anonymous usage statistics. We do this by assigning a unique identifier in our databases that is NOT linked to any of your personal information. The information gathered is used to accurately count the number of people using our games and other content successfully and is also NOT linked to any of your personal information. At times we may share this usage information with third parties, but only in an anonymous aggregated form - that is, we collect usage information about the thousands of times our games are played, and analyze it as a whole.

The Web Driver makes use of your computer's most advanced hardware accelerated media capabilities, and as such its performance is vulnerable to changes in your computer's configuration such as operating system patches, video driver changes, or browser updates. 

The Web Driver can be uninstalled from your computer at any time by using the standard Add or Remove Programs feature in the Windows Control Panel (please note that if the Web Driver is removed, your ability to access or use our game and other content, or third party content built for the Web Driver, will be impaired until you install the Web Driver).

We ask users, before providing personally identifiable information, to confirm their age. Anyone who identifies themselves as being under age 13 will be restricted from accessing or using any of our products or services that require them to enter additional personally identifiable information, and they will not be permitted to purchase any of our products or services.
