As a California resident, you have a legal right to request and receive in writing or by email the names and addresses of all such third parties who received your personally identifiable information during the previous calendar year and a list of the types of personally identifiable information disclosed to such third parties. To request such information, send an email to privacy@winhundredmail.com or write to California Privacy Information c/o WinHundred LLC., **260 West 36th Street FL10 New York, NY 10018** or fax to (212)-239-2850. For more information on how your personally identifiable information is collected and used, please read our Privacy Policy. 

**PRIVACY POLICY**

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT INCLUDING THE PRIVACY POLICY, WINHUNDRED.COM IS UNWILLING TO OFFER YOU THE SERVICE. YOU SHOULD LEAVE THE SITE. This Privacy Policy covers WinHundred LLC.’s treatment of personally identifiable information that WinHundred LLC. collects when you are on web sites operated by WinHundred LLC. and when you use WinHundred LLC.’s services. It is important that visitors are fully informed about the use of their personal information. For each visitor to our Website, our Web server automatically recognizes only the consumer’s domain name, but not the e-mail address (unless supplied by the consumer as a registration field entry).

## _Tell-A-Friend_

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.  WinHundred LLC. does not store this information and uses it for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. 

All collected information is stored in a technically and physically secure environment. Furthermore, access to this information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public. Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all user information. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at privacy@winhundredmail.com.

** Changes in this Privacy Statement**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
