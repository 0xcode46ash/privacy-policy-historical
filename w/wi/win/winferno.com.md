### Information Collection & Use

Orders  
If you purchase a product or service from us, we require certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information such as name, email, and shipping address and financial information such as credit card number, and expiration date.

We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders which include downloadable software with links sent to customers by email. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. We may also contact you if we find that you are experiencing problems downloading software you purchase from us.

Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see the "Choice and Opt-out."

Communications from the Site  
Special Offers and Updates  
In order to make sure that our customers have the most complete and up to date versions of software, we will occasionally send you information on software upgrades, products, special deals, and promotions. You can sign up for these emails from us on our registration page.

Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see the "Choice and Opt-out."

Service-related Announcements  
We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. Service related announcements are only sent when there is a problem or potential problem with software you have purchased from us.

Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account. Please see "Choice and Opt-out."

Customer Service  
Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email, or by phone when requested

### Information Sharing and Disclosure

Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)   
We share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners and advertisers. This information does not identify individual users. We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information. 

Personally Identifiable Information   
Agents   
We use an outside shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. While agents have access to personally identifiable information for the previously mentioned purposes, these companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes. 

Service Providers   
We use other third parties to provide fulfillment services such as CDs from our site. When you sign up for CD delivery, we will share your contact information including, name, email address, shipping address and phone number as necessary for the third party to provide that service. Third parties are occasionally used to complete email campaigns to customers. 

These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.

We post customer testimonials on our website which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer name. We do obtain the customer’s consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.

###  Choice/Opt-out
