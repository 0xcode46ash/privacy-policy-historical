 **Security**

Winter Park has gone to great lengths to ensure the security of your credit card and other personal booking information. The security measures we use include firewalls and encryption programs. Our industry-standard firewalls are a combination of hardware and software that securely separate the Internet from our organization's Web servers and our Web servers from our data. The firewalls are designed to prevent unauthorized access to our Web servers as well as our data.

We use Secure Socket Layer (commonly known as "SSL") Encryption whenever financial information, customer identification, personal information, and passwords are transmitted to our Web servers over the Internet.

In addition to the technically-driven security measures, we also follow company-wide internal privacy procedures. In most cases, our employees will see personal information only in the aggregate. For example, if you book a room, specific employees will see only the amount of personal information they need to complete your booking. Other employees will see the total number of rooms booked for a specific date, but not specific information about your booking. 

  


**Information Collection**

In a few areas on Winter Park's Web site, we ask you to provide information that will enable us to enhance your Web site visit, process your order correctly, and if necessary, follow up with you before or after your visit. For instance, we want your e-mail address or phone number so that we can contact you if, due to unforeseen circumstances (such as flood, fire, storm, avalanche), we need to rebook you into another room or get additional information.

From time to time, we may ask you questions, or use the data we collect from order processing, to better understand our customers' preferences. This information allows us to improve our products and services, and to offer you packages tailored to your preferences when appropriate. While some of this information is provided at your option, other information (e.g., the personal information required to process an order) is not optional.

We will request information from you when you:

  


  

  1. Register at the Winter Park website;
  

  2. Plan a trip to Winter Park;
  

  3. Place an order with Winter Park ( i.e. rent skis, ski and snowboard school, competition programs etc.;
  

  4. Provide feedback in an online survey;
  

  5. Participate in a sweepstakes or other promotional offer; and
  

  6. Subscribe to a newsletter or a mailing list.
  



In each of these instances, we may ask for any of the following types of information: name, e-mail address, phone number, mailing address, customer and trip preference information, customer ID, and password, as well as other similar personal information that is needed to register or subscribe you to services or offers.

If you do not want to receive promotional materials, special offers, or newsletters from us, we ask that you tell us this by opting-out, changing the type of information you receive from us, or unsubscribing, as explained below.

  


 **Cookies**

Depending on how you configure your Web browser, when you visit the Winter Park Web site, a small text file (a "cookie") is stored on your hard drive. Whenever you log onto the Winter Park Web site, our Web server looks for your cookie, and that's how we recognize that you've visited our Web site before so that you will not need to re-enter your personal information. Your Web browser can be configured to reject cookies, but if you do this, you'll have to re-enter your personal information each time you use our online booking and other pages.

 **Information Use**

Different information collected by us will be used for different purposes. Some personal information is required to process your order. For instance, we need to know your correct age, height, weight, foot size, skill level, and gender so that we can set up ski or snowboarding rental equipment before you arrive.

We may also use personal account information to generate statistics and aggregate reports for internal use and for sharing with affiliates. These statistics and aggregate reports will not contain any personally identifiable information. Your identity is kept anonymous. This information may be used to design programs and promotions that we and our affiliates think would be of interest to an identified group of customers. For example, we may want to develop special programs if our analysis of purchase data shows that a sufficient number of our guests share specific interests that would be better served with a special program.

In addition, we may use these detailed profiles in order to target special offers and promotions more effectively. Knowing more about you will allow us to personalize the delivery of our Web site's content to you should you wish to receive offers from us. We presently deliver personalized content via e-mail.

  


 **The Benefits of Providing Information**

Knowing more about you allows us to personalize the types of information we send to you. This means that you will probably receive less mail from us and what you do receive will be more likely to apply to you and your interests.

 **Children's Privacy**

Winter Park cares about the safety and privacy of children while they are online. Therefore, we comply with the Children's Online Privacy Act of 1998. Winter Park does not knowingly solicit data from, or about, people under the age of 13 years for any reason and will not accept such data without first obtaining parental consent. If we are notified that we have unknowingly received personal data from a child under the age of 13, we will promptly obtain parental consent or delete the information from our database.

Note: Winter Park assumes that visitors to its Web site are adults. We do not require any visitor to provide a date of birth at registration, although we do ask for an age or birth date when applicable for pricing purposes (for instance, children and seniors qualify for discounts on lift tickets). Federal law prohibits discrimination in public accommodations based on age, so when we send out information on lodging bookings we are required to treat all Web site members equally, regardless of age. 

We will make every reasonable attempt to send real estate offers only to customers 21 years old and older. If we are notified that we have unknowingly sent a real estate offer to a customer under the age of 21, we will promptly delete the customer's information from our mailing database.
