Privacy

This page summarizes the privacy policy and practices on The City of Winnipeg Internet site (“Winnipeg.ca”).

Principles

As a local public body The City of Winnipeg is subject to The Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. If you have any general questions about Manitoba’s The Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, please see the FIPPA Web site. The City of Winnipeg is committed to providing our visitors with an Internet site that respects their privacy. Winnipeg.ca does not automatically gather any personal information from you, such as your name, phone number, email or address. This information is only obtained if you supply it voluntarily through contacting us via email or online forms. 

Logging of Site Visitors

Like most Web servers, the City of Winnipeg server collects some information about visitors to the site. However, the server only logs the domain name of visitors. Depending on the setup of your internet service provider (ISP), this information may identify who you are; you may wish to contact your ISP for more information in this regard. The log data is analyzed for trends and statistics, and then aggregated. If you have any questions about the information gathered automatically by Winnipeg.ca, please contact the Corporate Web Manager.
