Logging of Site Visitors 

Like most Web servers, the City of Winnipeg server collects some information about visitors to the site. The server receives and records the Internet domain and Internet Protocol address from which you access the City's Web site, the date and time of the visit, and the pages visited. Depending on the setup of your internet service provider (ISP), this information may identify who you are; you may wish to contact your ISP for more information in this regard. The information is analyzed for trends and statistics, and then aggregated. The information is also used to monitor network traffic to prevent damage to the Web site and to help us make our Web site more useful to visitors.
