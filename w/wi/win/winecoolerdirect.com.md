We protect your account information against unauthorized access or release.  We do reserve the right to share your information with third party partners that we have approved. Outside of this scenario, we will not give, sell, rent, or loan any identifiable personal information to a third party unless you have authorized us or we are legally required to do so.

## Security

This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information.  Our shopping cart incorporates industry-standard secure server software (Secure Socket Layers / SSL) provided by GeoTrust into sensitive sections of our store.  All online transactions at WineCoolerDirect.com are handled using this encryption technology.  When you enter your credit card number into the order form, it is transmitted across the internet in an  encrypted (scrambled) form, then decoded when it gets out.  For added security, we also encrypt the credit card number when it is stored on disk.

To verify that we use GeoTrust SSL technology, you may click on the GeoTrust logo below:

  


Paymentech Services, a state-of-the-art credit card verification service, keeps WineCoolerDirect.com's transactions secure by encrypting all of your personal information while validating the transaction.  We use RSA encryption technology to scramble your data so that it would be virtually impossible to break into.

There are two ways to make sure you are browsing secure pages.  Both Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator indicate secure modes with a symbol - the image of a closed padlock.  You will know the information is protected if the closed-lock symbol pops into view in the lower right or left-hand corner of your screen while you are checking it out.  You can also verify secure pages by checking the address, or URL, listed on the scroll bar.  If you spot an "s"after the "http" at the beginning of the address, you know that you're browsing in a secure environment.

## Federal Law Limits Your Liability

Federal law limits an individual's liability if their credit card information should ever fall into the wrong hands.  Under the Fair Credit Billing Act of 1975, you may dispute the charges on your account with your credit card company and temporarily withhold payment while they investigate the situation.  Even if your creditor disagrees that unauthorized purchases were made, you're generally only liable for the first $50 in fraudulent charges.

## Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under any circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  If we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email.  However, if you have opted out of communication with the site then you will not be contacted, nor will your personal information be used in this new manner.  Users will have a choice whether or not we use their information in this different manner.  We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
