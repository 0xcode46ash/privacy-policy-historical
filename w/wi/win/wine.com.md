### Security

When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL (Secure Socket Layers) provided by VeriSign, the premier encryption Software Company available today. On a secure page such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers' switches to locked, as opposed to unlocked mode, and back to open mode when you are just browsing.

We also do everything in our power to protect user data offline. All sensitive information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a Customer Care representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information, and are required to lock their station when they leave their station.

All employees are kept up to date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter and whenever new policies are implemented, our employees are reminded about the importance of keeping customer data secure and safe at all times. The servers with personally identifiable information are stored in a locked and secure environment.

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to: [privacy@wine.com](mailto:privacy@wine.com).
