# privacy | Wink

We recognize that privacy is an important issue for our users. We have implemented industry standard policies to make sure your privacy is protected. This policy describes the personal information we collect about you, why we collect it, how we use it and when we share it with third parties. Our policy also describes the choices you can make about how we collect and use your information. If you have any questions about our privacy policy, contact us at: [feedback _@_ wink.com](mailto:feedback@wink.com?subject=wink:privacy "mailto:feedback@wink.com?subject=wink:privacy") ( _mailto:feedback@wink.com?subject=wink:privacy_ ). 

If our information practices change in the future, we will let you know by posting the policy changes on our Web site or by communicating directly with you through email. We will notify you of any such change before we use your information in a manner not previously disclosed in our privacy policy. You will have the opportunity at that time to opt out of any new use of your information. 

**Registration**

When you register with us, your personal information, including login name and password, is stored with us. We collect this data purely so you can log back in at any time and not have to re-enter your personal information. This information is not shared with other marketers. Registration is not required to use the service, however it is necessary if you choose to store your search or tag history, collections, or to edit pages. 

**Data Collection**

  * Search and Toolbar do not require any personally identifying information, such as name, physical address or email address. 
  * We collect limited, non-personally identifying information your browser makes available whenever you visit a website. This log information includes your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your query and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. We use this information to operate, develop and improve our services. 
  * When we require personally identifying information, we will inform you about the types of information we collect and how we use it. We hope this will help you make an informed decision about sharing your personal information with us. 



**Cookies**

  * On your first visit to us, a cookie is sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to help retain your search history, preferences, ratings and tags. By storing user preferences in cookies, we can also track user trends and patterns. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, without cookies you will not be able to retrieve your personal search preferences. 



**Information Sharing**

  * We do not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to other companies or individuals, unless we have your consent. 
  * If you register with us, we will not disclose your account information to other people or non-affiliated companies, except in the limited circumstances described in this Policy or with your consent. 
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. 
  * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. 
  * We may store and process personal information collected on our site in the U.S. or any other country in which we or our agents maintain facilities. By using our services, you consent to the transfer of your information among these facilities, including those located outside your country. 
  * In the event of a transfer of ownership, such as acquisition by or merger with another company, we will provide notice before any personally identifying information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 
  * We may share aggregated information with others. Examples of this include the number of users who searched for “Star Wars”. We do not share specific information about your searches. 
  * We use third party advertisers to serve ads on our search service. Information about the ads that you click on will be collected by those third parties and subject to their privacy policies. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area. 
  * We do not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. 



**Information security**

  * We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized destruction, alteration or disclosure of data. 
  * We restrict access to your personally identifying information to employees who need to know that information to operate, develop or improve our service. 
  * We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you. 



**Links**

  * The sites displayed as search results or linked to by Wink are developed by people over whom Wink exercises no control. These other sites may place their own cookies on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information.
