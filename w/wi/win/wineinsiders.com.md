# Wine Insiders - Privacy Policy

## Effective April 17, 2015

### Your Privacy Is Important To Us

We want you to know that when you use our Wineinsiders.com Internet Web site, your personally identifiable information will be respected and protected. The following are guidelines for protecting the information you provide to us during a visit to the Wineinsiders.com site.

### Wine insiders Information

When you make a purchase from Wine insiders we collect specific information to potentially include your name, address, email address, credit card type, number, expiration date and billing address, telephone numbers, and a password. This information is used to enroll you in one of the programs and bill you for your shipments. This information is also used to communicate with you on your Wine insiders account status and notify you of any special promotions for which you might be eligible. We may also provide our customer information and email addresses to third parties to facilitate the retail sale or fulfillment of customer orders, or to other vendors of Wine insiders. Those third parties may communicate with you about your order or about other offers using your customer information or email address. You may unsubscribe from our offers at any time by following the instructions in the "Unsubscribe" section of this page.

### Online Surveys

We value the opinions of our customers and want to improve your membership experience and our service offerings; therefore, from time to time, we may conduct research surveys. We may contract with third parties to perform this research, but the use of customer survey data is limited solely our internal analysis of your input, and no individual customer responses are shared with any other third parties.

### Emails

We use email addresses to deliver information relevant to our customers, such as discount specials, newsletters, surveys, account information, order updates and notification services. Email addresses may be shared with third parties for the purpose of completing the retail sale or fulfilling your order, or providing you with information or promotional opportunities that may be of interest to you in connection with our vendors, retail sales providers or fulfillment providers. You always have the option of opting out of emails as described below under "Unsubscribing".

### Domain Names

You can visit all parts of the Wine insiders website (with the exception of final checkout pages when making a purchase) without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our web servers may identify the domain names of visitors, but this data is not captured as personally identifiable information. This information is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed and similar site usage information in order to help us understand how to improve the site's content and functionality.

### Web Beacons

Our emails or web pages may contain electronic images known as "web beacons" or single-pixel gifs that allow us to count visitors to our web pages and deliver products or services. Web beacons collect limited information including cookie number, time and date of a page view and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides.

### Other Uses

Wine insiders may disclose personal information if required to do so by law, court order, or as requested by a governmental or law enforcement authority, or in the good faith belief that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable. Situations may include: to perform, maintain or enforce contracts formed between Wine insiders and its customers, to protect the rights or properties of Wine insiders, its customers or others, or when we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with or damage to our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities.

### Unsubscribing

As a member of the Wine insiders list, you will occasionally receive emails about special offers, new products, and other noteworthy news items. We hope you will find these updates interesting and informative. Of course, if you would rather not receive this information, you can simply reply directly to the email with the word "Unsubscribe" in the subject line. Alternately, you can call our Customer Service department toll-free at (888) 661-1246 and request to unsubscribe. You may also call our Customer Service department at the same phone number to request to modify or correct any of your contact or personally identifying information.

### Sale of Our Company

In the event of a merger, consolidation, or sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets or business of the Company by, with, or into another company (a "Successor"), one of the assets which would generally be transferred is the information we collect from our customers, members, and users. However, the use of this information by any successor would still be governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy, as amended from time to time, including any amendment after such transaction.

### Consent

By using this web site, you agree to the collection and use, consistent with applicable laws, of information available on or through this site (including your personally identifying information) by Wine insiders. Should a change to our privacy policy occur, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of the nature of the information we collect, how we use it, and the circumstances under which we disclose it. Unless otherwise required or permitted by applicable law (including the California Online Privacy Protection Act), we do not intend to use your personally identifiable information collected through this site in ways not described here without first providing you the opportunity to opt-out of that use.

### Internet Security

When you make an online purchase from Wine insiders, we use secure servers to protect your personal information. Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software encrypts the personal information that is transmitted between you and Wineinsiders.com. We only share your payment information with our payment processing provider, and do not share that information with any other third parties.
