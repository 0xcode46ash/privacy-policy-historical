What About Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms?

When you interact with our Site, we strive to make your experience easy and meaningful. We or our third-party service providers may use cookies, web beacons (clear GIFs, web bugs) and other technologies to track user activity and collect Site data.  We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. 

_Cookies_ _._ Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site, while other cookies are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at the Site.  There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based cookies. We also allow vendors to use cookies on our Site. 

  * _Session Cookies_.  Session cookies exist only during an online session.  They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer.  We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged in to the Site.  This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site. 
  * _Persistent cookies_. **  **Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer.  We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, which may be combined with other user information. 
  * _Third Party Cookies_ _._ We may also engage third parties to track and analyze Site data.  We use the data collected by such third parties to help us administer and improve the quality of the Site and to analyze Site usage.  This Policy does not cover such third parties’ use of the data. 



_Disabling Cookies_. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future.  The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable their web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse the Site; however, some Site features may not function if you disable cookies. 

_Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies_.  Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage.  We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.

_Site Analytics_.  As noted, we may use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Site.  We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Site.  We use these tools to help us improve our Site, performance and user experiences.

Third Party Links

Our Site may contain links to other third party websites.  Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but, instead, is governed by the privacy policies of those third party websites, and we are not responsible for the information practices of such third party websites.

How Secure Is Information About Me?

We have implemented commercially reasonable precautions, including, where appropriate, password protection and SSL encryption to protect our Site and the personal information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.  Please be aware that despite our efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security all of the time.

What Choices Do I Have About Receiving Marketing Communications?

We may send periodic emails to users regarding various promotions or other information that we believe may be of interest.  If we send you any news and newsletters, special offers, promotions or other information we think may interest you, you may tell us to stop sending you such promotional e-mail communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in any such e-mail.  Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests.  Further, if you opt-out of receiving such promotional emails, we may still send you non-promotional e-mails, such as emails about any orders you place.

What About Contests, Surveys and Other Promotions?

From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests, surveys and other promotions on our Site.  Participation is completely voluntary.  If you participate, we will request certain personal information from you.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).  We may use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, and for other purposes set forth above.  We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests on our behalf.

Children Under 13

Our Site is not designed for children under 13.  We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.  If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete such information from our systems.

Special Information for California Consumers
