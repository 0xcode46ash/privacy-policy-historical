# Privacy - Terms and Conditions

## WIND RIVER PRIVACY NOTICE

Wind River® Systems, Inc. ("Wind River") has created this privacy notice (the “Privacy Notice”) to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The Privacy Notice describes our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website and Wind River’s products and services.

### Information Collection and Use

IP addresses are automatically transmitted as part of any internet communication, and we use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our website and to gather broad demographic information. 

In order to access certain products or services on our site, users may need to provide their contact information (such as name, company name, mailing address, and email address), which may be used to send orders and information about our company to the users and to deliver the desired products or services. The user's contact information is also used to get in touch with the user as necessary in connection with product updates, events, support and customer service. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the access/choice/opt-out section below. Depending on the service or product that we are providing, we may also collect additional information such as location data and specific technical information about the user's development environment to enhance product functionality and better understand the needs of our customers. 

Personal information may also be shared with or disclosed to third parties in the following ways: 

  * To our affiliate entities and subsidiaries for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice.
  * To our partners when you access the documents, products or programs available on the Wind River Marketplace.
  * To our authorized service providers and suppliers who provide services to us such as web site hosting, data analysis, payment processing, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service, marketing, email delivery, credit card processing, auditing and other similar services.
  * To a third party in the event of any contemplated or actual reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).
  * As we believe is required, necessary, or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process and/or to respond to requests from competent public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations and those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, security, safety, and physical and intellectual property, and/or the rights of our affiliates, you, or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.



Certain features available through the Wind River website allow you to access websites, documents, programs and products offered by companies other than Wind River. Wind River is not responsible for the policies and practices of such third parties, including policies and practices related to privacy and security, data collection, processing, use, storage and disclosure. 

### Notice

We provide access to our Privacy Notice by:

  * Linking to it throughout our websites 
  * Referencing it in our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/company/terms/)
  * Incorporating it into our contracts, agreements, and other documents as necessary or appropriate



### Cookies

Wind River may save information regarding your visit to our website in the form of a cookie to allow the following:

  * A personalized browsing experience
  * Better tracking of usage of our website in order to improve the content of our website
  * To save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our support website



We collect only the domain name of visitors to our web pages, aggregate information on what pages users access, and information volunteered by the user, such as information provided for a survey, registration, or contest form. We do not collect email addresses of unregistered visitors.

A cookie is a small piece of information that is written to and read from your hard drive by your browser at the request of our Web pages. Information stored in cookies is not accessible to web pages from other websites. Cookies themselves cannot retrieve any information about you or your computer's configuration. Other than the small amount of disk space used to store a cookie, they are harmless.

You may choose to reject cookies either outright, or on a case-by-case basis by using the settings in your internet browser’.

### Feedback

The user can submit feedback via [webmaster@windriver.com](mailto:webmaster@windriver.com). Any feedback that is submitted through this area becomes the property of Wind River. We may use this feedback, such as success stories, for marketing purposes, or to contact you for further feedback on the site.

### Resumes / Contests

We give you the option of putting your resume in our database through our career site. By placing your resume in our database, your resume will be searchable by all Wind River Support Network users and Wind River Partners. We use our best efforts to grant access to this database only to said users and partners. However, we are not responsible if some other third party gains access to the database, and, subsequently, your resume. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However, individuals who have access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes in these instances.

We run contests on our site in which we ask users for contact information (such as their email address). We use contact data from our contests to send users information about our company. The user's contact information is also used to contact the user when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.

### Public Forums

This site makes news groups available to its users at news://comp.os.vxworks/ and groups.google.com/group/comp.os.vxworks/. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information, or any other information, online.

### Security

Wind River uses industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.

We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Notice. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Further, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will remain private.

### Choice/Opt-Out

We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us at the point where we request information about the user.

This site gives users the following options for removing their information from our database in order to not receive future communications or to no longer receive our services:

  * You can send an email to [webmaster@windriver.com](mailto:webmaster@windriver.com).
  * You can send mail to the postal address at the bottom of this page.



### Access/Correct/Update

This site gives users the following options for accessing, changing, modifying and/or deleting information previously provided to us:

  * You can send an email to [webmaster@windriver.com](mailto:webmaster@windriver.com).
  * You can send mail to the postal address at the bottom of this page.



For your protection, we will only implement requests with respect to personal information about you (not anyone else), and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We will comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable and in accordance with applicable law. We may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, as required under applicable legal obligations, and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting such change or deletion (e.g., when you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the personal information provided until after the completion of such purchase or promotion). Some of your information may remain within our systems and other records, in compliance with applicable law.

### FAQ

**Q1:** How can I quit a registration wizard before finishing, and what happens to the information I've already typed in?   
**A:** If you begin a registration form, then decide you don't want to finish it, just click the cancel button on the bottom of the page. You will be delivered to the entry page of the profile center. None of the information entered on the page where you quit the wizard will be saved. 

**Q2:** Do I have to answer all of the questions presented in a form?   
**A:** You do not have to answer all of the questions in the wizard—only those items marked with the required symbol (*), or indicated in red. Answers to other questions help us better understand who you are so that we can tailor our future products, website updates, and programs (should you choose to participate) to better meet your needs.
