### Privacy Statement for windriver.com

Wind River® Systems, Inc. ("Wind River") has created this privacy statement to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: www.windriver.com. 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information. We use cookies to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our support website. 

Our site's registration forms require users to give us contact information (such as their name, mailing address, and email address). We may use contact information from the registration forms to send you information about our company. The user's contact information is also used to contact the user when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. We also gather specific technical information about the user's development environment to better understand the needs of our customers. 

This site contains links to other sites. Www.windriver.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. 

**[Feedback](https://web.archive.org/company/feedback.html)**  
The user can submit feedback via [webmaster@windriver.com](mailto:webmaster@windriver.com). Any feedback that is submitted through this area becomes the property of Wind River. We may use this feedback, such as success stories, for marketing purposes, or to contact you for further feedback on the site. 

**Resumes**  
We give you the option of putting your resume in our database through our career site. By placing your resume in our database, your resume will be searchable by all Wind River Support Network users and Wind River Partners. We use our best efforts to grant access to this database only to said users and partners. However, we are not responsible if some other third party gains access to the database, and, subsequently, your resume. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However, individuals who have access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes in these instances.

Our site uses an order form for users to request information, products, and services. We collect users' contact information (such as name, mailing address, and email address). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders and information about our company to our customers. The user's contact information is also used to get in touch with the user when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. 

We run contests on our site in which we ask users for contact information (such as their email address). We use contact data from our contests to send users information about our company. The user's contact information is also used to contact the user when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. 

**Public Forums**  
This site makes news groups available to its users at news://comp.os.vxworks/ and [groups.google.com/group/comp.os.vxworks/](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.vxworks/)). Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

**Security**  
Wind River uses industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. 

We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Further, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will remain private.

We collect only the domain name of visitors to our Web pages, aggregate information on what pages users access, and information volunteered by the user, such as information provided for a survey, registration, or contest form. We do not collect email addresses of unregistered visitors. 

A cookie is a small piece of information that is written to and read from your hard drive by your browser at the request of our Web pages.
