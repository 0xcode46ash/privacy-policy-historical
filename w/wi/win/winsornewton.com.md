This Privacy Policy outlines what happens to any personal data that you supply to us, or that we gather from you when you are on this site.

In operating our website we may collect and process the following data about you:

**Winsor & Newton Cookie Policy**

> **What are cookies?  
>  **Cookies are simple text files which your browser stores on your computer or other device. You’ve probably got hundreds of them, several from each website you visit.
> 
> They enable websites to recognise you when you return and as you move around from page to page in their site. They might hold information such as a unique id, your name, when you last visited, how far you got through a process, what information you are interested in. They enable much of the magic of the web (they used to be called magic cookies). Importantly, they can do your computer no harm.
> 
> **Why are we telling you all this?  
>  **Because it’s the law. Since May 26th 2012, it is a legal requirement that all online service providers get consent for all but a few uses of cookies. This is intended to put web users in control of where their data is shared or used for targeting. You’ll be seeing a lot of this on the web.

> **What cookies do we use on this site (and why)?  
>  **We use cookies to understand how people use our site so that we can improve it in the future, and cookies to provide a seamless experience to our customers. We do not hold any personal information in our cookies. 
> 
> **Sharing Tools  
>  **We would like to draw your attention to the fact that our site carries embedded ‘share’ buttons to enable users of the site to easily share articles with their friends through a number of popular social networks. These sites may set a cookie when you are also logged in to their service. Winsor & Newton does not control the dissemination of these cookies and you should check the relevant third party website for more information about these.

Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf.
