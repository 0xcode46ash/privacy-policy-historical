# WIND | Privacy Policy

PRIVACY POLICY 

This website (the “Website”) is operated by Globalive Wireless Management Corp. (“WIND”, “us” or “we”). 

WIND is very sensitive to the privacy concerns of visitors to this Website. The purpose of this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) is to describe what types of Personal Information (as defined below) we collect from visitors to our Website, the purposes for which we use the information, what rights you have regarding Personal Information you submit, and to whom and under what circumstances we disclose Personal Information. 

COLLECTION OF INFORMATION 

Personal Information 

In this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means information about you that is personally identifiable, such as your name, home address, online account numbers, passwords, email addresses and so on and that is not either publicly available or not part of your contact details as an employee of an organization. 

We only collect Personal Information when you voluntarily submit it to us. However, some functions of the Website may not be available if you do not submit certain Personal Information. For example, we require you to provide us with your email address when registering on the Website to validate your identity, communicate with you and administer the Website. If you choose not to provide such Personal Information, the functions of the Website available to registered users would not be available to you. 

Use of Information 

WIND and its affiliates may use Personal Information collected from visitors to this Website for any of the following purposes: 

  * to send marketing and other communications to our visitors;
  * to conduct marketing research;
  * to understand your needs and eligibility for our products & services;
  * to develop, enhance, market or provide products and services;
  * to respond to specific requests from our visitors;
  * to administer, manage and protect the security or integrity of the Website; and
  * to meet legal and regulatory requirements.



Marketing communications will only be sent to you if you elect to receive them when you register. Your Personal Information will not be used for any other purpose without your consent. 

Disclosure of Information 

WIND will transfer or otherwise disclose Personal Information it collects from its site visitors to employees and independent contractors of WIND, subsidiaries and affiliates of WIND, consultants, and other business associates, service providers, and suppliers, if the disclosure will enable that party to perform a business, professional, or technical support function for WIND, or if required to do so by law. Some service providers may be located in other jurisdictions that do not have privacy legislation similar to that found in Canada, and information in such jurisdictions may be accessed pursuant to the laws of those countries. WIND will also disclose Personal Information it collects from its site visitors to WIND’s marketing and business partners, who may use the information in connection with their business operations, such as to send marketing and other communications to visitors of our site. We will also transfer or otherwise disclose Personal Information in response to judicial process, and, as permitted under provisions of law, to provide Personal Information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on a matter related to public safety. 

Security of Information 

We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard your Personal Information. We take reasonable steps designed to limit access to Personal Information only to persons and entities engaging in activities provided for by this Privacy Policy. 

Acceptance of Privacy Policy 

By visiting this Website, you are agreeing to the practices described in this Privacy Policy and consent to our collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. To the extent that any of other sites accessible through this Website have different privacy practices from those stated in this Privacy Policy (including other sites that may be maintained by WIND or its affiliates), those privacy practices govern the collection and use of information you provide when visiting those sites. WIND is not responsible for the policies, content, and practices of third parties. In addition, different privacy policies may apply in respect of your other dealings with WIND or its affiliates outside of your use of the Website. For example, if you become a customer of WIND. 

Changes to this Privacy Policy 

On occasion, it may be necessary for WIND to change the terms of this Privacy Policy. To ensure that you are aware of current privacy practices, we recommend that you check this site periodically. You can be assured that any changes that we make will not materially change how we handle previously collected Personal Information without your consent.
