# Privacy - Wings for Life World Run

**Data Privacy Policy**

 **1\. General**

Like every Website owner, we also collect, process, and use data. Protecting your personally identifiable data within the scope of all services provided by us is very important to Red Bull. Therefore, we collect, process, and use your personally identifiable data strictly in accordance with the relevant legal regulations.

The following policy provides an overview of the type of data we collect and how they are used and forwarded, the security measures we take, and how you can exercise your rights.

The office responsible for issues related to data privacy law is Red Bull GmbH, Am Brunnen 1, 5330 Fuschl am See, Austria.

We collect, process, and use both personally identifiable data and non-personally identifiable data. Red Bull understands personally identifiable data to mean information such as your actual name, your mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address, and complete IP address. Information that does not allow us to determine the identity of a person, such as the number of visitors to a Website, the duration of sessions on a Website, and the links used on the Website, is not personally identifiable data.

We collect and process data in the context of use of the Website. In addition, we collect and process data for services that require registration, such as registration for the Wings for Life World Run, queries from users and customers, feedback, and newsletter subscriptions.

For visits to the Website without registration for such additional services, Red Bull collects, processes, and uses the following data:

To transfer data to you, the Web server collects information on the device used to access the Website, the Web browser used, the volume of data transferred, the time of access, the referrer, and the IP address stored in the server’s log file. The log files are deleted at the end of the session on the Website.

 **2\. Registration and Login**

Direct Registration through Registration Form:

You can register by filling in the Registration Form and thereby open an user account.

To register it is always necessary to specify your first name, last name and a valid e-mail address. Optionally a user account where you need to also state a username and a password can be created. 

When signing up with an e-mail address, we will ask you to confirm your registration by sending an e-mail to your e-mail address, in particular to ensure that the application originates from you.

Direct Login through Registration Form:

After successfully registering you can, then log in with your access data.

Registration through Social Media Accounts:

You have the possibility to start a registration for our service by selecting the field "Login with Facebook" (Facebook Connect) (or where applicable another social media network), registering with your details from that social media network. This requires that you already have a user account from the relevant social media network. If you use this feature of the social media network, the terms and conditions of use and data privacy policies of that particular social media network also apply.

If you choose to register via a social media network, you will first be forwarded to the provider of that social network and may be asked to log in by entering your login information on that social media network. Your access data is in any case entered directly on the server of the social media network.

Then you can connect your profile from the social media network with our service. In this context, you also learn that and what data from your profile on the social media network will be made available to us. In the event the relevant service is Facebook Connect it includes stating your name, username, profile pictures and title, age, gender and your friend list to your email address and your "public profile" Facebook data. What information from your public profile on Facebook is included, depends on your personal privacy settings. In no case, however, we are informed about your access data for the social media network.

If you allow the use of this data stored at the relevant social media network by our service, your user account you are creating at our service, is connected to your user account on the relevant social media network, so that the data from your account on the relevant social media network is transferred to us. Hereby, the establishment of your user account is now successfully completed.

If you have chosen this option of registering through a social media network, we store this fact. It is also saved to your account, which Terms and Conditions you agreed to, and what data protection consents you have given.

Should your personal details change, please correct them directly in your user account.

Without your consent we will in no case transfer basic data of your user account to a social media network. However, the social media network (such as Facebook) receives certain information in connection with the use of the Website. This information is stored in your user profile on the social-media network and, if applicable, published on the network. In the case of Facebook, according to information provided by Facebook, this includes information as user ID, websites visited, the date, time, browser type and version, operating system and version, and the IP address and Facebook cookies already stored in the browser. More information can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/full_data_use_policy#aboutplatform). Regarding Twitter more information can be found [here](https://twitter.com/privacy).

If you wish to cancel the connection between your user account and your social media network user account again, please notify the social media network in question and make the necessary changes in your profile there. We have then no more right to use the information from your social media network profile. You then need to also re-register for our service.

Login through Social Media Accounts:

If you have selected to register through a social media network, log on by clicking on the button "Login with Facebook" (or as the case may be any other social media network). As part of this registration process, you will then log in to the respective social media network and are thereby automatically logged into our service. If you are already logged in to the social media network in question, you will thus automatically be logged in to the service. Without using a social media network, you simply log on with your normal access data for the service.

 **3\. Cookies**

Cookies are used on the Website. They are text files with information on the use of the Website (visited Web pages, number of visits, time of visits, duration on individual pages, the browser used, the operating system used, etc.). Cookies can be of a lasting nature – meaning they remain until they are deleted – or temporary, in which case they are deleted, for example when a session ends. As purely text files, cookies do not intervene in your computer’s system, but only influence the presentation of content of the Website you visit.

Usage patterns contained in cookies are evaluated anonymously to allow Web advertising companies to subsequently display Web advertising (e.g. banners) on other Websites targeted to the respective user’s interests. Our Website uses pseudonymous cookies, each of which is assigned a random string of numbers or numbers and letters; based on this string, we can determine that the visit is from the same user. The identity of this user cannot be determined based on this string of numbers. Our service providers also use such cookies.

In addition, the Website sets a cookie with your current IP address with the last octet truncated. These cookies are primarily used to record the distribution of banners, pop-ups, the page view count, and the multimedia content and thus to make the use of a Website easier and more effective. In no case are your personally identifiable data – name, address, and e-mail address – stored in the cookies.

If you would like to waive the advantages of cookies and opt out of the analysis of user behaviour, you can delete existing cookies from your browser and block future cookies by means of your browser settings. Use your browser’s Help menu to learn how to make these settings.

If you delete all cookies via the browser settings, you will also delete any opt-out cookies. You must then reset them. If you use multiple browsers, you must set opt-out cookies in each browser.

 **4\. Web analysis services**

The Website uses Web analysis services, in particular Webtrekk and comScore, as well as Webtrends and Google Analytics, which in turn use cookies.

Webtrends:

As a general rule, the information on your use of our Website generated by the cookie from Webtrends Analytics, a service of Webtrends Inc. (“Webtrends”), is transmitted to a Webtrends server in England and stored there; in individual cases, it is also forwarded to Webtrends servers in the United States. However, within the Member States of the European Union or in other contractual states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area, Webtrends first truncates your IP address by means of IP anonymisation on this Website.

The full IP address is transmitted to a Webtrends server in the United States and truncated there only in exceptional cases. Webtrends uses the generated information on our behalf to evaluate your use of our Website in order to compile reports on Website activities and to perform other services for us associated with Website use and Internet use. In no case will Webtrends combine the IP address collected using Webtrends Analytics with other Webtrends data.

Webtrends will transmit the information collected using Webtrends Analytics to third parties as required if Webtrends is legally bound to do so or if third parties process this information on behalf of Webtrends. You can also prevent these cookies from being stored using the aforementioned settings in your browser.

Google Analytics and Adwords:

In the event that Google Analytics, a service of Google Inc. (“Google”), is used, the information on your use of our Website generated by the cookie is always transmitted to a Google server in the United States and stored there. However, within the Member States of the European Union or in other contractual states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area, Google first truncates your IP address by means of IP anonymisation on this Website; we use the “–anonymize()” extension. The full IP address is transmitted to a Google server in the United States and truncated there only in exceptional cases. Google uses the generated information on our behalf to evaluate your use of our Website in order to compile reports on Website activities and to perform other services for us associated with Website use and Internet use. In no case will Google combine the IP address collected using Google Analytics with other Google data. Google will transmit the information collected using Google Analytics to third parties as required if Google is legally bound to do so or if third parties process this information on behalf of Google. You can also prevent these cookies from being stored using the aforementioned settings in your browser.

In addition, you can object to the collection of the data generated by Google’s cookie and related to your use of the Website (incl. your IP address) and prevent processing of these data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following link: <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de.>

Webtrekk Analytics

Our Website uses the Web analysis services from Webtrekk GmbH, Boxhagener Strasse 76-78, 10245 Berlin, to collect statistical data about the use of our Website and to optimise our offering accordingly. The collected data are forwarded only to our statistics service provider, Webtrekk GmbH. Webtrekk GmbH is certified for data privacy in the area of Web analysis. The data are collected via cookies. Your IP address is anonymised, stored, and forwarded so that you cannot be identified by means of your IP address.

 **5\. Social Plug-ins**

Facebook:

We use social plug-ins of the facebook.com network, specifically the “Like” and “Share” buttons. These plug-ins are offered by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA, and transmit data to Facebook. They are identified with the Facebook “f”. When this plug-in is activated, your browser establishes a connection to the Facebook servers. The content of the plug-in is transmitted directly to your browser. The plug-in is part of Facebook and merely displayed on our Website. Any interaction via the plug-in is an interaction on facebook.com and not on our Website. We do not have any influence over the content of the plug-in. Facebook also sets one or more cookies in your browser.

Facebook receives data through the active plug-in and the cookie(s), even if you have not yet clicked the plug-in yourself and even if you do not have a Facebook account. According to Facebook’s statements, these data include the visited Website, date, time, browser type and version, operating system and version, and to our knowledge the IP address and Facebook cookies already stored in your browser. Facebook can thus track what other Websites with Facebook content (including this plug-in) you visited. Facebook uses these data to detect errors in its own system; to improve its own products and adapt its own products to user behaviour; to monitor, place, and individualise advertisements; for localisation; for recording the way in which Websites with Facebook content are used; and for market research purposes.

If you are logged into Facebook when the plug-in is activated, your Facebook login ID will also be transmitted to Facebook. In this way, your visit to our Website will be associated directly with your Facebook account. Facebook then identifies you with your Facebook name and your private data from your Facebook account. In the event of interaction with the Facebook plug-in, meaning if you click it, this information will be transmitted not only to the Facebook server, but also published on Facebook and displayed to your friends, depending on the settings of your Facebook account. If you want to prevent this, you must first log out of your Facebook account before activating the Facebook plug-in and then delete all Facebook cookies after visiting Websites with Facebook plug-ins. According to Facebook’s own statements, it stores all these data for up to 90 days. After that, Facebook anonymises these data and uses them only in anonymised and condensed form, such as to improve advertisements.

The Facebook plug-ins are set so that we do not receive any of the information that is transmitted with the plug-in or the Facebook cookies. We can determine only whether you have clicked the plug-in and shared our content with others.

For more details on how Facebook handles your data, refer to Facebook’s data privacy policy at <http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/>.

Twitter:

We use social plug-ins of the Twitter short message service, specifically the “Share” button. This plug-in is offered by Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market St., Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA, and transmits data to Twitter. The plug-in is identified with the Twitter logo.

When this plug-in is activated, your browser establishes a connection to the Twitter servers. The content of the plug-in is transmitted directly to your browser. We do not have any influence over the content of the plug-in. Twitter also sets one or more cookies in your browser. Twitter receives data through the active plug-in and the cookie(s), even if you have not yet clicked the plug-in yourself and even if you do not have a Twitter account. According to Twitter’s statements, these data include the visited Website, the previously visited site, date, time, browser type, operating system, your IP address, search terms used, your location, your mobile service provider, your mobile device, your application ID, and Twitter cookies already stored in your browser (known as Twitter widgets). Twitter can thus track what other Websites with Twitter content (including this plug-in) you visited. Twitter uses these data in particular for its tailored suggestions to recommend specific tweets to you; to improve the system and products; to adapt to user behaviour; for localisation; for recording the way in which Websites with Twitter content are used; and for market research purposes.

If you are logged into Twitter when the plug-in is activated, Twitter can establish a connection to your Twitter account. If you want to prevent this, you must first log out of your Twitter account before activating the Twitter plug-ins and then delete all Twitter cookies after visiting Websites with Twitter plug-ins.

According to Twitter’s own statements, it starts deleting widget data after ten days and the process can last up to seven days. After that, Twitter uses only condensed, anonymised data, such as how frequently a site with Twitter content was visited.

The Twitter plug-ins are set so that we do not receive any of the information that is transmitted with the plug-in or the Twitter cookies. We can determine only whether you have clicked the plug-in and shared our content with others.

For more details on how Twitter handles your data, refer to Twitter’s data privacy policy at <https://twitter.com/privacy>.

 **6\. Other services**

The data shared by means of the contact form are used only to process your query.

If you register for one of our events using a Web form, depending on the form, your title, your name, your address, your telephone number, your date of birth, your e-mail address, and certain information and preferences related to participation are collected and stored to enable you to participate in the event.

Red Bull occasionally works with service providers, such as for dispatching mail and other services. To the extent that these service providers come into contact with your personally identifiable data, such as when mail is dispatched, Red Bull complies with data protection regulations, especially through corresponding commissioned data processing jobs.
