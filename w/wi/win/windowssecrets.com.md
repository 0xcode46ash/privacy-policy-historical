All subscribers to the Windows Secrets Newsletter and visitors to the WindowsSecrets.com Web site are covered by our Ironclad Privacy Policy:

  1. We will never sell, rent, or give away your address to any outside party, ever;
  2. We will never send you any unrequested e-mail, besides newsletter updates; and
  3. All unsubscribe requests are honored immediately, period.



**What this Means**  
This Privacy Policy applies solely to information we collect for the Windows Secrets Newsletter (the "Newsletter") and through the WindowsSecrets.com Web Site (the "Web Site"). For information on how we handle information collected by any other means (e.g., via customer information forms, etc.), please contact us at the addresses listed below.

**1\. We will never sell, rent, or give away your address to any outside party, ever.**  
If you are a subscriber to the Newsletter, we collect your e-mail address. We then send each issue of the Newsletter to your e-mail address, or we send a notification to your e-mail address that the Newsletter is available at the Web Site, according to your preference, if you stated one. When you set your preferences or upgrade to the paid version of the Newsletter, you may provide some additional personal information, including an alternate e-mail address and credit card information.

Visitors to the Web Site who send us an e-mail or who use the form on the [Contact Us](http://windowssecrets.com/contact) page may provide additional information, some of which may be personal information. For each visitor to the Web Site, we may collect the Internet Protocol address from which you accessed the Web Site, the contents of forms and queries, what items you clicked on each applicable Web page, information about the browser you are using, and other usage information. Some of this information is personal, and some of it is not.

Your personal information will never be used except to make the Newsletter available to you if you are a subscriber, or to contact you if there is a question about your Newsletter subscription or to respond to a query about the Newsletter or the Web Site. We will never sell, rent, or give away your personal information to any outside party, ever. We will share your address and other personal information only with persons or companies who help us prepare and distribute the Newsletter and maintain the Web Site, but we will not give them the right to contact you on their own behalf or on behalf of anyone else. In addition, we may disclose your personal information to a person or company that subsequently owns or maintains the Newsletter or the Web Site, but only if that person or company agrees to comply with the provisions of this Privacy Policy with respect to the use of your information.

When you visit a page at the Web Site to sign up for a subscription to the Newsletter, view an issue of the Newsletter, or to use some of the other resources on the Web Site, your browser may write a "cookie" file to your computer. A "cookie" is a tiny, plain-text file that counts the number of unique visitors and what Web sites they came from. It does not contain any personal information. You can stop your browser from using cookies by changing your settings, but there is no privacy benefit from doing so as far as our Web Site is concerned.

**2\. We will never send you any unrequested e-mail, besides newsletter updates.**  
In addition to the other e-mails discussed above in this Privacy Policy, we may send you e-mail updates about your subscription to the Newsletter or your use of the Web Site. We will never send you any other unrequested or unrelated e-mail.

**3\. All unsubscribe requests are honored immediately, period.**  
If you choose to unsubscribe, we will miss you, but we will honor your request. Our computer systems usually process unsubscribe requests within a few moments of receiving the request. If our computer systems are temporarily offline, we will take all reasonable steps to get them working again. Note that we can only honor unsubscribe requests that provide all of the information we need to unsubscribe you, such as the specific e-mail address that you use for your subscription. For example, if you provide us with a name, but not a complete e-mail address, then we cannot unsubscribe you from the Newsletter or the Site as there may be many different subscribers with similar-sounding names.

**No Information from Children**  
We do not knowingly solicit or collect information from any individuals under the age of 13, nor do we provide any of our products or services to individuals under the age of 13. If you believe that we have inadvertently collected any such information, or provided any such products or services, please contact us immediately so that we may delete the information.

**How to Access or Correct Your Information**  
You can access your personally identifiable information that we have collected through the Web Site and that we still maintain by contacting us as described below. You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows that our records are incorrect, although we may refuse your requests in our sole discretion. To protect your privacy and security, we may also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to your personally identifiable information or permitting you to make corrections.

**Changes to the Privacy Policy**  
We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy from time to time in our discretion. If we modify this Privacy Policy, we will post the revised Privacy Policy on the Web Site, and the revisedPrivacy Policy will take effect 30 days after posting. We will attempt to notify you of the posting through the e-mail address you provided. It is your responsibility to read e-mail messages from us and to periodically review this Privacy Policy page.

**How to Contact Us**  
We encourage you to contact us if you have any questions or concerns about the use of your information. Please use the form on the [Contact Us](http://windowssecrets.com/contact) page, or send postal mail to WindowsSecrets.com, Attn.: #120 Editor, 1700 7th Ave., Suite 116, Seattle, WA 98109-4599 USA.
