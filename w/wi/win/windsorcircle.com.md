(“ **Windsor Circle** ,” “ **we** ,” “ **us** ,” or “ **our** ”), we respect and protect the privacy of our customers (“ **you** ,” “ **customer** ,” or “ **your** ”), website visitors and, to the extent required under applicable law, certain third parties associated with our customers.  This “ **Privacy Policy** ” describes our practices for how your personal information is collected and used.  This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect and maintain about you when you visit the Windsor Circle website (“ **Site** ”) or use any Windsor Circle product or service (“ **Services** ”), and from other sources.  By visiting the Site, you expressly consent to the use and disclosure of your information as described below.  If you are a customer, this Privacy Policy is made subject to, and is a part of, our standard terms of use.

**Information Collected**

We primarily collect and maintain three categories of personal information: (i) account information (including your contact information) provided when you activate, subscribe for or otherwise use the Services (“ **Customer Information** ”); (ii) data collected through the Services about the behavior and demographics of your customers and other third parties that consent to the receipt of marketing and other content from you, or that otherwise interact electronically with you or your website (“ **Target Data** ”); and (iii) data about visitors to the Site who may or may not be our customers, including technical information and information about the use of our Site.
