 **Cookies & Log Files:**

  * Like most web sites, WizIQ uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file saved on your computer to allow WizIQ to recognize you as a user whenever you return to our site using the same computer and web browser. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies you will not be able to use our website. Like the information that you enter during registration or in your profile, in the cookie and in the log file data is used to customize your experience on the web site.
  * One type of cookie, known as a “persistent” cookie, is set once you have logged into your WizIQ account. The next time you visit the WizIQ web site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing user and thus you need not login to use the service. In order to access or change any of your private information (like a credit card number), you must login with your password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie. Additionally, if you log out of the WizIQ site in any of your visits you will be prompted to input your password to log in to your WizIQ account. Another type of cookie, called a “session” cookie, is used to identify your particular visit to the WizIQ site. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.
  * Complying with the communication standards on the Internet, we automatically receive the URLs of the sites you previously surfed and moved on while your visit to WizIQ site. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the name of your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the WizIQ service. The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is never shared with third-parties without your permission or except when required by law.



### 3\. Information Sharing

#### Sharing Information With Third Parties:

WizIQ takes the privacy of its users very seriously. We will never sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to any third party or parties for marketing purposes. We will only share this information with third parties to carry out your instructions and to provide you specific services.

For instance, we use the services of a credit card processing company to bill our users for subscription fees. These third parties do not retain, share, or store this personally identifiable information or its part other than a purpose to provide these services and are bound by strict confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information.

WizIQ offers a “web profile” feature which allows users to publish portions of their WizIQ profile, including your “name”, but not your “email address” to the public Internet. Users may opt-out of this feature however WizIQ does not warrant how third-party search engines will update their cache.

We may provide aggregated data about the usage of our services to third-parties for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate. We may segment our users by role (i.e. students, adult learner), subject, geographic location, or by company. If you would like to be excluded from the aggregated research or products based upon aggregated data about our users’ activities on the site, please email WizIQ’s customer service.

 **Partnering with Other Organizations to Offer Combined Services:**  
WizIQ partners with other online services to give you the combined results of both services. Whenever we offer such combined services, it will always be your choice to make use of the combined services or not. In these cases, your personally identifiable information will only be passed from WizIQ to our partner if you choose to use the combined service.

 **Communications between Users:**  
Many emails you initiate through WizIQ, will list your email address and name in the header of the message. Other communications that you initiate through the WizIQ website, like a request for teacher, will list your name as the initiator but will not include your personal contact information. Your contact information will only be shared with another user if both of you have indicated your interest to establish contact with each other.
