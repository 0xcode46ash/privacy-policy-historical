## Privacy Statement for Wizards of the Coast, Inc.

### Special Note to Parents

Wizards of the Coast, Inc. ("Wizards") is very concerned about the protection of online privacy for all our website users. We are particularly respectful of the privacy of our young users. In this regard, we adhere to the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) guidelines. We do, however, still encourage parents to monitor their children's use of the Internet and to help us protect their privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information on this site or any other without permission.

Since Wizards does track and analyze certain types of data on the site, please take a moment to review our privacy policy below.

### Use of Cookies

What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to a user's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make your visit to sites easier by saving your preferences while you're at a site. They also allow us to track which parts of the web site you are most interested in visiting, allowing us to provide services and features better tailored to your needs. 

The online store uses cookies to help place and remember items you put into your shopping cart. Cookies can also be used to help retrieve shopping preferences on the Wizards site. That way, you won't have to re-enter information upon every visit to the site. Wizards does not and cannot use cookies to retrieve personal information about you from your computer unless such information was knowingly and willingly provided by you. 

### Order forms

You are not required to register in order to browse the store, but first time shoppers will be required to register as a part of the checkout process. To do so, all we need from you is your email address and a password. That creates an account for you so that if you ever have a question about an order, we can quickly help you with it. We do collect financial information (account or credit card numbers) as they relate to the purchase of products in the store. Contact information (name, phone number, and postal, e-mail and IP addresses) are collected in order to ship or get in touch with an individual regarding their purchase. We will not collect any personal information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. Examples of such information might include: name, postal address, e-mail address, and phone number. We do not sell or share any of this information with third parties. 

### Policy for Kids (Individuals under 13 years of age)

Wizards encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in activities offered on the site. No information should be submitted to or posted to Wizards by visitors under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian.

In general we have adopted the following privacy policy regarding children.

  1. We will NOT collect, use, or distribute to third parties personally identifiable information without prior verifiable parental consent. 
  2. We will NOT give the child access to unmonitored chat rooms, message boards, email accounts, or other services that would give the child the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable information without prior verifiable parental consent. In this regard, before a child can enter a contest or promotional activity the following procedure must be undertaken: 
    * A child's parent or guardian must print out a copy of a particular promotional event or content registration form. This form must be completed and signed by the parent or guardian and either mailed or faxed to Wizards in order for the child to participate.
    * When verifiable parental consent is not obtained, we will only use the online contact information (such as email) to: 
      1. Respond directly to the child's request on a one-time basis and not use that information to re-contact the child for other purposes. 
      2. Request the name or online contact information of a parent for the purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing parental notification. 
      3. Respond more than once directly to a specific request from a child (such as in the case where a child requests a newsletter subscription) and not used to re-contact the child for other purposes. We will use our best efforts to provide parental notification, which will include the nature and intended use, as well as an opportunity for the parent to prevent the use of the information and participation in the activity. 
  3. We will NOT entice the child to divulge more information than is needed to participate in any activity, game, or service. 
  4. We will provide the parent a description of the specific types of a personally identifiable information collected from their child upon request. We will allow the parent to refuse further use or future online collection of personally identifiable information and provide a way for a parent to obtain any personally identifiable information collected from their child. 
  5. We will provide notice to children in age appropriate terms of what personally identifiable information is to be collected. 
  6. We encourage children to get their parent's permission before sharing personal information online.
  7. In the event of a contest or promotion, if an applicant under the age of 13 wins, notification and prizes are sent to the parents or guardians identified in the initial registration process. Publication of content winner's names, ages, or images of children under 13 will require parental or guardian consent. 



### Opting-Out

Information provided either as a content or promotional event submission or registration from a user, who is over the age of 13, may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by Wizards. To keep you in control of your personal information and communications directed to you, we allow you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications regarding new features, services or products. If a user does not want to receive such mailings, they can either send a response to the e-mail or to the following address: webmaster@wizards.com

### Links to Other Sites

Visitors should be aware that when you are on the Wizards site, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement in one of our online publications or visit one of our fan sites, you will leave our site. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information.

Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online (message boards or chats) that information can be collected and used by individuals you do not know. While Wizards strives to protect its user's personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose on other sites and you do so at your own risk.
