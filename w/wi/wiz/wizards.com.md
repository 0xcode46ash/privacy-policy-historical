### WIZARDS WEB SITE PRIVACY STATEMENT

_Last modified August 16, 2007_

### WELCOME! 

[](https://web.archive.org/Site/LeavingWizards.aspx?url=http://www.esrb.org/confirm/wizards-confirmation.jsp) Wizards of the Coast web sites bring you the coolest information about the world of hobby gaming … Wizards of the Coast web sites bring you the latest about the world of hobby gaming, a place to meet and play with other gamers like you, and discover some of the best independent and strategy games available. If you are a parent or guardian and are interested in knowing more about Wizards’ policy regarding the online collection of information from children, we recommend reviewing the [Note To Parents](http://ww2.wizards.com/Company/Default.aspx?doc=Privacy#parents) below.

Wizards respects the privacy rights of its online visitors and is committed to providing you with a secure online environment. We have adopted an Online Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") that guides how we collect, store and use the information you provide us online.

This Privacy Statement and the certification seal located to your right confirms that Wizards is a valid licensee and participating member in the Entertainment Software Rating Board’s Privacy Online Program: ESRB Privacy Online. To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative and all our web sites have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Online to meet established online information collection and use practices. As part of this privacy program, we are subject to frequent audits of our sites and other enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by ESRB. 

Whenever you visit a web site that displays the ESRB Privacy Online certification seal, you can expect to be notified of:

  * Exactly what personal information may be collected; 
  * The consequences, if any, resulting from your refusal to provide personal information; 
  * Who, if anyone, is collecting your personal information;
  * How this information may be used, including, with whom, if anyone, it might be shared;
  * Whether a company uses cookies or tracks IP Addresses to collect information; 
  * What choices you have with regard to the use of your personal information;
  * How a company ensures data security, quality, and integrity; 
  * How you can access and, if necessary, change the personal information a company collects and maintains; 
  * Where and how to ask questions or file complaints; and, 
  * Whether and how information is collected from Children under 13.



If you have any questions, complaints, or comments regarding our privacy statement or policies, please contact the Privacy Policy Administrator at webregistration@wizards.com. For complaints, you can also contact ESRB Privacy Online directly through their [consumer hotline](http://ww2.wizards.com/Site/LeavingWizards.aspx?url=http://www.esrb.org/privacy/contact.jsp), by phone at (212) 759-0700 or by regular mail at 317 Madison Avenue, 22nd Floor, New York, NY 10017.

 **What does this Privacy Policy apply to?**

This privacy policy applies to all web sites operated by Wizards. Please note that this privacy policy applies only to information submitted and collected online through the web sites listed above, and does not apply to information that may be collected by Wizards offline. In addition, this Privacy Policy applies only to sites operated by Wizards from its offices within the State of Washington, United States of America ("US"), and not to web sites operated by our international affiliates (e.g., Wizards UK) or other companies or organizations to which we link. When you link to any other sites from one of Wizards' US web sites, this policy no longer applies and Wizards does not control the activities of those sites.

 **What information does Wizards collect?**

Wizards wants to give you the most exciting Internet experience possible. To help us figure out what you like and don't like about our sites, we may ask for your opinion from time to time. Wizards may request and/or collect information from you on a voluntary basis when you:

  * create a profile to participate in Wizards or Gleemax community features 
  * shop at one of our affiliate online stores
  * give credit card information to make purchases from our web site
  * enter a shipping and billing address when making a purchase
  * participate in contests, events, or promotions
  * send questions or comments via e-mail to Wizards customer service
  * submit your resume to us online
  * fill out online surveys



The requested information may include personal information such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number, and home address. In addition, we may request demographic information such as your age, the gender and birth dates of children in your household, and toy and game ownership and preferences.

If you are under the age of 13, some features of the web sites may be unavailable to you. For others, you will need your parent or guardian's consent before you can provide any personal information to us for purposes of registration and other online activities. Kids, if you are ever unsure about anything you are seeing on this site, ask your parent or guardian for help. See [Note To Parents](http://ww2.wizards.com/Company/Default.aspx?doc=Privacy#parents) below for more information.

  *  **Wizards.com and Gleemax.com Chat, Forums, Blogs and Comments, and Discussion Lists**  
All free interactive community activities are moderated. For those activities available to registered users under 13 years of age, parents or guardians may request that the registration be disallowed. Personal information of registered users is not accessible by the public unless the user exposes it in his or her account profile or it is disclosed by the user himself or herself in a public post. 
  * **Online Stores**  
Visitors purchasing goods and services through one of our affiliate online stores will need to provide a valid credit card number and expiration date, in addition to name, mailing address, phone number and e-mail address. 
  * **Promotions**  
To participate in some of our promotions, you may be asked to provide an e-mail address or screen name, so that we can let you know if you won a prize. Please do not use your real name for these promotions. For other Wizards promotions, we may request your name and home address in order to send you products or information by regular mail.
  *  **E-mail**  
By allowing you to send e-mail to us, we are not attempting to collect any personal information about you. We will only use personal information (such as name, mailing address and e-mail address) contained in your e-mail to respond to your specific inquiry or comments in the e-mail. Although we may retain your e-mail for a period of time, we will not use any personal information contained in your e-mail for any purpose other than responding to your specific inquiry or comments.
  *  **Web Postcards**  
By allowing you to send postcards or pages to friends, we are not attempting to collect any personal information about you or the person you are e-mailing. We will use the personal information supplied (such as name and e-mail address) only to send the postcard or page as you request and allow the recipient to respond to you.
  *  **Resumes**  
Some of our web sites allow for the online submission of resumes. Personal information collected from resumes is not subject to this Privacy Policy. However, we can assure you that such information will be used solely for the purpose of accepting and evaluating candidate submissions for job postings.
  *  **Online Surveys**  
In order to improve the user experience at our web sites, we may employ online surveys for visitors to volunteer anonymous demographic information about themselves and provide us feedback about why they visit our sites and what we can do to make them better. Information collected through these surveys is anonymous; we cannot identify who is submitting the information or tie it to other personally identifiable information a user may have provided us through another means.



Whatever the activity may be, we will only collect information to the extent it is reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives. If you do not want to submit personal information when requested, you will not be able to access certain areas on our web sites. However, you do not need to provide personal information to Wizards in order to use our web sites.

 **Who is collecting my information and how will it be used?**

Wizards collects the personal information you provide on our sites. We may use the information you submit to our Web sites to send you advertising or promotional materials, including information about new products, contests, features and enhancements, special offers and other events of interest. We may also use your personal information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the products and services we provide you and can better meet your needs. The demographic information (e.g., age and gender) you provide us is collected by Wizards and may be disclosed in aggregate to third parties. This aggregate demographic information cannot be used to personally identify you or your computer.

Third parties that advertise through or serve ads on our web sites may gather non-personally identifying data about the advertisements you viewed and the web site pages that interest you through the use of cookies and clear GIFs (these technologies are described below). This information helps advertisers determine which kinds of advertisements you might prefer. Wizards’ privacy policy does not cover the policies or practices of these third parties. Visitors should consult the third parties’ privacy notices.

 **With whom does Wizards share my personal information?**

Wizards may share your personal information with outside entities hired to assist with internal web site support operations (e.g., online product fulfillment, e-mail services, or technical support). These web sites will not use your personal information for any other purpose, and have agreed to maintain confidentiality, surveys, security, and integrity of all the personal information they obtain from us. 

We may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, including but not limited to disclosure to law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability.

Wizards, as a subsidiary of Hasbro, Inc. does not sell, rent, or otherwise disclose personal information collected from and about its users (including children under 13) to third parties. However, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, Wizards' customer information may be transferred to Wizards' successor or assign, if permitted by and done in accordance with applicable law.

 **Clear GIFs, Cookies and IP Addresses**

Clear GIFs, sometimes called "web bugs" or “pixel tags,” are file objects, usually a graphic image such as a transparent one pixel-by-one pixel GIF (Graphics Interchange Format, one of the two most common file formats for images on the Web), that are placed on a Web page or in an e-mail message to monitor user behavior. The GIF tells us the IP address of the computer that fetched our page, the URL of the page the GIF is on, the time the page was viewed, the type of browser used, and it can also identify a previously set cookie value. This anonymous information is returned by the clear GIF to Wizards and we use this information to accurately count visitors across our web sites and understand how they navigate and use our network of web sites. Wizards does not combine information gathered through clear GIFs with your personal information.

Wizards uses "cookies" to enhance your experience at our web sites. Cookies are pieces of information that we place on your computer to help us accurately understand how many consumers are visiting a particular site, how often they visit that site and what content they are most interested in viewing. For example, a cookie will allow us to remember certain things based on your Internet Protocol or "IP" address (an IP address is the string of numbers that identifies each sender or receiver of information that is sent across the Internet), such as the time and duration of your visits, how you navigated through our content and where you exited a particular site. 

Wizards' web sites collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our web sites. When visitors request pages on one of our web sites, our servers log the visitors' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our community rules [Code of Conduct](http://ww2.wizards.com/default.asp?x=community/coc) or posted [Legal Notice](http://ww2.wizards.com/company/WebSiteLegalNotice.asp), or to protect our services, web sites, customers, or others. 

**Log Files**

Other information passively collected by Wizards is in the form of logs -- files that record web site activity and gather statistics about web users' browsing habits. These entries are generated anonymously, and help Wizards determine (among other things) how many and how often users have visited our web sites, which pages they've visited, and other similar data. We also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you. 

**Linking to third party sites**

To provide relevant information not found on our web sites and to facilitate online shopping, Wizards may provide links from our web sites to third party web sites. We encourage our users to read third party sites' privacy policies before submitting personal information.

 **Opt-out**

If you do not want Wizards to send you e-mail or regular mail about our products and/or services, you can opt-out at the time of registration or at the time of information collection. If you are receiving e-mails or regular mail and at a later date you choose to opt-out and have your name removed from Wizards' e-mail list, you can do so by using the link included with a Wizards e-mail or by sending an e-mail to webregistration@wizards.com.

 **Safeguarding your personal information**

Wizards will only collect personal information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to serve our legitimate business purposes, and we will take appropriate steps to ensure the security and integrity of any information you provide to us. Any information provided to us is housed in a secure datacenter, accessible by limited Wizards personnel.

 **Review, update and removal of personal information**

If you have registered with our site, you may at any time review and/or update the contact information we have for you or inform us that you want us to remove your information from our database by contacting us at webregistration@wizards.com. Please be sure to include in your message the name of the feature for which you registered and the e-mail address you used to register so that we can verify your request.

 **Your California Privacy Rights**

Beginning on January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of Wizards who are California residents to request certain information regarding its disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not share our customer’s personal information with unaffiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. 

To make such a request, please send an e-mail to webregistration@wizards.com or write to the address below.

### NOTE TO PARENTS

Wizards has developed its web sites to be an enjoyable experience for children (and adults) of all ages. Wizards recognizes that some younger children may not understand some of the information contained on the web sites or how the web sites operate. That is the purpose of the Privacy Statement. Please discuss this statement with your children so that they will better understand how to use the web sites and the information they may be asked to provide. Wizards strongly believes that providing its visitors with accurate and adequate notice about the web sites will lead to informed choices and decisions about how to use the web sites, as well as protect its users' privacy. If you have any questions or comments about our policy, please contact us using the Contact Information provided below. For all other issues, please contact [Wizards Customer Service](http://ww2.wizards.com/Site/LeavingWizards.aspx?url=http://wizards.custhelp.com).

 **Teenagers (Ages 13-17)**

Wizards may collect personal information from users over 13 and under 18 ("teenager"). When a web site user in this age category submits personal information, Wizards may request a parent or guardian's e-mail address to notify the parent or guardian of the teenager's activity. Personal information collected from these visitors is subject to the policies set forth above.

 **Children Under 13**

 **Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information**

Wizards may collect and store personal information about children under 13 ("children" or "child") if it is submitted by way of our registration form and with the parent's or legal guardian’s verifiable consent. To determine who is younger than 13 years old and whether parental consent is required, we ask all users who wish to register to submit their date of birth. Those users that indicate they are under 13 years of age are directed to a Parental Consent Form. If given verifiable permission from a parent or legal guardian, Wizards may collect and store the following types of personal information about a child under 13: name, e-mail address, mailing address, parent's or legal guardian's name, and parent's or legal guardian's email address. Wizards may also collect demographic information about a child such as the child's date of birth, gender, and other preferences; and, combine such information with the child's personal information. Wizards will only collect this information if it is voluntarily submitted to us by the child or parent/ legal guardian and provided with the parent's or legal guardian’s signed permission. We do not gather personal information about a child through the use of passive collection mechanisms such as cookies. For more information on how we use cookies and other information collection tools, please see our section on cookies (provided above).

The information that a child provides on his/her registration form may be used to: (a) allow the child to participate in activities on our web sites (e.g., contests); and, (b) allow us to send the child promotional materials, including information about new products, contests, features and enhancements, special offers, and other events of interest.

Wizards may share kids' personal information with outside entities hired to assist with internal website support operations (e.g., online product fulfillment, e-mail services, or technical support). These entities will not use kids' personal information for any other purpose, and have agreed to maintain confidentiality, surveys, security, and integrity of all the personal information they obtain from us.

We may also use the information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so that we can constantly improve the products and services we provide our visitors and to better meet their needs.

Please note that we are prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an activity - like contests - on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. To read about the steps Wizards takes to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of children's personal information, please see our section on "Safeguarding your personal information" (above).

In some instances, certain portions of our web sites (e.g., electronic postcards) will allow children under 13 to submit personal information such as their e-mail addresses without first obtaining their parents' or legal guardians’ consent. Such portions of our web sites operate activities or provide services in a way that does not require prior parental consent under the law.

 **Disclosure of Children's Personal Information**

Please read the section titled "With whom does Wizards share my personal information" (above) for our policy on the disclosure of personal information collected from and about children under 13.

 **Parental Access**

A parent who has already given Wizards permission to collect and use his or her child’s personal information can, at any time review, correct, or have deleted the child's personal information or discontinue further collection and use of the child's personal information. To do so, please contact us at webregistration@wizards.com and be sure to include the following:

* Your child's name and e-mail address
* Your name and e-mail address
* The name of the feature for which your child is registered

We will be happy to honor your request.
