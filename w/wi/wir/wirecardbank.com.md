# WIRECARD BANK: Privacy Policy | wirecardbank.com

Wirecard Bank AG offer products and services for electronic payments and risk management as well as individual financial solutions to its customers. Our aim is inter alia to enable companies and consumers to process electronic payments worldwide smoothly and easily. The security and protection of personal data is one of the most important aspects in processing payments. This is why Wirecard Bank AG ensures compliance with the legal provisions on privacy, in particular in accordance with the provisions of the German Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the German Teleservices Act (TMG). This statement covers all key aspects of data privacy. Please note the following information.

### **General information**

This website provides information on the services offered by Wirecard Bank AG. Wirecard Bank AG also offers a personal area for banking operations (e-banking) with restricted access for the respective customers only. 

### **Data Controller**

Wirecard Bank AG with its business address at Einsteinring 35, 85609 Aschheim, Germany, is the Data Controller as defined by the BDSG. 

Customers remain Data Controller for all data processed by Wirecard Bank AG or by other affiliates of the Wirecard Group as part of contracted data processing on behalf of such customers. Wirecard Bank AG as Data Processor will refer to the respective customer(s) in the event of any queries regarding this data.

### **Anonymous page view**

As a rule, pages of the Wirecard Bank AG website can be viewed anonymously. Data that is collected automatically (see below) is anonymized prior to being stored and processed. 

### **Collection and process of personal data**

Wirecard Bank AG processes payment information on behalf of its customers (merchants) as part of payment processing and related services (e.g. risk management). Particularly in its role as a Data Processor, Wirecard Bank AG works through its affiliated customers towards compliance with the principle of data efficiency as defined under the BDSG. 

The affiliated customer (merchant) concerned is considered as the Data Controller for processed payment data. Sensitive data in particular, such as credit card numbers and account details, are processed as part of payment processing. This data is encrypted and stored in the Wirecard Bank AG databases in compliance with PCI DSS regulations. 

The data processed on behalf of an affiliated customer (merchant) is processed only for the purpose requested by this customer – e.g. payment processing and risk management. Depending on the contracted service, additional information, such as IP geolocation data and credit reports may also be consulted. 

Any and all data processed on behalf of a customer will be stored as specified by the customer and also deleted at the customer's request – at the latest, however, following expiry of the applicable statutory periods imposed by law. In the event that a customer requests removal of her data before expiry of the applicable statutory period, the data will usually be blocked instead of being deleted. 

### **Disclosure of personal data**

Wirecard Bank AG will process personal data only as requested by its affiliated customers (merchants). This data is disclosed exclusively to subcontractors of Wirecard Bank AG for the purpose of completing the transaction. This data may be disclosed to relevant service providers, e.g. credit rating agencies, for the purpose of identity verification and fraud prevention. The data will not be disclosed to other third parties – e.g. for the purpose of selling addresses. 

### **Right of revocation concerning the collection, processing and use of personal data**

The customer may revoke her consent to the collection, processing and utilization of personal data at any time with effect for the future. The revocation shall be addressed to the aforementioned Data Controller. 

Please note that Wirecard Bank AG may not be able to perform certain services in the event of such a revocation. 

### **Automatically collected non-personal data.**

This includes the IP address, pages visited on the site, data and time of visit, cookies, and information regarding the visitor's browser, operating system and language settings. On the basis of this non-personal data user profiles are created using a pseudonym. Cookies may be used for this purpose (please refer to the definition of the term “Cookies” below under the respective headline). These data are processed only in pseudonymous form. This especially applies for the IP-address which is processed and stored only abbreviated i.e. without the last two number blocks. The data collected will not be used to personally identify the customer and will not be merged with personal data about the bearer of the pseudonym without the express permission of the respective individual. As soon as the storage of the data is no longer necessary for the creation of the user profile, they will be deleted. 

For the processing of the non-personal data, Wirecard Bank AG uses the technologies of the etracker GmbH ([www.etracker.com](http://www.etracker.com/)).

### **Right of revocation concerning the collection, processing and utilization of non-personal data**
