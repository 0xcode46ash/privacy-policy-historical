**Children’s Privacy Policy**

This section of the Privacy Policy provides Wired’s policy for the collection and use of personal  
information about children under the Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”).

Under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, a “child” is anyone under thirteen (13) years  
of age and “personal information” is defined as individually identifiable information, such as a  
first and last name; a home or other physical address including street name and city or town; an  
e-mail address; a telephone number; a social security number; or persistent identifiers such as  
customer or processor serial numbers held in a cookie, where the identifier is associated with  
individually identifiable information. Wired normally does not collect personal information as  
defined under COPPA from children under the age of thirteen (13). We collect and use only  
as much information about a child as necessary, and do not condition use of the sites on the  
disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary.

Wired contacts children by e-mail only in response to their requests for information. Wired uses  
cookies solely for the purpose of holding information during online sessions (such as tracking  
items placed in the shopping cart for purchase with parental consent). If, however, a child  
voluntarily discloses personal information, such as a name or e-mail address, on any part of a  
site that is accessible to other users, then such information could be collected and disclosed by  
others. Wired is not responsible for such collection or disclosure.

Wired requires parental consent before collecting, using, or disclosing certain personal  
information from children as required by COPPA. Parental consent must be demonstrated  
through use of a valid credit card to create an order from Wired or by contacting Wired. Parents  
may review and have their child’s personal information deleted from Wired’s records, and  
may refuse to permit further collection or use of their child’s information by contacting Wired.  
Wired’s agent for COPPA information requests is [please fill in agent contact information]  
. Parents may consent to our collection and use of their child’s personal information without  
consenting to the disclosure of that information to others.

Wired treats personal information collected from children in the same manner as it treats any  
other Personal Information under the Privacy Policy listed above. Without verified parental  
consent, Wired will not knowingly collect personal information relating to children under  
thirteen (13) years of age, and if we learn that we inadvertently collected such information, it will  
be promptly deleted.
