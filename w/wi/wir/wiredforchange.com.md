# Privacy Policy

### Introduction

Salsa Labs and all affiliated services respect each individual's right to personal privacy. We will not share your information with any third-party organization without your explicit permission to do so. Personal information you provide is stored in a secure location and is accessible only by designated staff. We will collect and use information through our Web site only in the ways disclosed in this statement.

### Information Collection and Usage

Salsa Labs collects two types of information: optional and/or voluntary information that users provide; and information that is automatically recorded in a standard, web server log file each time a page request is made.

Optional and/or voluntary information is provided by users when they take action on a member organization's campaign, donation, signup or other page created with the Salsa platform. This information belongs to the member organization and will not be used by Salsa Labs for any purpose other than aggregate statistics.

Some Salsa Labs services offer electronic newsletters and other publications to subscribers. We may also use this information to send emails regarding new services or features, or to send system alerts or other pertinent information. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we always present the option to unsubscribe from our communications.

Salsa Labs clients, partners and member organizations have all agreed to adhere to our strict privacy policy and will not share with a third party any personally identifiable information gathered through Salsa without the express consent of users.

We do not collect personally identifying information that users divulge about other people, such as the information provided in our tell-a-friend feature.

We do not actively market to children, and we never knowingly ask a child under 13 to divulge personal information.

We may collect demographic data through automatic logging files in order to enhance the usefulness of our site.

### Cookies

A "cookie" is a small file assigning you a unique ID that is placed on your computer by a web server. Salsa Labs' web site uses cookies within our action centers in order to identify return visitors and make it easier to take action. We may also from time to time use cookies on the homepage so that frequent visitors are not presented a pop-up window each time they visit.

### Linking

We offer links to other websites. Please note: When you click on links to other websites, we encourage you to read their privacy policies. Their standards may differ from ours.

Our website will offer forums and message boards. Please be advised that information posted in these venues becomes public knowledge.

### Access to Information

Users may access their own personal information and contact us about inaccuracies they may find. Users may delete their information or edit their personal profile. Subscribers can remove their names from our subscriber list at any time.

### Problem Resolution

If problems arise, users may contact the support, billing or service points of their vendor entity. We strive to resolve disputes within 72 hours.

### Data Storage and Security

The data we gather from users is stored on our servers along with everything else on our servers, and the same security measures protect users' data as protect our own internal data.

We use industry-standard methods to protect the confidentiality and integrity of personal information. While there is no such thing as "perfect security" anywhere on the Internet, we protect your data just as we protect our own. Furthermore, access to personal data is restricted within the company, and all employees are aware that personal data is private.

### Your Choice to Opt Out

Salsa Labs and all affiliated entities provide users the opportunity to opt out of receiving communications from us in every message we send.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time.
