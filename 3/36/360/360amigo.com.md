360Amigo collects your Personal Information at a variety of points, including when you place an order, (which may require you to provide personal information, including a credit card number, to our commerce provider), register software, request services or take part in other activities on our Web site. For example, we often ask for your Personal Information when you are conferring with one of our customer support technicians, downloading a new product or program update, registering your software or purchasing a product. During these interactions we will collect Personal Information relevant to your transacting with 360Amigo, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, e-mail address, shipping address and credit card information along with information about the 360Amigo products you own, such as the activation code or key code, date of purchase and information relating to a support issue. We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. When you register, you will be provided with an option to opt-out of receiving promotional information on our products and services. Please be aware that if you prefer not to provide us with your Personal Information, because such information may be necessary for us to provide certain services, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, make such services available to you.

## Surveys and Contests

From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you.

The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and email address), and demographic information (such as zip code).

We use this information to monitor site traffic and personalize the site, and to notify contest winners and award prizes.  
We may continue to use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company is prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose.

## 360Amigo’s Commitment to Data Security

360Amigo has security measures in place, such as the following, to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your Personal Information in our customer database. Personal Information provided to 360Amigo is stored in secure facilities with access restricted to authorized personnel only. We have put in place a series of access-control procedures required for retrieval of personal information. The 360Amigo Web site is regularly tested for security breaches to protect against unauthorized viewing of Personal Information.

To provide secure credit card processing when ordering, orders placed on our Web site are processed through a payment gateway which operates under its own privacy policy.

360Amigo DOES NOT store credit card information. 360Amigo does not handle financial transactions via the Web, so it has no need for streaming encryption products. 360Amigo works with a third party to serve as a trusted intermediary to handle e-commerce transactions with our customers. Our commerce partner handles e-commerce on a secure server which encrypts all of our customers’ personal information. To learn more about how our commerce partners manages the privacy of information in conjunction with these e-commerce transactions, please see their complete Privacy Statement. If at any time you would like to make a purchase, but do not want to provide your credit card information online, you may contact a support representative at [sales@360Amigo.com](mailto:sales@360Amigo.com).

Although we make good faith efforts to store the Personal Information we collect in a secure operating environment that is not accessible to unauthorized users, we cannot guarantee complete security.
