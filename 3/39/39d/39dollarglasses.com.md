###  Privacy Policy 

  
**PRIVACY**

**Does your website share information it receives?**

We are committed to protecting your privacy. **We do not sell, trade, or otherwise distribute our customers’ personal information to any third party.** We collect only the minimum amount of information required to complete your order. This includes your shipping and billing information; your contact information (phone number & email address); and your prescription information. If you were referred to us from another website we may share information about the time of and amount of your purchase. No one is given your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, or any identifiable personal information; no personal information about you is given from our website or company. 

**E–Mails**

If you provide our website with your e-mail address, you may receive e-mails from us including order confirmation, shipping confirmation for your order(s), and occasional promotions and specials. If you do not want to receive marketing or promotional e-mails from us, a link is provided on any internal marketing email we may send. 

**Cookies**

Cookies are bits of computer code that tell a website that you have been there before. They are used on almost all e-commerce websites to enhance your browsing and shopping experience. Cookies save information critical for placing orders, such as memorizing what items have been placed in your shopping cart. Without them, your cart would simply empty as soon as you went to another page. Cookies also allow us to change link colors so users will see which links they have already clicked. You can disable cookies in the Help portion of your browser toolbar. However, you will not be able to order until cookies are re-enabled. It is our recommendation that you do not disable cookies when browsing this website. 

**SECURITY AND PROTECTION**

**We are committed to Data Security and Protection**

We have installed all appropriate technological safeguards to keep all information completely secure. 

**Secure Sockets Layering (SSL)**

Our website uses Secure Sockets Layering (SSL) technology, the industry standard, to encrypt credit card information, before it is carried over the web. As a result, your encrypted information is as safe and secure as placing an online order on our website is as safe as placing a phone order. Our SSL encryption is implemented and monitored 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, through **Thawte™**. 

**HackerSafe**

We use ScanAlert™ HACKER SAFE security to preemptively test for any vulnerabilities every single day. Your information is secure. 

**Children's Protection**

We support and are in full compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). **We will never knowingly communicate with, collect information from, or accept purchases from children under 13 years old.** If you believe your child has communicated with us, please contact us and we will delete any and all of this information from our records.
