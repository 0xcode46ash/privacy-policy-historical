# Privacy | 350.org

**General Policy:** The 350 campaign has a firm commitment to internet privacy. You can visit most portions of 350.org without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. The only information we collect from a normal web site visit is the name of your internet service provider, the browser and type of machine you are using, the web site that referred you to us, the pages you request and the date and time you request them.

**How We Use the Information:** We use this information to generate statistics and measure site activity in order to improve the quality of our site to our visitors. We do encourage you to voluntarily share your email address and other personally identifiable information with us, because we can’t build the movement we need to win the fight against global warming without you. All such information is collected and stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of the data.

**Security:** The 350 campaign makes every effort to insure the secure collection and transmission of sensitive user information using industry accepted data collection and encryption methodologies. If you choose to make a donation to 350, your credit card information will be used only for this transaction through our secure online payment system. 350 does not retain credit card information or transmit credit card information to anyone else. The 350 campaign does not sell or otherwise disclose such user information outside the organization.

**Updates and Sharing of Information:** If you sign up to receive updates from 350, we commit to ensuring that we provide you accurate and timely information about our campaign activities. While the vast majority of communications will come to you direct from 350. From time to time, some information on our lists, such as your name and address, may be exchanged with other trusted 350 allies organizing 350 events in your areas, for example. We will not share your information with anyone who is not engaged in ensuring the success of the 350 campaign, or anyone who lacks a robust privacy policy.  You may opt out of our this communication at any time via the unsubscribe link at the bottom of each email we send.

Cookies: Like most websites, 350 may place a "cookie," or small file, in the browser files of a visitor’s computer. We use cookies to save information you give us so that you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. This allows us to personalize the site to your taste and provide the best web experience possible to our visitors. 

**Updating the Privacy Policy:** 350 does reserve the right to change its policy as necessary to support the campaign; this privacy policy statement will always remain updated.
