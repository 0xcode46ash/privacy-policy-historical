We may collect Personal Information, including your e-mail address, name, postal address, telephone number, certain types of demographic information, and information about your computer hardware and software. We may also combine Personal Information you provide to us with publicly available information, such as your organization’s name.

We use your Personal Information for the operation of service, to fulfill your requests, to send you important information regarding the Site, to improve the quality of the Site, and for general usage statistics. We may use your Personal Information to inform you of products, services, and promotions. We may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services.

We may share Personal Information with our trusted partners who work on our behalf. These partners may use your Personal Information to help 3Play Media communicate with you about offers from 3Play Media.

3Play Media may work with ad networks that display targeted advertisements based on Personal Information. These ad networks may make inferences based on this information in order to provide targeted ads to people who meet the targeting criteria. They may also collect and aggregate information about you and use that information to serve targeted ads to you. You can opt out of targeted advertising through the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI). Clicking [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/#completed) will allow you to opt out of seeing targeted ads from us and from other NAI approved member companies.

If you provide us with Personal Information, you have the right to review the information for correctness, request correction of errors, request that the information not be used to contact you, request that the information be deleted from our records, and to opt out of being solicited by us.

## Disclosure of Personal Information

We do not sell, rent or lease Personal Information to third parties. We may disclose Personal Information to third party service providers who need the information to provide us with components of the Site or our products and services. This may include website hosting, data analysis, payment processing, order fulfillment, infrastructure provision, IT services, customer service and email delivery services.

We will disclose your Personal Information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to a law or comply with legal process served on us; (b) protect and defend the rights or our property (including enforcing this agreement); and (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.

## Cookies

The Site may use cookies to help you personalize your online experience. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience all of the features of the Site. The use of cookies is standard practice on the Internet and is done by many websites. 

We may also use cookies, tracking pixels and related technologies to improve the site, communicate with you, and provide targeted advertising to you. You can opt out of seeing targeted advertising by clicking [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/#completed).

## Web Beacons

We or service providers acting on our behalf may use web beacons in our advertisements and in our emails. Web beacons help us to track usage and performance of the Site.

## IP Addresses

The Site may keep logs of your IP address whenever you visit, along with the times of your visits and the pages you visited. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites.

## Payment Processing

We use a third party payment service to process credit card payments for products and services provided by us. When you provide credit card information on the Site, that information is sent directly to the payment service. We do not have access to your full credit card number and do not store that information. You acknowledge and agree that any Personal Information that you provide in connection with your credit card payments will be transmitted directly to the payment service. Information transmitted to the payment service is encrypted using SSL software and the payment service is required to comply with all applicable privacy and security laws and the rules and regulations issued by the credit card companies. However, we are not responsible for the payment service’s failure to comply with such laws, rules and regulations.

## Use of Our Publishing Tools

The Site enables certain 3Play Media customers to publish searchable transcripts and closed captions to a customer’s own website or to third party websites. Please note that any information you disclose may become public information and may be available to visitors to the website where they are posted and to the general public. Please exercise discretion and caution if you choose to publish your content. We are not responsible for the use of any Personal Information you disclose through your use of the 3Play Media publishing tools.

## Use of Our Forums

The Site includes message boards, forums, chat functionality, profile pages, and blogs to which you are able to post information and materials (collectively referred to as the “Forums”). Please note that any information you disclose through the Forums may be available to visitors to the Site and to the general public. Please exercise discretion and caution while using the Forums. We are not responsible for the use of any Personal Information you disclose through your use of the Forums.

## Security

We use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect Personal Information under our control from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. We restrict access to Personal Information to users who need it and to a reasonable amount of time. If we share your Personal Information with a third party we require that company to protect the information and to not use it for any other purpose. When we collect or transmit sensitive information such as a credit card number, we use industry standard methods to protect that information.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please contact us immediately if you believe that your communication with us has been compromised.

## Other Notices Regarding Privacy

We retain Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is permitted or required by law.

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy without prior notice. You can find out when this Privacy Policy was last revised by referring to the “Last Updated” legend at the top of this page.
