In order to register for 3P Learning resources, students registering individually and not part of a school, must give their consent (or if they are under 13 years of age a parent or guardian must consent on their behalf) at the time of registration to provide us with their name, age, and their email address.

Teachers registering for their class or school must give their consent at the time of registration to provide us with their own name, class name, school name and their email address. In addition, teachers must consent for their students to participate at the time of registration and provide us with the names of their students.

Registrants who do not give this consent cannot provide us with their personal information or the names of the students and cannot use the Site.

  *  __

We require this information in order to correctly identify each Registrant as a Site user, manage their account and for certain other purposes detailed below.




 **What we will do with your information**

In addition, we may notify our Registrants of new products and services that 3P Learning has designed and made available to the Registrants. In all communications, Registrants may opt out at any time by following the specific opt out instructions within the communications that we send.

We will require these third parties to comply strictly with our instructions and we will require that they do not have access to your personal information and not use the data for commercial purposes.

 **How long we hold your information**

  * __

We will keep any personal information we collect from Registrants for as long as they are registered users of the Site. If a Registrant cancels their registration or it otherwise lapses after 3 years of not using the Site, we will only keep their personal information for the purposes of sending the Registrant information regarding 3P Learning’s other products and services if they agree to receive this information. Personal information is otherwise deleted or destroyed.




 **Keeping your personal information accurate**

  * __

The personal information we hold about a Registrant (such as their name, address and school) is kept so that we may correctly identify that Registrant. Registrants can update their personal information at anytime by contacting 3P Learning (details below).

However, security cannot be guaranteed due to the nature of the internet.

3P Learning’s security measures are designed to assist in Registrants’ personal information not being accessed by unauthorised personnel, lost or misused.

 **Anonymous information**

  * __

In addition to personal information and results data, 3P Learning also collects anonymous information about Registrants and the activities of Registrants on the Site. Anonymous information is information that is not linked to the name of a user. This information is used to assist us in enhancing the learning resources and the information remains anonymous at all times.

  *  __

When agreeing to the Site Terms and Conditions, Registrants grant 3P Learning the right to use this anonymous information for its own purposes, such as the preparation of statistical reports, provided 3P Learning otherwise complies with its obligations in respect of the use of personal information.

We will correct or delete inaccurate or incomplete personal information we hold about you at your request.




 **Public Displays of Names**

  * __
