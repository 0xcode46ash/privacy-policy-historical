Third-party websites

3 Interactive is not responsible for the methods by websites or applications that contain links on the website or are linked to its website nor the contact and information presented therein. Third-party Internet sites and services accessible through 3 Interactive have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of 3 Interactive. 3 Interactive has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions.

Disclosure of personal information is not shared with anyone outside of 3 Interactive, unless specifically stated otherwise. 3 Interactive does not sell, rent or lease such personal information collected on the site to non-affiliated third parties without your consent. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than 3 Interactive or an agent for 3 Interactive, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer.

3 Interactive may share voluntarily-provided personally identifiable information (i) to enable third party service providers to assist or facilitate in the services 3 Interactive provides; (ii) to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information 3 Interactive receives, whether or not a response is required by applicable law, and to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the Terms of Access, or as otherwise required by law; (iii) to enforce an agreement or to protect 3 Interactive's rights; with any parent, affiliated or successor entity; (iv) in connection with any asset sale, transfer, divestiture or liquidation; (v) in connection with strategic alliances, partnerships or other business arrangements to permit the offering of products or services 3 Interactive believes may be of interest to you or where 3 Interactive has determined that the information will be used in a responsible manner by the third party; or (vi) as permitted under any agreement with you. 3 Interactive may also share aggregated data with others. Aggregated data does not include personally identifiable information. Except as provided 3 Interactive will not share any of your information with any third party without your permission.

Collection of "Non-PII" (Non-Personally Identifiable Information) and Cookies

This website uses Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the site. The tool uses "cookies," which are text files placed on your computer, to collect standard Internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including IP address) is transmitted to Google. This information is then used to evaluate visitors' use of the website and to compile statistical reports on website activity for 3 Interactive.

We will never (and will not allow any third party to) use the statistical analytics tool to track or to collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of visitors to our site. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. Neither we nor Google will link, or seek to link, an IP address with the identity of a computer user. We will not associate any data gathered from this site with any Personally Identifiable Information from any source, unless you explicitly submit that information via a fill-in form on our website.

If you are a parent and are aware that your child has provided 3 Interactive with PII without your knowledge or consent, please contact us immediately at [privacy@3interactive.net](mailto:privacy@3interactive.net).
