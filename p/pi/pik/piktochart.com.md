# Piktochart's Privacy Policy » Piktochart Infographics

Your privacy is of utmost importance to us, and we would like to inform you about our policy for protecting your privacy online. As a business, we DO collect information from you, and we do it in two ways: Information we get from your usage of the system (see Google Analytics) and information you give us (see Social Media).

The information collected from site will then be transmitted to Google, which then compiles statistical reports based on user activity. All the data is aggregated and cannot be tracked down individually.
