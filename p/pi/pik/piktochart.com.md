Your privacy is of utmost importance to us, and we would like to inform you about our policy for protecting your privacy online. As a business, we DO collect information from you, and we do it in two ways: Information we get from your usage of the system (see Google Analytics) and information you give us (see Social Media).

## Google Analytics

   
We collect data using [Google Analytics](http://google.com/analytics "Google Analytics"). We use it to analyze how users use this site, and make decisions to improve the website.

The information collected from site will then be transmitted to Google, which then compiles statistical reports based on user activity. All the data is aggregated and cannot be tracked down individually.

We will never share this data with any third party. Google does not associate your information with any other data held by Google. Neither will we nor Google link or seek to link the collected anonymized information with the identity of the user.

## Piktochart Infographics

   
The Piktochart infographics you create on the server are safe with us. They can be accessed at any point only by you. We may for troubleshooting purposes, ask you to access your account from the back end but that would only give us access to the infographic output without the ability to edit it on your account. We will also never ask for your password.
