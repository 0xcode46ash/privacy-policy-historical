# P i g s b a c k.com - Privacy Policy

Safeguarding your privacy is our number one priority. 

Because we gather some information about Pigsback.com members, we believe you should understand how that information might be used.

Here is our commitment to you:

  * We will protect your confidentiality. 
  * We will NEVER release or sell your personal information to any other party. 
  * When we give information to the companies that participate in the Programme, it is in the form of grouped statistics based on members' information while participating in the Programme. The information typically includes the total number of visits, where are they coming from, what do they do on the website, etc. The Programme is designed to make it impossible for outside companies to extract personal information without your consent. 
  * We follow rigorous security protocols within our company to safeguard any personal information you share with us.
