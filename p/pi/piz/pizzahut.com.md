Company adheres to the federal privacy protection standards articulated in the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). 

On the sections of the Site directed towards children, Company does not collect Personal Information online from children under 13 without their parent's consent, except to respond to email as described below. Company may collect information that is not Personal Information in special, limited circumstances, as described below. If a child is under 13 and wants to use the children's sites with special activities, like scavenger hunts, personalized pages or clubs, Company might ask the child to "register" by giving Us a user name and his/her state of residence. When asking for a child's user name, the child is encouraged to use a "screen name" (not his/her real name) that only the child knows. Sometimes the child will be asked to make up a special password so that only they can see their customized areas on the site. 

With parent's verifiable consent, Company may collect personal information from a child such as a full name or an e-mail address when the information is necessary for a particular activity. A parent can provide verifiable consent to Company by printing a [permission form](https://web.archive.org/web/20090606031626id_/http%3A//www.pizzahut.com/Files/Docs/Pizza%20Hut%20Permission%20Form%202008.doc) that is posted to this Site, signing and returning it to the Webmaster by either (1) mail to 14841 Dallas Parkway, Dallas, Texas 75254 or (2) fax to 972-338-7689. When We ask for parental permission, We will tell the parents what We will do with the information his/her child provides Us, and We will tell parents how they can review their child's information and ask Us to delete the information. We do not keep parents' (or children's) e-mail address unless parents grant Us permission to do so. 

Company might retain and use an email address and any information contained in an email from a child under 13 without the parent's consent, but only in the following special case: If we discover that a child under 13 has sent an email request to Us or has otherwise communicated with us through electronic means (such as through the “Contact Us” portion of the Site), We will keep their e-mail address and the message for long enough to respond to them. In such event, Company may retain the email address and message (both the original message and the response) in its data archives in accordance with Company's data retention policies, but Company will not include the child's information in a marketing database or otherwise use that information for marketing or any purposes in violation of COPPA. 

Occasionally, Company has special site activities or promotions like sweepstakes or contests which are open to children even if they are under 13. In these activities, Company is not allowed to ask for more information from a child other than what is necessary for a child to participate in the activity. For instance, Company might ask for a parent's email address so Company can request information on how to send the child any prizes won or to tell a parent when his/her child has won a prize. 

Company also might collect contact information where it is necessary to protect a child's safety. 

A parent can always ask to review the information his/her child has submitted by sending an email to [webmaster@pizzahut.com](mailto:webmaster@pizzahut.com) or a written request addressed to Company, 14841 Dallas Parkway, Dallas, Texas 75254, Attention: Webmaster, Children's Online Privacy Act - Information Request, or by calling the webmaster at 972-338-7700. Requests must include the screen name of the child and any other information which will allow Company to verify that the requester is the parent of the child whose information is requested. A parent can ask to delete a child's information at any time and a parent can ask that Company not collect any more personal information from his/her child, by sending an email at [webmaster@pizzahut.com](mailto:webmaster@pizzahut.com) or a written request addressed to Company 14841 Dallas Parkway, Dallas, Texas 75254, Attn: Webmaster, Children's Online Privacy Act - Delete Request or by calling the Webmaster at 972-338-7700.
