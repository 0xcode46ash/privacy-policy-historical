# Privacy Policy - Pizza Hut Australia

**PIZZA HUT AUSTRALIA**  
A division of Yum! Restaurants Australia Pty Limited A.B.N. 16 000 674 993

PIZZA HUT is committed to the protection of your personal information. PIZZA HUT has developed its own privacy policy, which is based on the National Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act 1988. 

This Policy covers all personal information that we hold and includes information we have collected through our outlets, over the phone through our customer service centres and over the internet through our web sites. This Policy also covers personal information that we have sourced from third parties.

 **Collection**

PIZZA HUT will only collect personal information that is necessary for one or more of its functions or activities.

PIZZA HUT will only collect personal information by lawful and fair means and will let you know where and how to contact us.

If it is reasonable and practicable to do so, PIZZA HUT will collect personal information only from you. Where PIZZA HUT collects personal information about you from someone else, PIZZA HUT will take reasonable steps to advise you as soon as practicable.

PIZZA HUT will not collect sensitive information about you unless you have consented to such collection or the collection is required by law. 

Where you choose not to provide requested information, PIZZA HUT will advise you of what impact such non-disclosure may have.

 **Collection using this web site**

When you use this web site PIZZA HUT collects personal information, which you provide, to us and information about how you use our web site, for example by registering, making a purchase or posting original content to our site. This information includes your name, home or work address, phone number, e-mail contact and information about the products and services, which interest you. If you contact us, we may also keep a record of that contact. 

**Use**

PIZZA HUT may use your personal information to:

(a) process your orders for our products or services that you place with our Call Centres, web sites, directly with one of our outlets or any other representative of PIZZA HUT;

(c) administer and deal with any issues you raise with us regarding any of our products or services;

(d) analyse products and customer services and develop new products; and

(e) facilitate PIZZA HUT’s internal business operations, including fulfilment of any legal requirements.

We also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you. 

**Disclosure**

PIZZA HUT may disclose your personal information:

(a) to our agents, contractors or third party service providers that supply products or services to PIZZA HUT for the purpose of PIZZA HUT’s business. For example, your name, address and telephone number may be disclosed to a third party supplier of products or services that relate directly to a complaint that you have made about any of our products or services;

(b) to our franchisees, where the information relates to the PIZZA HUT franchise operated by the franchisee;

(c) where the law requires PIZZA HUT to do so; or

(d) if you consent.

Personal Information may be disclosed under other circumstances where permitted by the Privacy Act.

In the course of our business activities, PIZZA HUT may need to disclose some of your personal information to relevant business partners.

 **Opt-in**

We provide you with choice as to whether we send you information about special products and services in the future, and whether information is sent by our franchisees, agents or third party service providers. You may also change this choice in the future by contacting us with this request, although it may also be necessary to contact any other organisations which have obtained your information to indicate your choice at this stage.
