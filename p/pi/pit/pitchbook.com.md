Effective Date: December 1, 2009 

**OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY**  
PitchBook Data, Inc. (" **We** ", " **Us** ", " **Our** ") provides online research and data services offering premium data, news and analysis on the private equity and venture capital industries.  This privacy policy (" **Policy** ") generally describes our use of personal information that is collected at our Web site at www.pitchbook.com (" **Site** ").  Your privacy is very important to us and we are committed to protecting the privacy of personal information that you provide to us when using our Site. 

**YOUR USE OF OUR SITE OR YOUR PROVISION TO US OF ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION CONSTITUTES YOUR AGREEMENT TO THIS POLICY, SO PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITE OR PROVIDE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IF YOU DO NOT AGREE.**

**LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEB SITES**  
Our Site contains links to other Web sites operated by third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of such third party web sites and this Policy does not apply to those Web sites.  We recommend that you review the privacy policy at each Web site to determine how that site protects your privacy.

**THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT**   
We may collect information about your visit and use of the Site, including the pages you view, the links you click, the files you download, the search criteria used and other actions taken in connection with the Site.

Additionally, we may collect certain information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, operating system, geographic location, browser type and language, access times and referring Web site addresses.

When you receive newsletters or promotional e-mail from PitchBook, we may use customized links or similar technologies to determine whether the e-mail has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you with e-mail communications or other information that are more targeted to your needs.

Our Site contains cookies and other tracking mechanisms to store your preferences and other information on your computer.  Our use of cookies saves you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information and displaying your personalized content and appropriate advertising on your later visits to the Site. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of our Site that depend on cookies.

In order to verify whether you are entitled to access and use certain materials, content and services available from our Site, or to enable us to enhance your Site visit, or to assist you with customer service or technical support issues, we may ask you to provide certain personal information.

For example, we request information from you when you:

In each of the instances above, we typically ask for your name, e-mail address, phone number, mailing address, user name and password, as well as other similar personal information that is needed to register or subscribe you to our services. 

**HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION**  
We collect and use your personal information to analyze trends, track visitor traffic and interest, operate and improve the Site and deliver services or carry out the transactions you have requested. These uses may include providing you with more effective customer service; making the Site or services easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; performing research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies; and displaying content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences.

We may, from time to time, include advertisements on our Site and we may use certain information about you that we collect at our Site to determine which advertisements to display.  To the extent we work with third parties to provide such advertisements, we may provide them with certain information about you that we collect at our Site so they can select and display the advertisements for us. 

We also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues and security announcements. Certain PitchBook services may send periodic member letters that are considered part of the service. We may also occasionally send you product surveys or promotional mailings to inform you of other products or services available from PitchBook and its affiliates. We may also use your information to send you e-mail notifications, newsletters, news feeds, special offers or to otherwise contact you in connection with providing our services to you.  

Personal information collected on the Site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which PitchBook or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using the Site or a PitchBook service, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. 

We may also collect public and non-public information from you or third parties and combine it with information collected at the Site.  

**SHARING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
Except as described in this Policy, we will not disclose your personal information outside of PitchBook and its subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent. The Site may allow you to choose to share your personal information with select PitchBook partners so that they can contact you about their products, services or offers. Or, the Site may give you a choice as to whether you wish to receive communications from PitchBook on behalf of external business partners about a partner's particular offering (without transferring your personal information to the third party). 

If we offer co-branded services in conjunction with another company and you register for or use such services, both PitchBook and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services.

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.

We may also transfer your information in connection with a merger, acquisition, consolidation, change of control, corporate divestiture or dissolution where we sell all or a portion of our business or assets (including our associated customer lists containing your personal information). We may access and / or disclose your personal information if we believe such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on PitchBook; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of PitchBook (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or members of the public.

**HOW TO OPT-OUT OF RECEIVING PROMOTIONAL EMAILS**  
You can stop the delivery of future promotional e-mail from the Site by following the specific instructions in the e-mail you receive.

**OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY**  
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information we collect through the Site.  If we, an affiliate, or one of our service providers is required to disclose or provide notice to you of unauthorized access to or other invasions of certain security systems, you agree that we may provide you notice by either posting notice on our Site or sending notice to any e-mail address we have for you.     

**ACCESSING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
We may provide you the ability to view or edit your personal information online. In order to help prevent your personal information from being viewed by others, you will be required to sign in with your credentials (user name and password).

**CHANGES TO THIS POLICY**  
We will occasionally update this Policy to reflect changes in our services and customer feedback. When we post changes to this Policy, we will revise the "Effective Date" at the top of this Policy. If there are material changes to this Policy or in how we will use your personal information, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes prior to implementing the change or by directly sending you a notification.
