**[Home](https://web.archive.org/) > Privacy Policy**

**No Personal Data:**  
InterNich LLC (parent owner of PicResize.com) takes your privacy concerns extremely seriously. At PicResize.com we follow one simple rule: we do not ask for any personally identifiable information from you, unless you specifically use the _Save to Web_ feature which requires you to enter a valid e-mail address to prevent abuse of the system. Unlike other image-related websites, we will never ask for your e-mail address, name, mailing address, age, sex, race, or any other personal information. 

**Uploaded Images:**  
Because of the nature of our image-resizing service, you are required to transmit to us your image. We will always respect your confidentiality. No staff or affiliates of InterNich, LLC and PicResize.com will ever access your personal images on our servers. Furthermore, our system automatically, without intervention, deletes all your images (including original images and resized images) permanently from our servers exactly 20 minutes from time of resizing. 

**Technology:**  
PicResize.com does not make our users store cookies from our site on your computer, unless you specifically use the _Remember My Settings_ feature which will only store your customizations. However, because of limiting circumstances beyond our powers, advertising networks such as Google, Inc. (for Google Adsense) may store cookies on your computer to track technological information. This 3rd party cookie tracking does not contain personally identifiable data. Please see respective 3rd party website to view their bounded Privacy Policies. 

**No Transfers:**  
Since we collect no data about you, we will never sell, trade, barter, or transmit any of this non-existing data. Since we have a zero-tolerance spam policy and we do not have your e-mail address any way, we will never send you any unsolicited e-mail.
