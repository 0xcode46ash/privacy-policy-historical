**Site Guide**   
  
|  |  Pictage.com has created this privacy statement to give you information on how we gather information and to assure you of our commitment to your privacy.  **What personal information does Pictage.com collect and how do we use it?**   
The personal information we collect consists of data that you have given during the registration process. We require that all guests who would like to place an order provide us with their name, address, zip code, e-mail address and credit card information. 

We also keep track of your visits to the site and all purchases you make through us with this information. 

**Does Pictage.com disclose my personally identifiable information to others? If so, to whom?**   
Your contact and order information is passed onto the partner photographer or vendors who are responsible for fulfilling photo orders to your event. If you are an event holder, Pictage.com reserves the right to contact you about your account. 

In order to protect the privacy of our event holders, your e-mail address is made available to the registered owner of any event that you attempt to log in to while logged onto Pictage.com. 

You have two "Opt-In" choices. First, you may opt to receive valuable offers from Pictage.com. Second, you can opt to receive valuable offers from our partner photographers and other merchants. If you choose to "Opt Out"; you will not receive any e-mail discounts or other form of direct mail from our partners or us. 

Our site may contain links to other sites. If you jump to these other sites, Pictage.com will not forward any information it has received from you to the next site. However, Pictage.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other websites. 

**How does Pictage.com store my personal identifiable information?**   
Pictage.com also keeps your IP address confidential and uses it to help diagnose problems with our server, analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. 

Pictage.com uses a firewall and password protected accounts to prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control. All machines are in a secured environment. Any archived information is also kept in a secured location. 

**How is my credit card information protected?**   
Importantly, we do not store any credit card information at Pictage.com. We have partnered with CyberCash TM, for our e-commerce capabilities. 

CyberCash is the pioneer of major electronic commerce payment advances on the Internet. Dedicated to security and maintaining your trust, CyberCash is the only company with a worldwide export license for the 1024-bit RSA encryption algorithm, and also offers the first real-time, secure credit card authentication service over the Internet that is based on digital signatures. CyberCash is continuously working with all the major credit card companies to bring you the latest in secure encryption technologies. 

CyberCash has adopted the new SET protocol and is incorporating it into CyberCash's suite of Internet payment solutions. The transition to SET will provide secure, open standard-based solutions for the many merchants, banks, processors and consumers including those using CyberCash's existing services.

**What is a "cookie"? Does Pictage.com use them?**   
Yes, cookies are an integral part of efficiently and easily storing and retrieving information 

A cookie is information that Pictage.com puts on your hard disk so that it can remember something about you at a later time. Typically, a cookie records your preferences when using a particular site. Using the Web's Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), each request for a Web page is independent of all other requests. For this reason, the Web page server has no memory of what pages it has sent to a user previously or anything about your previous visits. A cookie is a mechanism that allows Pictage.com's server to store its own information about a user on the user's own computer. You can view the cookies that have been stored on your hard disk (although the content stored in each cookie may not make much sense to you). The location of the cookies depends on the browser. Internet Explorer stores each cookie as a separate file under a Windows subdirectory. Netscape stores all cookies in a single cookies.txt fle. Opera stores them in a single cookies.dat file. 

Cookies are commonly used to rotate the banner ads that a site sends so that it doesn't keep sending the same ad as it sends you a succession of requested pages. They can also be used to customize pages for you based on your browser type or other information you may have provided us. Web users must agree to let cookies be saved for them, but, in general, it helps Pictage.com to serve users better. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user may be limited in some areas of our site. For example, the user may not be able to participate in any of our Sweepstakes, Contests or monthly Drawings that take place. Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 

**Can I delete personally identifiable information on the site?**   
Yes you can. If you no longer want any information about you in our database, click on [remove@pictage.com](mailto:remove@pictage.com). As an alternative, when you are at the log in page, you can click on the "click here if this isn't you" button and that will erase any stored cookies.  **Are my pictures available for public viewing?**   
After you view the proofs your photographer has taken for you, you can edit these photos for viewing by your invited guests. Your site is password protected and only those people that you give the password to will have access to your event photos.  **What do you do with survey responses?**   
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). 

Your responses are completely confidential and are used to help us tailor our services to you. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. We appreciate your participation in the on-going development of our service. 

**Referral Promotional Programs**   
If a user elects to participate in any of our promotional referral programs for directing guests to our site, we will ask them for the friend's name and email address. Pictage.com will automatically send the friend an e-mail inviting them to visit the site. Pictage.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this e-mail. The guest may contact Pictage.com at [remove@Pictage.com](mailto:remove@pictage.com) to request the removal of this information from their database.  **Changes to privacy policy**   
Pictage.com reserves the right from time to time to make changes to its Privacy Policy. 

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email if you have "opted-in" to receive e-mail notifications. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, please contact [support@pictage.com](mailto:support@pictage.com).
