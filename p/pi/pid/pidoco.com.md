In case of doubt, the German version of this privacy and data protection policy shall prevail.

Pidoco GmbH’s Privacy Policy

We run a technical system on or through our website, which enables you to create interactive software prototypes – including visualisations of user interfaces and navigation processes – and then give other users an opportunity to edit and use them as well as comment on them. As a registered user, you can also at the same time contact other users and interact with them for the purpose of designing and testing the prototype. Basically, this involves exchanging all manner of information; in connection with creating user interfaces and prototypes, this will include data that you as a user have posted on the platform yourself and made visible for fellow users. Some of this information will be personal data. We always fully comply with the regulations laid down in the Federal Data Protection Act [Bundesdatenschutzgesetz] and the Telemedia Act [Telemediengesetz], and we only collect and process your personal data to the extent specified in our Privacy Policy given under.

This having been said, a detailed explanation is given below of the extent to which we collect, process and use personal data, and for what purpose. You may naturally withdraw your consent at any time. Written notice that you are withdrawing consent can be sent by post to Pidoco GmbH, Warschauer Str. 58a, 10243 Berlin, or by email to service@pidoco.com. Please note though that after you have given notice, you will no longer be able to access some of the services and functions.

1\. Type and scope of personal data collected and processed

  
We collect and process personal data when you register for the services on our website and when you send messages to other users. To a certain extent, we also store data that accumulates during use of our website, but only in anonymous form or under a pseudonym. Moreover, when you design prototypes after registering, the content you create is stored electronically on the servers of our provider of web-hosting services (Hetzner Online AG), so that the data can be retrieved by third parties as you have intended and to the extent that is required for our service in the first place.

a) Master data

  
If you want to use our services you have to register, whereupon you will be sent the access data for your account. During registration we always ask for and store the following master data:

  * your first name and surname,
  * your user name, if you select one for your own profile later,
  * your password for accessing Pidoco’s service, and
  * an email address where we can contact you for providing our services.



As soon as you make use of Pidoco’s fee-paying services, we also collect the following master data:

  * your address (street and number, postcode and location), and
  * your payment data, such as bank account details, credit card number, etc.



Once you become a user, we need your master data in order to be able to identify you as our contractual partner, open and run your user account, actually provide our services, and contact you if necessary. For instance, we use your email address to inform you about using our services, to give you advance notice of downtimes for system maintenance, and to send you information relevant to your contract, such as confirmation of contract closure or notification about the expiry of a trial period. Your customer status, as embodied in your master data, also enables you to access your user account: you can log in to your user account with your user name.

The name of your company and your VAT number are added to the master data listed above, if you provide that information voluntarily. For handling payments for our services, we pass on the applicable information about your credit card, bank account, etc. to the payment service provider you have indicated, such as PayPal, Wirecard AG, etc., depending on the mode of payment you have chosen. The data protection provisions of the respective payment service provider you have selected then also apply in addition.

b) Email newsletter

  
We also use your email address to send you a newsletter by email at reasonable intervals, provided you have expressly consented to this by clicking on the relevant checkbox. Apart from edited articles and information, the newsletter may also contain advertisements for our products or new services. However, you can cancel the newsletter at any time by sending an email to [service@pidoco.com](mailto:service@pidoco.com) or simply by clicking on the link provided in each newsletter.

c) Usage data, usage profile, cookies

  
On principle, you can also view our website without specifically providing any personal data. Nonetheless, some data still accumulates during usage. The following applies to this so-called usage data:

aa) When our website is visited by registered users or by ordinary Internet users, we store certain data that is collected in so-called logfiles. A logfile consists of the IP address, the time when the visit to our website started and ended, the quantity of data transmitted, and the sub-pages called up on our website. We collect and store these logfiles, for one thing for security reasons, in order to be able to trace any instances of misuse of our services. From this data, we can analyse how our services are used – we can find out which pages are particularly popular, for instance, the times when our services are put to most intensive use, whether there is smooth navigation amongst the services, etc. This analysis produces results in statistical form that are anonymous. We use these results for improving our services both technically and editorially. So in fact, we do not know what your preferred use pattern is; we only know that a user with that use pattern exists. We have no interest whatsoever in using an IP address in order to identify you as an individual.

bb) Our website uses the “eTracker” tool (etracker GmbH, Erste Brunnenstrasse 1, 20459 Hamburg, Germany) for doing Web analysis. eTracker uses cookies, which are text files that are stored on your computer and allow your usage of the website to be analysed (for more on cookies, see Item cc) below). The information about your usage of the website that is generated by the cookie is transmitted to a server run by etracker GmbH, where it is stored. Web analytics on our Internet platform are done with eTracker set to the data protection option “Extended data privacy compliance” [Erweiterte Datenschutzkonformität]; this means that complete IP addresses are not processed and that only an abbreviated version is stored. IP addresses are shortened by the last 8 Bit, which renders them anonymous. etracker GmbH uses this information to analyse your usage of our website, to compile reports for us about activities on our website, and to provide additional services connected with use of our website and of the Internet. etracker GmbH on no account links your IP address with any other data or passes the data on to third parties. Details on how etracker GmbH handles the data can be obtained from its privacy policy at: [http://www.etracker.com/de/datenschutz.html](http://www.etracker.com/de/datenschutz.html). [Exclude from data storage](https://www.etracker.de/privacy?et=SLsx23).

You can at any time object to your data being collected, stored and used as specified in Item 1. c) above.

cc) We also use cookies on our website. Our cookies send us the log-in data, provide us with information about which browser you use and the browser version, and tell us the time and date of your visit to our website as well as the cookie number. Using cookies during registration (to the extent required – see above) and use of our services enables us to recognise you if you re-visit our website after the end of a session. Using these cookies also means that you do not have to log-in again next time you visit our service.

In the event that you want to prevent cookies (including those specified in bb) above) being used, your browser can be set such that it prevents new cookies being accepted and stored. In order to find out how this works in the particular browser you use, you can refer to its “help” function or ask the manufacturer. However, it is only by using cookies that we can achieve the all-round safety and convenience of the application which we constantly endeavour to provide.

d) Content data

  
When you design prototypes and use the message function to contact other users, you are given a possibility of posting texts, images, videos, websites and other content on our servers, and of altering your content as well. You can invite other users to adapt or view your prototype and also communicate with them, and for this purpose you make your email address, user name and where applicable your avatar visible to them. You also make this information visible when as a user you accept an invitation from a fellow user to adapt or view his or her prototype. We store this content in order to provide it for retrieval in the Internet and enable our service in the first place – and if you provide personal data in connection with your prototype, this obviously includes that data as well. At the same time though, you decide entirely independently which information you want to disclose about yourself, and by deciding whom to invite you decide which users you disclose it to. In technical terms, we ensure that the data you have provided and released is posted in the relevant places on our website. On no account is your password or any data other than that specified above visible for the Internet public or even for other registered users.

After terminating the contract on use, your user account and your personal data are erased irrevocably if you so request. The other content you have posted can still be retrieved on principle though – this applies in particular to messages and interactions with other users. However, you can contact us by email and request that certain content be deleted. 

2\. Disclosure of data to third parties, publication of content data

a) Disclosure

  
We only pass your data on to third parties

  * if and insofar as this is necessary in order to implement the contract we have with you, or to assert any rights and claims on our own part;
  * where official enquiries are involved, in particular if requested by judicial or supervisory authorities, and if disclosure is required in order to avert a threat to public safety or law and order, and for prosecuting criminal offences; and/or
  * if we are otherwise under obligation to do so by law.



b) Publication

The content data that you have transmitted to our servers so that it can be uploaded is “published” so-to-speak when we make it available technically on the designated page on the Internet, such that other users can retrieve it as described above.

3\. Links to other websites

  
Our website contains links to the websites of other providers with whom we are in no way associated. After you have clicked on one of these links, we have no further influence on how any personal data is processed that is automatically transmitted to the other provider by the hyperlink (such as your IP address, or the URL where the link is installed), because evidently third-party conduct is entirely beyond our control. We can therefore accept no responsibility whatsoever for the processing of your personal data by third parties.

4\. Information, correction, erasure, blocking

We will inform you at any time which of your personal data we have stored if you so request in writing or in text form. You can also request us at any time to block or erase your data. Only that data is excluded from erasure which we need for completing any unfinished tasks or for asserting our rights and claims, or which we are obliged to retain by law.

5\. Safety

  
We take technical and organisational steps to ensure that our users’ personal data is protected against loss, manipulation or unauthorised third-party access. Moreover, we only ever allow entitled persons to access your personal data, and even then only to the extent required for the above purposes.
