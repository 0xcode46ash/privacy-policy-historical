#### **Information Collected Automatically**

When you use the Service, we use persistent and session cookies (for information on cookies, please see below) and other tracking technologies to: (a) store your username and password; (b) analyze the usage of the Service; (c) customize the Service to your preferences; and (d) enhance your navigation through the site. A persistent cookie remains on your computer after you close your browser so that it can be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.

We may also use other Internet technologies, log files, clear GIFs and other similar technologies, to deliver or communicate with cookies and track your use of the Service. We also may include clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to determine whether the message has been opened. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather additional information through other methods.

We use these automated technologies to collect and analyze certain types of information we consider to be non-personal information, including: (a) information related to the devices you use to access or interact with the Service, such as: IP addresses, , unique device identifiers and other information about your mobile phone or other mobile device(s), browser types, browser language; and (b) information related to the ways in which you interact with the Service, such as: referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time you used the Service, and other similar information. We may also capture other data, such as search criteria and results.

Piazza discloses a subset of this automatically collected information. Specifically, you consent to Piazza's disclosure of information related to the ways in which you interact with the Service, such as: landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages (including questions and answers viewed), the date and time you used the Service, and other similar information on the Service to other users, along with your name and profile.

Piazza uses some of this information to help instructors manage their classes and improve learning outcomes. For example, which questions and answers you view may help your instructors understand where the class is struggling to understand a concept. Similarly, knowing what times your classmates are using Piazza helps a professor measure engagement before a midterm. You consent to Piazza's disclosure of information related to the ways in which you interact with the Service.

### Cookies

A cookie is a small text file stored by a website in a user’s web browser that helps us in many ways to make your use of the Service more efficient and meaningful to you. Among other things, cookies avoid you having to log in every time you come back to our website. They also allow us to tailor the Service to better match your needs.

A persistent cookie remains on your computer after you close your browser so that it can be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Persistent cookies stay on your computer until either they expire or are overwritten with newer cookies, or you manually remove them. Most browsers can be configured not to accept cookies, however, this may prevent you from having access to some site functions or features.

While specific names of the cookies and similar technologies that we use may change from time to time as we improve and update our services, they generally fall into the below categories of use:

Authentication and security cookies. We use these cookies to enable you to remain logged into Piazza, and verify that it is you as you use Piazza. This helps keep your account safe and secure from unauthorized use, and helps combat spam and other abuse which violates our policies.

### How We Share Your Information

#### **Personally Identifiable Information**

We use the personal information you submit to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service. Piazza may share your personally identifiable information with third parties for the purpose of providing the Service to you. If we do this, such third parties' use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of Piazza (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).

As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.

Piazza may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Piazza's rights or property.

By using the Service you consent to the transfer of your information to the United States and/or to other countries for storage, processing and use by Piazza in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

From time to time, we may run contests, advertisements, or other events or activities ("Events") on the Service together with a third party partner. If you provide information to such third parties, you give them permission to use it for the purpose of that Event and any other use that you approve. We cannot control third parties' use of your information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these Events.

### Non-Personally Identifiable Information:

We may aggregate and/or anonymize information collected through the Service so that the information does not identify you. We may use aggregated, anonymized, and other non-personally identifiable information for any purpose, including for research and marketing purposes, and our use and disclosure of such information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy.

### How We Protect Your Information

Piazza uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Piazza or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Piazza will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with applicable law.

### Your Choices About Your Information

You may decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Service, in which case Piazza may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your account information and email preferences at any time by logging in to your account and going to your "Account/Email Settings" page. You can review and correct the information about you that Piazza keeps on file by contacting us directly at [team@piazza.com](mailto:team@piazza.com).

### Children's Privacy

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. Piazza does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 (or under the age of 14 for anyone living in Spain or South Korea) or knowingly allow such persons to register with the Service. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without parental consent, we will remove that information.

### Links to Other Web Sites

We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the Service, nor the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our website, is subject to that website's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.

### Your California Privacy Rights

California law permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed their personally identifiable information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the types of personally identifiable information disclosed to those parties. If you are a California resident and would like to request this information, please submit your request in an email to [team@piazza.com](mailto:team@piazza.com).

### Changes to Our Privacy Policy

If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on this page to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
