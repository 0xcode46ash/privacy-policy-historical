# Pioneer Europe Privacy Policy

  
The following statement outlines our policy regarding the privacy of the personally identifiable information our customers choose to share with us. We recognize that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a responsible manner.

 **Personal information entered in forms**

Pioneer-eur.com may use forms to allow customers to request information or give feedback about our products and services. This information will only be used for Pioneer internal purposes and shall not be disclosed to third parties.

Pioneer Europe NV is committed to taking reasonable steps to protect the individual identifying information that you provide to us. We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible within Pioneer on an "as needed" basis by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to such systems. When you enter personal information, we offer the use of a secure server. All personal information supplied by you is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into Pioneer Europe's databases to be only accessed as stated above. This database resides on a different machine from the web server.

 **Web site access logging.**

Pioneer-eur may log IP addresses for systems administration purposes. IP addresses are logged to track your session. This gives Pioneer an idea of which parts of our site you are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that your session will be tracked, but you will remain anonymous. We may also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to help administer our website. In addition to your IP number, we may collect referer information which tells us what page sent you to a particular page on the Pioneer-eur.com web site.

 **Links to other web sites**
