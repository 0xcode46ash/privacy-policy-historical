##  Automatically Collected Information

As is true of most web sites, when you access and use the Web Site, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Web Site, to track users' movements around the Web Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to segregate customer types for analytical purposes.

##  Use of Service Providers

We occasionally hire or partner with other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as managing and handling the processing and delivery of mailings (both email and postal mail), providing customer support, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.  
On some of our credit processing service provider’s pages, it may look as though you are still on Pixmac.com, the information collected on these pages is collected directly from our third party service providers in order to process your payment information.  These service providers then share the information back with Pixmac in order for us to complete the order and ship it out.  Our privacy policy does not govern the collection and use of this information.  
We use Skype and ICQ to allow you to chat with one of our representatives.  Please note that any information you provide during these chat sessions will be logged and may be used to contact you in regards to your inquiry.  The only person who has access to your information is the representative to whom you are speaking with.
