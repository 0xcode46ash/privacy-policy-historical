### Use of Cookies

When you visit the Web Site, we place a "cookie" on the hard drive of your computer to track your visit. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your hard drive through your web browser that can only be read by the web site that placed the cookie on your hard drive. The cookie functions similarly to an identification card and allows the Web Site to identify you and to record your passwords and preferences. The cookie allows Pixellogo to track your visit to the Web Site so that Pixellogo can better understand your use of the Web Site and your interest in the goods and services provided therein so that Pixellogo can customize and tailor the Web Site to better meet your needs. For a detailed description of what a "cookie" is, refer to [this definition](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid14_gci211838,00.html) on the TechTarget web site.

Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. However, on most web browsers you may change this setting to have your web browser either: (1) notify you prior to a web site placing a cookie on your hard drive so that you can decide whether or not to accept the cookie; or (2) automatically prevent the placing of a cookie on your hard drive. It should be noted that if cookies are not accepted, you will not be able to access a number of web pages. If you choose not to accept the cookies placed on your hard drive by Pixellogo, you will not be able to access a number of web pages found on the Web Site.

### Security

Pixellogo endeavors to provide a secure environment in which you can provide and obtain access to information about you. Pixellogo has security measures in place to prevent the modification, misuse, loss or misappropriation of information about you, including the provision of a secure environment in which the information is stored and controlling access to such information by parties external to Pixellogo.

One such security measure used by Pixellogo is assigning you a user identification and password upon setting up an Account with Pixellogo. You acknowledge and agree that the user identification provided by Pixellogo to you so that you may access, utilize or otherwise enjoy the Web Site and the password selected by and used by you in conjunction with the user identification to access, utilize or otherwise enjoy the Web Site are to be kept secret and confidential. You shall not disclose the user identification or password to any other party without the express written permission of Pixellogo. You further acknowledge and agree that you will be responsible for each and every access, use or enjoyment of the products or services and of the content that occurs in conjunction with the password and user identification given to you by Pixellogo, and that Pixellogo is authorized to accept the user identification and password as conclusive evidence that you have accessed, utilized, or otherwise enjoyed the products or services or the content.

### Changing or Updating Your Information or Your Privacy Preferences

You may, at any time, view or update all of your information stored in your Account, including your privacy preferences, by either logging into your Account on the Web Site and following the appropriate links or by contacting Pixellogo directly as set out in the Contact Us section below. We ask that you review your Account information regularly to assist Pixellogo in ensuring that your information remains accurate and up-to-date.

In some cases, Pixellogo may not be able to provide you with all the information that it has collected about you. This would occur if provision of the information could lead to disclosure of another individual's personal information, where laws or regulations prevent disclosure, or where it would simply be too costly to provide the information such as a request to provide you with a detailed history of every web page on the Web Site visited by you. If Pixellogo decides not to disclose some or all of the information collected about you, Pixellogo will advise you of the reason.

You may also withdraw your consent to the terms and conditions contained in this privacy policy by providing notice in writing to that effect delivered to the address as specified in the Contact Us section below. However, please note that if you do withdraw your consent to the provisions of this Privacy Policy, Pixellogo will cancel your Account. You further acknowledge and agree that you will not, after withdrawing your consent to the provisions of this Privacy Policy, acquire or license a product or service offered by Pixellogo (including products or services of third parties) or use or access the Web Site or information, material, products or services provided therein. You may however continue to use products acquired or licensed prior to the cancellation of your Account. If you acquire or license any product or service offered by Pixellogo (including products or services of third parties) or use the Web Site after withdrawing your consent, such action signifies your consent and agreement to the terms and conditions contained in this Privacy Policy, and to the collection, use and disclosure described herein of your personal information by Pixellogo.
