**In order to use this website to the full potential, we highly recommend you to first complete the registration form (Required for Forums). During registration a user is required to give their e-mail address, nickname, and other optional identifiers. This information is to identify the user, and for other users to interact with the user. None of this information will be sold, transmitted, or in any other way sent to any third parties. You also may be asked for your location, instant messenger names, etc but these are only optional and you may leave them empty.**  
   
**Cookies**  
**Cookies are used to identify the user when he/she logs in, and for tracking purposes. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. More specifically, we use this on pixel2life.com in that the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. It is still possible to use pixel2life without cookies.**

**Pixel2life staff will NEVER ask for your password. If someone does ask for your password or other info, please immediately notify us.**

**From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.**

**Hi Gang! Here are some of the latest goodies sent to me via the contact form for CBuzz pluggage:

[Pixel-Pulse.com](http://www.pixel-pulse.com/) is back online with a new site and a new server on the other side of the Atlantic, and they are celebrating the rebirth with a 1 Year Hosting giveaway contest that you can check out [HERE](http://www.pixel-pulse.com//content/view/26/2/)!

The serious stuff ends here.

Now for the insane stuff I tend to bring to the table for your viewing pleasure! Got Jesus? Get your Christian Jerseys (No, I'm not joking) at [christianthrowbackjersey.com](http://www.christianthrowbackjersey.com/) and show your colors! Perhaps the harsh realities of world news are getting you down? It's time to stop surfing CNN.com and start using [happynews.com](http://www.happynews.com/)! For you American folks looking to find out if you're a yankee or a southern rebel, [alphadictionary.com](http://www.alphadictionary.com/articles/yankeetest.html) has got the perfect test for you, and for the chess nerds, not even your sport is safe from the "sex sells" [revolution](http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=1826)!

And finally... new heights in idiocy have been achieved over at [smashmyxbox.com](http://www.smashmyxbox.com/). The name says it all.. send him money, he'll buy an xBox, then smash it up. Folks, if you send these guys so much as a DIME, you are going straight to hell in a handbasket.
