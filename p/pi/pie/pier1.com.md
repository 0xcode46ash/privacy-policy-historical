# Pier 1 Imports - Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:  October 1, 2007**

Pier 1 Imports has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to our visitors' and customers' privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices that apply to information collected on this website at www.pier1.com, from catalog requests and in our stores.

#### Information Collection and Use

When you visit our Site or one of our stores, or request to be placed on our mailing list; whether online, by phone; or in person, or if you participate in a contest, promotion or survey, we may collect information from you, such as your name, email and postal addresses, and phone and credit card numbers.

We use personal information, such as a purchaser's name, email address, postal address, telephone number and credit card information, to complete merchandise purchases and returns. We may also use personal information to contact a purchaser when necessary, such as when a delivery may be delayed or when a product is out of stock. Sensitive information such as credit card numbers are encrypted and protected as described in the "Security" section below. In some instances, we may engage the services of service providers to assist us with completing merchandise purchases. These third parties may have access to our users' personally identifiable information to provide these services to us or on our behalf, but they are not permitted to use it for other purposes.

In addition, Pier 1 Imports uses personally identifiable information to notify consumers about products or services in which we believe they may be interested. We describe, in the choices section below, how you can request that we no longer send you such marketing communications.

We may also request additional information, such as annual income, buying preferences, or age, also known as demographic and profile data, though this information is optional and never required for you to place an order or make a purchase. If you provide the additional information, we may use this data to improve our Site and enhance your shopping experience. For example, we may use this data to tailor your experience at our Site, showing you content that we think you might be interested in, and displaying content according to your preferences.

Pier 1 Imports may combine the information that you give us and information about your purchase (other than sensitive credit card information) with other personally identifiable information available from our records and other sources (such as demographic information and past purchase history), and use it to make our future marketing efforts more efficient. This information may also be shared with other companies to bring you offers of interest. If you prefer that we do not share your information in this way, please follow the instructions in the choice section below.

However, even if you request that we not share your information, Pier 1 Imports reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Web site and applicable laws, or to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Web site. We also may disclose user information whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to limit our legal liability; to protect or defend our rights or property; or protect the safety, rights, or property of our users. In addition, may sell, transfer, or otherwise disclose user information, including personally identifiable information, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, or other fundamental corporate change.

#### Cookies and Web Beacons

"Cookies" are pieces of information that are placed on an individual's computer hard drive to enable the individual to more easily communicate and interact with the Pier 1 Imports Site. Pier 1 Imports may use cookies to customize your shopping experience and to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. However, you may disallow cookies through your web browser and still browse and shop on our Site. Pier 1 Imports will never use cookies to retrieve information from a computer that is unrelated to the Pier 1 Site or your interaction with the Pier 1 Site.

Web beacons, also sometimes called "pixel tags," are small strings of code placed on a Web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data.

We and the online marketing company that we use to help manage our Internet business and communications employ cookies and Web beacons placed on our Site's pages to deliver our ads, to measure the effectiveness of our advertising, including our email promotions, and to learn how visitors use our Site.

The ad-serving technology uses non-personal information about your visits to our Site and the sites upon which we advertise to serve our ads to you. In the course of delivering our advertisements, a unique third-party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser. The Web beacons used in conjunction with this third-party ad cookie enable our ad server to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits this Site and to learn which banner ads bring visitors to this Site. If you do not want your non-personal information to be used to serve ads to you, please [click here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy).

The technology that we use to send our emails also utilizes Web beacons and cookies -- both in the messages and at our Site -- to help us measure the effectiveness of our campaigns. For more information about the technology used to deliver our emails, or how to set your browser to reject cookies, please [click here](http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/email/).

#### Internet Protocol (IP) Address

We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart for the duration of a session and to gather broad demographic information.

#### Other Sites

Our Site may contain links to other sites. Other sites may also reference or link to our Site. Pier 1 Imports is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other sites or how information you provide to those sites is handled. You should consult the individual privacy policies of those sites to determine their privacy practices.

#### Supplemental Information

We may supplement the information that you provide to us with information that is received from third parties.

#### Security

We take seriously the security of sensitive personally identifiable information we collect online from our customers. In addition, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.

#### Choice/Opt-Out

As discussed above, we may from time to time use personally identifiable information to provide users with opportunities to learn about products or services in which we believe they may be interested. Users can opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us at any time by following the instructions contained at the end of our communications or by sending an e-mail to [Customer_Service@pier1.com](mailto:Customer_Service@pier1.com).

As we also set out above, we may, from time to time, share personally identifiable information with unrelated third parties to enable them to provide you with additional product or service opportunities. If you prefer that we do not share your information with such third parties for their own marketing purposes, please e-mail us at [Customer_Service@pier1.com](mailto:Customer_Service@pier1.com).
