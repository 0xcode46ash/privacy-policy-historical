#### Definitions

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small text file that is sent to your browser from a Web site and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies cannot read data from your hard disk or read cookie files that were created by other sites. Only the originating Web site cookie can be read by the browser.

#### Policy

**Type of Information Collected**

The Library does not collect any personally identifiable information about individuals, such as names and postal or e-mail addresses except when such information is voluntarily submitted by the user. Personally identifiable information might be obtained from online transactions such as submissions, registrations, or donor pledges. Additionally, personally identifiable information may be transmitted in connection with other activities, services, or resources made available on the Library’s Web site. 

In common with many Web sites, the Library's Web site automatically logs certain non-personally identifiable information about visits to its Web site. This information is used for system administration and for producing usage statistics.

 **How the Information Is Used**

Any personally identifiable information provided to the Library is maintained by and accessible only to the Library unless the Library explicitly states otherwise. The Library will not release information on the use of specific Internet or Web site resources by members of the public except as required by law or necessary for the proper operation of the Library.

 **Third-Party Partners**

The Library has teamed up with reputable third-party vendors in order to provide certain services to its online users. In cases when users leave the Library's site to visit one of its partners' sites, users are encouraged to become familiar with the privacy statements of each site they visit.

 **Security**

The Library has all reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial measures in place to prevent unauthorized access to the information it collects online. The Library does not, however, claim any responsibility for information collected by or from Web sites linking to or from the Library's Web site.

 **Cookies**

Examples of ways in which the Library might use cookies would be to customize content areas or to analyze site activity, user behavior, and/or to maintain the state of authentication for member privileged pages during a given session.

If you are concerned about the use of cookies, the Library suggests that you explore your browser's options to notify you whenever a cookie is set or to disallow cookies altogether. Users should be aware, however, that prohibiting the use of cookies may restrict the user's access to certain types of Web content or features.

 **Children**

The Library urges all parents to participate in their children's exploration of the Internet and to teach them about protecting their personal information while online. Parents should remind their children to ask their permission before providing personal information to any Web site or purchasing any products or services online. 

**Promotional E-mail, Newsletter, and E-News Policy and Opt-In/Opt-Out Elections**

If you give permission, the Library may use personally identifiable information you submit to contact you for promotional purposes. For example, on occasion the Library may wish to send e-mails to inform users of new exhibitions or other events the Library deems may be of interest to them. You will not receive such communications unless you have willingly provided the personal information required. In some cases, you will be required to "opt-in" by joining a newsgroup or mailing list. If you do opt-in, you will always have the option to opt-out at any time by unsubscribing from that particular list.

 **Policy Changes**

The Library may occasionally change this Web site Privacy Policy as new services and content are added to the site or to reflect changes in the Library's policies. Visitors to the Library's Web site are encouraged to check this document periodically to stay informed of current Library privacy guidelines.

 **Acceptance of Terms**

By using the Library's Web site, you signify your acceptance of this Web site Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use the Library’s Web site.
