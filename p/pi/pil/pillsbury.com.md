### The Pillsbury Company Online Privacy Policy

The Pillsbury Company is very sensitive to the privacy concerns of the visitors to its site on the Internet. As a general policy, no personal information is automatically collected from visitors to the site. However, certain non-personal information of visitors is recorded by the standard operation of The Pillsbury Company's Internet servers. This information is primarily used to provide an enhanced online experience for the visitor. Information tracked includes the type of operating system in use (e.g., Macintosh, Windows) and the type of browser being used by the visitor (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer). 

Other uses of this information include internal review of the number of visitors to the site, but only in an aggregate and non-personally-identifiable form. E-mail addresses and other personally identifiable data about visitors to this site are known only when voluntarily submitted. 

Personally identifiable information that may be collected in connection with visitors is retained by The Pillsbury Company and is not sold or otherwise transferred outside the company. This information is collected to help us better understand visitors' use of our site. 

**A SPECIAL NOTE TO PARENTS:** To protect the interests of children, it is the policy of The Pillsbury Company that no information should be submitted to or posted at Pillsbury Web Sites by children 16 years of age or under, without the consent of a parent or guardian. Pillsbury does not actively seek any demographic or preference information from children, nor will it ever disclose any personally identifying information regarding children to third parties. 

Users of Pillsbury Web Sites should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, e-mail address, etc.) on a "bulletin board" or in a chat area, the information can be collected and used by other Web surfers. This may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties. In addition, Pillsbury Web Sites may contain links to other sites. We make every effort to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy. However, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices of other sites. 

The Pillsbury Company reserves the right to change this privacy policy at any time, and will immediately post the updated policy on its site.
