# Pip$Fund.com: The investment fund from veterans of online trading!

Privacy policy 

We respect the sovereignty of the individual and the individual right to privacy. Other than the basic information of name, username and contact email address, PipsFund.com does not collect personal or business information from our clients under any circumstances. As a business based in an offshore financial centre, we enjoy the strict privacy laws of our jurisdiction and are therefore self mandated to protect the integrity of our client’s privacy.

If at any time you think you have been solicited by or have received an email from us, which requests your personal or business information, we can assure you it will not have come from us. In such instance it would most assuredly be an individual attempting to spy on your personal affairs and they will be misrepresenting themselves. We would suggest in such instances that you do not provide your personal information to them under any circumstances.

This means names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, credit card information, national identity numbers, passport numbers, and similar information (except of course for the initial email address we request from you when you register an account with us.) That email address is the only private piece of information we shall ever request from you as you can use any ‘name’ you wish to register your account. It is entirely up to you what email address you provide at the time of your account registration. It may be an anonymous email or a web based email. The email you choose for your account registration is your business. We recommend you use an anonymouse email service or a web based email service to enhance your online privacy and security.

Any information disclosed by you for any reason is information you volunteer and you should assume that volunteered information can be stolen off the web and/or used and abused by people who may wish to obtain your information. If you decide to disclose your most sensitive personal and private information to us and it is subsequently stolen from our database by a hacker thief please be advised we are not legally liable for such theft or, the subsequent use or abuse of that information.

However, if you choose to willfully volunteer your your most sensitive personal and private information to us, we will not disclose that information to any party, or sell it, or make it public under any circumstances whatsoever.

When under court order, we will provide only the information specified in the court order. This may include your email if it resides on our servers. Although this has never happened to our clients, it has happened to other internet based companies and their clients. Therefore you need to be responsible with your email and consider encrypting important communications by using a secure email service such as hushmail or safe-mail, or, by using the services of a web based provider such as Google, Microsoft or Hotmail.

If you do not give your sensitive personal and private information to us, we cannot provide it to anybody else even if we wanted to. You are responsible for protecting the secrecy of your password and account information.

Although this web site contains links to other web sites we assume no responsibility for the content or privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage you to be cautious if you click on a link to another web site. You should read it’s privacy statement as many web sites do collect personally identifiable information.
