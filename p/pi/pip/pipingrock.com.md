Web beacons allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the third party.

You may be able to disable cookies by changing a setting in your web browser. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of our Site’s features and that your decision to decline cookies from our Site may impact your ability to use other websites as well.

We may combine information collected from tracking devices and the information we collect in our cookies (as described below) with other information we collect about you.

Third parties may place anonymous cookies on the browsers of visitors to our websites and may send their own cookies to the visitor’s cookie file.  Pursuant to global data regulations, Company’s employees have a right of access, modification and erasure of the personal data collected for the sole purpose of the service provision.  These rights may be exercised at [privacy@criteo.com](mailto:privacy@criteo.com)

For your own protection, you should review the policies of similar sites to ensure they meet your personal expectations of privacy.

### How Do We Protect Personal Information?

We maintain commercially reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the information you provide on our Site.

Among other safeguards, we use Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) technology to help protect transmissions over the internet of your payment card data. You can confirm that SSL is being used by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure Site, the first characters of the Site’s address will change from “http” to “https.” If you are using a web browser or a firewall that does not permit communications through our secure Site, you may not be able to make purchases on our Site.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet or stored on a server can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect personal information about you and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of personal information about you. If you prefer not to transmit your credit card number over the internet, you can contact us using the toll-free number listed on the Site.

### Children

The Site is intended for a general audience and is not designed for children under 13 years old. Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our database.

### Miscellaneous

The Site is based in the United States, and therefore, information we collect about you may be stored, processed and accessed in the United States. By using the Site, you consent to the transfer, storage, and processing of personal information about you in the United States.

### Criteo Marketing

The purpose of Criteo Email is to find visitors of Criteo advertising clients’ properties (websites, apps and newsletters) and send them personalized emails.
