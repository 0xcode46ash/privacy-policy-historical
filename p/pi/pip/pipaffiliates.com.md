## Security and Protection of Your “Registered” Information

The personal information you provide us with when registering yourself as a user of the Company’s site(s) and/or of its services is classified as registered information, which is protected in several different ways. You can access your registered information after logging in to the Members Area by entering a username and a password that you select. It is your responsibility to make sure that your password is only known to you and not disclosed to anyone else. Registered information is securely stored in a safe location and only authorised personnel have access to it via a username and a password. All personal information is transferred to the Company over a secure 128-bit SSL connection and thus all necessary measures are taken to prevent unauthorised parties from viewing any such information. Personal information provided to the Company that does not classify as registered information is also kept in a safe place and accessible by authorised personnel only via a username and a password.

You have (subject to certain exceptions) the right to obtain any personal information that the Company holds about you and inform the Company of any perceived inaccuracies. To make a request, please write to us by verifying your identity and specifying what information you require. We will acknowledge your request and respond to it within 40 days of receipt of your application including any applicable fees.

Transmission of information via the internet is not always completely secure but the Company endeavors to protect your personal data by taking serious precautions. Once we have received your information, we will apply procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. Furthermore, the data we collect from you may be transferred to and stored at a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be, among others, engaged in the fulfilment of your requests, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing and processing. The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## Legal Disclaimer

The Company reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by rules and regulations and when the Company believes that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with any judicial and/or other proceedings, court order, legal process served or pursuant to governmental, intergovernmental and/or other regulatory bodies. The Company shall not be liable for misuse or loss of personal information and/or otherwise on the Company’s website(s) that the Company does not have access to or control over. The Company will not be liable for unlawful or unauthorised use of your personal information due to misuse or misplacement of your passwords, negligent or malicious intervention and/or otherwise.

## Changes in this Privacy Statement

Our Privacy Policy Statement is reviewed from time to time to take into account new laws and technologies, changes to our operations and practices, and to ensure that it remains appropriate to the changing environment.

If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy Statement and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
