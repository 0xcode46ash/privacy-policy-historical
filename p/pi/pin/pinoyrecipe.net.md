# Privacy Policy by PinoyRecipe.Net

### PinoyRecipe.net Privacy Policy

PinoyRecipe.net is concerned about your privacy. We do our very best not to infringe upon your freedom to surf the internet. The only information we collect from your surfing is to monitor traffic flow on our sites (which pages are viewed and how often), to maintain security (in case of hacking), and to keep our sites up to date (when broken links are found). IP address is used solely for traffic flow patterns (if there was another way we’d use it - sorry!), browser type/platform is used so we can design our sites so the majority of our visitors can use all of our features - we hate to leave anyone out.

We do use third-party advertising to serve ads on our sites. We do share visitor traffic information to our sites with these companies for the sole purpose of managing and targeting advertisements and for market research analysis on our sites. The third-party advertising companies may use pixel tags (also called clear gifs) to note which pages are more popular than others for advertising purposes. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your computer.

Any information given voluntarily, such as an email address used to sign up for our mailing lists, is used for internal purposes only and is **NEVER, EVER** sold or given to anyone outside of PinoyRecipe.net. Voluntarily submitted addresses may be used for correspondence from PinoyRecipe.net, important changes to the website, or other messages. You may easily opt out of this correspondence by cancelling the service you requested. (mailing list, etc).

Email addresses entered by visitors to send recipes from the website are NOT stored or recorded.

PinoyRecipe.net does maintain relationships with outside companies and websites but your only contact with them is if you click on a banner or link and are redirected to their site ( _which we hope you’ll do to keep_ PinoyRecipe.net _free and minimize our need for advertising_!). We can not control their use of information and urge you to be aware that you will be subject to their privacy policy once leaving our site. While we try to partner with the most reputable companies, we are not responsible for actions. Please feel free to report any misuse of information from outside companies so we can evaluate our partnerships with them.

If you feel that your privacy has been violated in any way by this website, please contact us and let us know.
