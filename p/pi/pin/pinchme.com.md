## Privacy Policy

Effective Date: February 12, 2013

PinchMe Group Inc. ("we", "our", or "us") provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive via our website available at www.pinchme.com (the "Website"). This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Your use of the Website following our posting of a revised Privacy Policy at the URL www.pinchme.com (or other URL linked from the landing page of a Website) will signify and constitute your assent to and acceptance of such revised Privacy Policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, capitalized terms used herein have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service available at http://www.pinchme.com/.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the products or services of our business partners or to any other third parties, even if their products or services are linked to, or embedded within, our Website. We recommend that you review the privacy statements of the other parties with whom you interact.

### 1\. INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE

Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Website, and to communicate with users of our Website (including those users who have subscribed to receive information from us).

When you interact with us, such as by subscribing for our newsletter or e-mail updates or otherwise submitting information to us via the Website, we may ask you for personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or uniquely identify you ("Personal Information"). Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name and e-mail address. We may also collect other information that does not personally identify you ("Non-Identifying Information") when you use the Website, such as your gender, age and household income.

We may use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide and improve the Website, to verify your identity, to respond to your inquiries and otherwise communicate with you about our online services or our business or third party offers that may be of interest to you. For example, we may use your Personal Information to contact you with notifications related to the Website. We may also use your Personal Information for our own data analysis purposes as well as in other ways naturally associated with the circumstances in which you provided the information. We may use Non-Identifying Information for any purpose.

Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other Non-Identifying information. We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other visitors or sources to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Website and to analyze and understand how our Website is used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically.

#### Log Data

When you visit the Website, our servers (or servers controlled by our third party service providers) may automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Website, pages of our Website that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Website, access times and dates, and other statistics. If Log Data is collected, we may use this information for purposes such as to monitor and analyze use of the Website and for the Websiteâ€™s technical administration, to increase our Website's functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor the Website to our visitors' needs. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information.

#### Cookies

Like many online services, we and our third party service providers may use "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we or a third party may transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We or a third party may use cookies to enable certain features of the Website, to better understand how you interact with the Website and to monitor aggregate usage by visitors and web traffic routing on the Website. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the Website you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Website or all functionality of the Website.

### 2\. INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE

Except as noted in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell or share your Personal Information unless we have received your consent. Non-Identifying Information may be provided to other parties.

#### Our Service Providers and Affiliated Companies

We may engage third party companies and individuals to perform services on our behalf (e.g., without limitation, software maintenance services, database management, web analytics, professional advisors, and other services). These third parties may have access to your Personal Information. If they do, this access is provided so that they may perform these tasks on our behalf and they are not authorized by us to otherwise use or disclose your Personal Information, except to the extent required by law. We may also share any of your information, including your Personal Information, with our parent, subsidiary, and/or affiliated companies.

#### Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement

We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of us, our affiliates or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable.

#### Data Transfer

Your information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, we transfer Personal Information to the United States and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

#### Business Transfers

We may sell, transfer or otherwise disclose some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.

### 3\. GENERAL.

#### Changing or Deleting Your Information

If you would like us to change or delete your Personal Information in our system (if any), please contact us and we will attempt to accommodate your request if we do not have any legal obligation or legitimate business reason to retain the Personal Information. See below for contact information. Please note we may retain server/backup copies of all such data and that we may decline to process change or deletion requests that we deem to be unreasonable, or require disproportionate technical effort, or jeopardize the privacy of others.

#### Security

We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect Personal Information from unauthorized access. Please be advised, however, that while we strive to protect your Personal Information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and are not responsible for the theft, destruction or inadvertent disclosure of your personally identifiable information.

#### Third Party Sites and Services

Our Website may contain links to, or content from, third party websites and services. The fact that we link to a website or display third party content is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with any of those third parties, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites or services. These other websites and services may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the other websites you visit.

#### Our Policy Toward Children

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 via the Website. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us via the e-mail address below.
