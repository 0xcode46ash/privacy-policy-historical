# PING : Privacy Policy

### At PING, we respect your privacy.

We will not collect any personal information from you that you do not volunteer, and we are the sole owner of all information collected on this site. We do not sell or rent this information to others, nor is information shared in any way that is not mentioned in this Policy.

### PING websites collect information in ways similar to almost every other website you visit.

One way is to track which pages you visit using cookies, which allow us to improve the design and accessibility of the information on our website. The information collected includes the date and time a link was clicked, the amount of time spent on each page, the phrases typed in when searching the site, the zip codes and city/state combinations typed in when searching for retailers, etc. None of the information recorded in this manner is personally identifiable, and is used only to monitor usage and trends on the PING websites.

Another way information is collected is through The PING Locker Room, which allows users to subscribe to email newsletters, register their PING products, and participate in other community-related activities. Your email address is required during registration, and to ensure that only the legitimate owner of that email address is requesting to join, the email address must be verified by logging in with an assigned password that is emailed to that address. Registration information collected includes your name, address, and other demographic information that is used to help us better understand our membership and improve our products and services.

PING may also collect information that is voluntarily submitted and intended to be displayed on the site for other users to view, such as testimonials, feedback, and surveys. This type of submission may contain some personally identifiable information which will be displayed on the web site. In these cases, the user must indicate that they agree to the Terms of Use before submitting this information.

PING will not ask for credit credit numbers, your Social Security number, or any other type of financial or sensitive identity information. If you receive an email that appears to have come from PING that requests credit card or other financial or sensitive personal information, we recommend that you do not respond to it and that you do not use any links embedded in the email. If you have a question about an email that appears to have come from PING, contact PING by using the toll-free number on our [Contact Us page](https://web.archive.org/about/contactus.aspx), or by submitting an email on that page.

Cookies are also used on The PING Locker Room to keep you logged in and remember you on subsequent visits. We also measure responses to email by tracking when email is opened and which links are clicked (click-thrus). The singular purpose is to determine the level of interest that PING Locker Room members have in the various newsletter topics so that we can continue to deliver relevant information to our membership.

### Cookies are small pieces of information that most websites store on your computer's hard drive.

Cookies are only visible to the server that writes them (i.e. ABC company's cookies cannot be seen by XYZ company). PING.com uses cookies in a very limited context â€” to identify returning visitors and tailor the content or interactivity of web pages accordingly. Cookies also allow PING Locker Room members to access their personal profile and the clubs they have registered on the PING website. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies but allow you to modify security settings so you can approve or reject cookies on a case-by-case basis. Due to the increased functionality allowed, you must have cookies enabled to become a PING Locker Room member and gain access to any Locker Room-related pages (your Profile, Registered Products, etc.).

### PING occasionally works with third parties for fulfillment of mailings submitted for product registration,

and for special offers that Locker Room members have elected to receive. Access to the information you submit is limited to select PING employees and the fulfillment center that processes these mailings. We use reasonable precautions to keep the information you disclose to our website secure, and require confidentiality agreements with the parties we contract with. However, by joining the PING Locker Room and providing registration information, you agree that we are not responsible for any breach of security or for the actions of these parties as long as we notify you if we believe a breach of security has occurred.

### By using our website, you give PING, Inc. permission to collect information about the pages you visit

as an anonymous user for the purpose of calculating aggregate site statistics. If you become a member of the PING Community and register any PING products, you authorize PING to use information you provide to personalize the information we deliver to you and to use your demographic information when calculating aggregate customer data. All mailing lists (subscriptions) are joined on an opt-in basis, and the member has full control of all subscriptions through their personal profile page.

### If you wish to change any information you have submitted to PING
