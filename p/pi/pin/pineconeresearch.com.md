  1. OUR COMMITMENT TO OUR PANELISTS
**

 **We protect the identities of our participants. We will NOT use your personal identifying information to advertise, promote, or market goods or services directly to you and we do not allow our clients to market directly to you.**

“Personal identifying information” means information that by itself – like your likeness, first and last name, home postal address or personal email address – or in combination with other information, could identify a specific individual.

**
  2. WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT
**  

    * **Information you give us.**
      * During the recruitment process, the panel registration process or as part of a research survey, you provide us with personal identifying information about you and your household such as: 
        * Name, phone number, mailing address, and email address.
      * You also provide us with demographic information such as: 
        * Gender, date of birth, marital status, race, occupation, and annual income.
      * Through voluntary participation in our panels and surveys, we collect your behavior and preference data. “Behavior data” is when, why or how you do things. “Preference data” is means the choices you make such as which products you buy. Once your household has joined our panel, we will obtain additional information about you and your household, because we track a wide variety of information about preference and consumption behaviors and exposure to advertising. For example, if your household participates in our healthcare panel, we may collect certain health-related information about you and the members of your household including healthcare services received prescriptions and over-the-counter medications used, the conditions for which these medications are used, and other pharmacy products that you purchase or use.
  

    * **Information we get from other sources.**
      * After you join the panel, we may receive additional information about you from other sources, including other Nielsen measurement products. This may include information such as what you watch or buy, and your exposure to advertising. We obtain this information from many sources, including outside sources. These include, for example,
        * Census data,
        * The manufacturers and sellers of the products you purchase or use,
        * "Loyalty" programs (like those that offer rewards and points),
        * Organizations that collect online data,
        * Data suppliers,
        * Companies that combine purchase information, and
        * Other entities that have a legal right to provide such information to us.
  
We may combine the information from your household with these additional data. We will use this combined information only for the purposes described in this Notice. By participating in this panel, you agree that we may obtain this information about you and combine it in this way.
  

    * **Information from your use of this Site and the Internet.**
      * We may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs or other similar technologies in order to manage PineCone Research and to enhance your experience as a panelist. Session cookies, persistent cookies, and Flash cookies (also known as a Local Shared Objects) may be used in connection with the Site and our research activities. These cookies are used for a variety of purposes, including, without limitation, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, to better serve you with more tailored information, security purposes such as to detect duplicate Panel Members and combat fraudulent participation, as well as for online tracking purposes. We may also use cookies to gather statistical information about the usage of the Site in order to continually improve the design and functionality, to understand how users use the Site, and to assist us with resolving questions regarding the Site. 

Flash cookies are similar to browser cookies, except that they can store data more complex than simple text. Flash cookies, by themselves, cannot do anything to or with the data on your computer. In addition, Flash cookies cannot access or remember your email address or other personal identifying information unless you provide the information on our Site. If you want to delete Flash cookies, you will need to access your Flash Player settings management tool available on Adobe’s website at <http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html>.

  

      * On occasion, we may use non-Flash cookies to understand your exposure to certain Internet advertisements as you surf the Web. You can also set your browser to reject or delete cookies on your computer by following the browser help file directions. Setting your browser to reject cookies or deleting cookies, however, may interfere with your using some features of other web sites and may impair your ability to participate in activities at this site.
  

      * Additionally, we may automatically collect a variety of machine readable information using digital fingerprinting technology. Please see Section D on digital fingerprinting and fraud prevention for more information.
  

      * We may allow our member recruitment vendors to use Web beacons and cookies on our registration pages solely for payment verification purposes. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This Notice covers the use of cookies by PineCone Research and members of the Nielsen family of companies only and does not cover the use of cookies by any of our vendors.

  3. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION
**  

    * Information you provide during the recruitment process is used to determine eligibility for participation in one of our panels. We use panelists’ information we collect to create a variety of research insights for our clients. **We use tools and methods to make sure that there is no reasonable possibility of identifying an individual participant in the reports that we create for our clients.** For example, we combine the responses we collect from you with the responses of others to produce “aggregated” reports. We also create scientific reports based upon modeled information. “Modeled information” is data we have developed based upon demographic and behavioral characteristics (like your gender, age, purchasing habits, and web sites visited) to predict what people with similar or matching characteristics would buy. This allows manufacturers to identify the likely consumers for a marketing campaign. 

If you qualify for a sweepstakes after you join our panel at this website, we will use the email address that you have given us to send you a confirmation of your sweepstakes entry. We will also use your contact information to let you know if you have won. 

Our research insights help our clients make choices about where and how they market their products. Among other things, our solutions have helped clients: 

      * Successfully launch a new product idea 
      * Update an existing product line to better suit consumer needs
      * Identify the types of healthcare products consumers in different demographic groups would be likely to buy
      * Determine the consumers that would be more likely to respond to a particular marketing campaign
      * Understand the makeup of the audience that was shown an advertisement while surfing the Internet or interacting with social media 
  

    * When we contact you – by phone, email, or text, depending on what information you provide to us – we will do so for one of the following reasons: to respond to your inquiries; to validate answers you gave; to update our records to ensure your information is correct; to send you important information regarding your participation such as how to redeem awards and to provide notice regarding changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. When contacting you by phone, we may do so using automatic dialing systems and/or pre-recorded messages. From time to time, we may also send you invitations to join other panels or participate in surveys.
  

    * We may also use the information for business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, developing new products, enhancing our Site, improving our services, identifying usage trends and determining the effectiveness of our communications.

If we combine non-personal identifying information with personal identifying information, the combined information will be treated by us as personal identifying information as long as it is combined.

**
  4. DIGITAL FINGERPRINTING& FRAUD PREVENTION
**

As a quality control measure to maintain the integrity of Internet-based research, we may use a digital fingerprinting technology, also known as "machine identification" technology, to gather certain information about your computer, including, without limitation, your IP address, the type of operating system type/version you are using, your browser type, version and parameter values, your computer configuration, the software and cookies residing on your computer, the display settings on your monitor, and the plug-ins residing on your computer. This information is sent to our trusted third-party partner who converts it into a unique serial number for your computer – the digital fingerprint – through use of a proprietary algorithm and determines if it matches any previous digital fingerprint. We use this technology to assist our clients in ensuring the integrity of our research by detecting duplicate Panel Members or Non-Panel Participants and combating fraudulent participation in Research Activities. Our third party partner also may store Flash cookies (which are discussed above) on your computer solely in connection with its efforts on our behalf to ensure the integrity of our research. We will not use this technology to collect any of your personal identifying information, or track your online activities. Also, our use of this technology will not disrupt or interfere with your use or control of your computer, or alter, modify, or change the settings or functionality of your computer. In furtherance of our efforts to ensure the integrity of our research, we may link or associate a unique identifier to you and/or your Personal Information, share your unique identifier with our clients and with other sample or panel providers, and receive or obtain a unique identifier linked to you from a third party, including without limitation, a sample or panel provider or one of our clients. Any unique identifier(s) received or obtained by us and linked to you will be protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that this technology that we use is safe, secure, and does not cause undue privacy or data security risks, and is conducted in a professional and ethical manner and in accordance with applicable industry standards and laws. If we discover that this technology is not being used in accordance with the foregoing, we will take prompt corrective action.

  5. WHEN WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION
**

We employ third parties who provide services for us such as website or application hosting, data analysis, infrastructure provision, IT services, customer service, email delivery services, credit card processing, auditing services, reward, incentive, sweepstakes, and other similar services. 

We work with other companies for the purposes of data processing or market research product development purposes. They are contractually required to keep that information confidential and are not permitted to use this information for any other purpose except to carry out the services that they are performing for us. _In accordance with market research guidelines, we may also provide individual level information to other companies. If we do, they are bound to keep the information confidential and use it only for research or statistical purposes._

We may disclose your information to other members of the Nielsen family of companies for the purposes described in this Notice.

We will provide your information to a third party if the law requires it or if it allows us to exercise our legal rights or take action regarding potentially illegal activities, or to protect the safety or rights of any person or legal entity. If all or part of our company is sold, merged or otherwise transferred, we may transfer your information as part of that transaction and will take steps to ensure that your information is protected as described in this Notice.
