**  
Customer Information Collected Online** 

Whenever you shop with us online, you are required to provide us with your name, account and shipping address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card numbers and expiration dates.   
We save your information to better service you during an entry in one of our contests, promotions or surveys.  
We maintain a record of your product interests and purchases.   
Your information is collected and used only by pinkice.com and its affiliated brands Pink Ice, Pinkywear, and its parent company California Dream Co., Inc.

**Use of customer information**  

The personal information you submit to pinkice.com is used to first and foremost process your order, confirm your order by email, and/or to contact you as necessary regarding your online shopping.  
We keep your personal information to improve your shopping experience when you return to shop with us online.   
For example, we will save your personal information to maintain your customer account and/or membership to our website so you can log-in to pinkice.com at a later time.  
Additionally, we keep and may use your personal information to keep track of your purchasing preferences and to help us better understand the types of products and services you are interested in so we can better serve you in the future. 

We will use your e-mail and mailing address to send information about upcoming sales, arrival of new products, contests, and promotions.  
If you decide to participate in one of our contests or promotions, we may use your personal information to send you e-mails, postcards, or text messages to your cell phone about our products, contests and promotions. You always have the choice not to receive marketing information or calls.   
Simply let us know that you choose not to be contacted by email, regular mail and/or cell phone text messages, and we will take you off the list. **Do you sell or share my personal information with other third party retailers?**  

With the exception of web-hosting services who maintain and service this website, we do not sell or share your personal information with any third party retailers.  
We contract with service providers (such as web hosting companies) to maintain and manage our website and related customer information.   
We do not authorize any of our service providers to make any other use of your information.  
From time to time, we may have a contest, promotion, or sales program that requires us to collaborate or partner with a marketing company who may require your personal information in order for you to participate in the contest or promotion.  
We will give you the choice not to participate in the contest or promotion, and your personal information will not be shared with our marketing partner if you choose not to participate.

Furthermore, when we conduct internal company audits and marketing analysis, our auditors and/or marketing consultants may require access to your personal information.  
In such case the auditors and consultants will be required to maintain a similar privacy policy to protect your personal information from being shared with third parties, and your personal information will be used internally only for the auditor's and consultant's specific purposes.

Similarly, if we sell or merge our company with another, we will disclose your personal information to the purchaser or company we are merging with, but they will be required to abide by the terms and conditions of this privacy policy.

Finally, the law may require us to disclose your personal information in certain situations. Pinkice.com, Pink Ice, Pinkywear, and California Dream Co., Inc. reserve the right to disclose information about you as required by law, in response to legal process and law enforcement requests, and as necessary to protect the property, interests and rights of Pinkice.com, Pink Ice, Pinkywear, and California Dream Co., Inc., its affiliates, and others.

Any requests to update your personal information may take up to ten (10) days if requested by email or four (4) weeks if requested by postal mail.

**Credit card safeguards**  

Protecting your credit card information is important to us. Our website uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect your credit card information when it is transmitted online to us.  
SSL is currently among the highest standards in internet encryption technology. When you access our online store to make an online purchase, you should see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser).   
The unbroken key or closed lock signifies that the security SSL is active and you may proceed with your online purchase with confidence.   
You can also look at the URL or Location line of your browser to make sure you are at the proper web site page by visually verifying the URL address.

We also take a further measure to protect online transaction from fraud by requiring online customers to enter the credit card's 3 to 4 digit security code (CVV). The CVV code can only be found on the card itself, which further helps to prevent fraudulent online transactions.

**Your liability under the fair credit billing act**  

Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your credit card company or bank cannot hold you liable for more than Fifty dollars ($50.00) of unauthorized or fraudulent charges on a credit card.   
IF YOU EVER BECOME AWARE OF ANY UNAUTHORIZED OR FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY ON YOUR CREDIT CARD, YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY YOUR CREDIT CARD COMPANY AND/OR BANK IN ACCORDANCE WITH YOUR CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT.
