#### Pegasystems is committed to protecting your privacy. 

We are providing this Privacy and Security statement to inform you of our Privacy & Security policy and practices, and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected online and how that information is used. We've structured our corporate Web site, www.pega.com, so that, in general, you can visit us on the Web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. Authentication is required, however, to enter Pegasystems' Support Network (for customers) and Partner Network (for our strategic business and technology partners). 

This statement applies to www.pega.com as well as Pegasystems' Support Network and Partner Network sites; it does not apply to other offline Pegasystems sites, products or services. 

#### 1\. Links to Non-Pegasystems Web Sites

Our Web sites may provide links to third-party Web sites for your convenience and information. If you access those links, you will leave the Pegasystems Web sites. Pegasystems does not control those sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from ours. We do not endorse or make any representations about third-party Web sites. The personal data you choose to give to unrelated third parties is not covered by the Pegasystems Privacy & Security statement. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal information. 

#### 2\. Types of Information We Collect

This Privacy & Security statement covers personal information, non-personal data collection and aggregate reporting.

Providing this additional information is optional.



  * **Non-personal information** is data about usage and service operation that is not associated with a specific personal identity. Pegasystems collects and analyzes non-personal information to evaluate how visitors use the Pegasystems Web sites. 

Non-personal data we collect may include the pages visited on the Pegasystems Web sites, unique URLs visited within www.pega.com, browser type and IP address. Most non-personal data is collected via cookies or other analysis technologies. Pegasystems' Web pages use cookies, Web beacons and other technologies for data analysis and personalization services. Pegasystems also places advertisements on other Web sites that may use cookies. 




Personal data collected online may also be combined with information you provide Pegasystems through other sources such as product registration, call centers or public events such as trade shows or seminars. 

Personal data given to Pegasystems may be transferred across state and country borders for the purposes of data consolidation, storage and simplified customer information management. 

Non-personal data gathered from Pegasystems' Web sites is aggregated for reporting about usability, performance and effectiveness. It is used to improve the customer experience, usability and site content. 

#### 3\. Who We Share Your Information With

Pegasystems will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others. Pegasystems will not share your personal information with third parties except in responding to your requests for products or services. Your permission will be requested when you submit your information.

Pegasystems contracts with third-party service providers and suppliers to deliver complete products, services and customer solutions described above in "Types of Information We Collect". Suppliers and service providers are generally required to keep confidential the information received on behalf of Pegasystems and may generally not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Pegasystems. These service providers may change or we may contract with additional service providers to better accommodate our customers.  

Pegasystems or its related entities could merge with or be acquired by another business entity or some or all of their respective assets could be acquired.
