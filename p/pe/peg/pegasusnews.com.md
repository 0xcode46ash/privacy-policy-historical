PegasusNews logs information about use of the Website, including, but not limited to, IP address, profile information, pages visited, and browser type, from users of the Website.  This data is used for, among other things, to provide customized content to users, provide targeted offers to users, manage the site, track usage and improve the site services. 

Users must provide us, at a minimum, with a valid email address in order to complete the voluntary registration process.  Email addresses are used to send notifications related to the Website and to communicate offers. Registered users may choose not to receive promotional emails from us by changing the “Do not send me promotional emails” setting within their personal profile, although such users may still receive emails from us concerning non-promotional Website communications. Registered users may communicate with each other through the Website without disclosing their email addresses. 

Cell phone numbers are used to send text and voice message notifications related to the Website and to communicate offers. Registered users may choose not to receive text messages from us by not providing their cell phone number to us at registration. Registered users who have provided their cell phone number to us may remove it from within their personal profile settings.   


PegasusNews does not sell or make available any individual user information to unrelated third parties, except to third parties that are providing services to PegasusNews or as provided in the “Sharing and Disclosure of Information” section below.  We may aggregate user information for the purpose of user analyses and inform advertisers of the results of such analyses. In all such instances, PegasusNews will refer only to general, aggregate usage data from these analyses and will never provide specific identifying information. We may also aggregate user information for the purpose of making offers to users that we believe may be of interest to them. 

Third parties can read information voluntarily posted by registered users on the Website.  That information can be used by those third parties to send you unsolicited messages.  PegasusNews has no control over such unsolicited messages.
