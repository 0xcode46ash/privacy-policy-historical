# Privacy Policy - Peace Quarters

Welcome to Peace Quarters, the website of Peace Quarters Media LLC (“Peace Quarters,” “we,” “PQ,” or “us”). Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information that applies to our service and your choices about the collection and use of your information.

## 1. Collection & Using Information

We collect the following types of information about you:

Peace Quarters only collects information you provide directly: We ask for certain information such as your first and last name and e-mail address when you subscribe to us. We may also retain any messages you send through the service, and may collect information you provide in user content you post to Peace Quarters. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of Peace Quarters.

**Information we may receive from third parties  
**We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our website through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking”, that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Peace Quarters. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. If you allow us access to your friends list, your friends’ user IDs, and your connection to those friends, may be used and stored to make your experience more social, and to allow you to invite your friends to use our Service as well as provide you with updates if and when your friends join Peace Quarters. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to Peace Quarters. You may also unlink your third party account from the  by adjusting your settings on the third party service. If you unlink your third party account, we will remove the information collected about you in connection with that service.

**Inviting a friend to use Peace Quarters from the “Invite friends” feature**  
If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a third party to the Service through our “Invite friends” feature, you may directly choose a friend to invite through your mobile device’s native contact list – but we do not require that you import your contacts list, and we do not retain the information contained in your contacts list. You understand that by inviting a friend to Peace Quarters through the “Invite friends” feature, you are directly sending a text or email from your personal accounts and that we are not storing your contact list. In addition, you understand and agree that normal carrier charges apply to communications sent from your phone. Since this invitation is coming directly from your email or phone, we do not have access to or control this communication.

We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for Peace Quarters. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.

**Cookies information**  
When you visit Peace Quarters, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use Peace Quarters, and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.

**Device identifiers**  
When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers,” such as a universally unique identifier (“UUID”). Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Peace Quarters. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through Peace Quarters. Some features of Peace Quarters may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.

When you access the website by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Service. Some features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.

**Commercial and marketing communications**  
We use the information we collect or receive to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions and special offers.

Use of certain service type information we collect about you: We use or may use cookies, log file, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) to provide and monitor the effectiveness of PQ; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; (f) to provide advertising to your browser or device.

We may also share certain information such as your location, browser and cookie data and other data relating to your use of PQ with our business partners to deliver advertisements (“ads”) that may be of interest to you. Peace Quarters may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements to Peace Quarters. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser or mobile device, the ads and ad links that appear on PQ, and will automatically receive your IP address when they do so. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, device identifiers, location data, and clear gifs, see above) to compile information about your browser’s or device’s visits and usage patterns on the Service, and to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize the advertising content. Peace Quarters does not sell, rent, or share the information we collect directly from you or about you from third parties with these third-party ad servers or ad networks for such parties’ own marketing purposes.

Please note that an advertiser may ask Peace Quarters to show an ad to a certain audience of Users (e.g., based on demographics or other interests). In that situation, Peace Quarters determines the target audience and Peace Quarters serves the advertising to that audience and only provides anonymous aggregated data to the advertiser. If you respond to such an ad, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.

The Peace Quarters Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers or contact such advertisers for more information.
