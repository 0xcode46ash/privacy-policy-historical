**2\. Collection and Storage of Information**   
We will collect certain personal information during different activities on this Site or otherwise, such as user registration, when you purchase materials, participate in a survey, contact us with questions or offer feedback on the Site.

**3\. Use of Information**

The information that we collect is used to fulfill a number of legitimate business functions, such as warranty service, product support, notices of new releases and upgrades, as well fulfilling any orders placed by you, to contact you in the event follow-up communications are necessary, to analyze survey results, to verify the statistical accuracy of the survey, to notify you of offers and services, to improve the Site, for development of new products and services, and for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. Sometimes we hire companies to help us analyze survey results and to mail interested parties offers and information on products and services, or for other legitimate business purposes, such as product fulfillment or other third party services. In those instances, we need to share your information with them. These companies will be authorized to use the information in the same manner in which we have been authorized. In rare instances, we will disclose personally identifiable information to necessary parties to protect the Site or visitors to the Site, or to enforce compliance with our Terms and Conditions of Use.

We may share personally identifiable information within the Pearson family of companies. Information concerning individuals' usage of the Site will not be disclosed to third parties except in an aggregate form (e.g., "45% of the visitors to the Site are repeat visitors") or as otherwise permitted under this Privacy Policy. 

We may use the information you provide us to send you email, fax or other communications. These communications may include email newsletters as well as information regarding products or services. All such communications will include instructions explaining how you can "opt out" of future communications of the same type.

We may also disclose personally identifiable information collected on the Site as follows:  


* In the event of an asset sale, merger, restructuring, reorganization, liquidation or similar transaction we may transfer information to the successor company.

*To our contractors.

* When we believe such disclosure is required by law or for the protection of persons or property.  


* With your consent.  


Please be aware that if you disclose personally identifiable information on Website message boards or chat areas, that information may be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited communications from third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Pearson.
