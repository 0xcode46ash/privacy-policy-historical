The extent of employment data collected is set by the administrator of the organization. All information related to the employee can be viewed and edited by the administrators of the organization.

In addition the service collects ratings and feedback from employees as part of the engagement surveys. The purpose of this data collection is to analyze and report the performance and engagement of the organization over time. This is used in conjunction with the employment data to analyze and report differences in performance and engagement between different employee segments, such as department and country.

Data collected from employees are never directly personally identifiable by you, or other you invite to the service, unless the employee has explicitly chosen otherwise. Survey responses are entirely optional, individual or all questions can be skipped and there are no requirement that the surveys must be completed.

Engagement data collected from the employees, are used in an aggregated and anonymized form to serve as benchmark data for other organizations within the same industry.
