Thank you for visiting the Peach and Lily website. Peach and Lily, Inc. (“Peach and Lily,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy.

We at Peach and Lily created this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared.  This Privacy Policy relates to the information collection and use practices of Peach and Lily in connection with our website located at **[www.peachandlily.com](http://www.peachandlily.com/) **(the “Site”), and the Service.

**Information We Collect    **

We do not collect any personal information from you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. The information that we may collect on the Site allows us to improve your shopping experience by catering to your personal preferences.

When you sign up to become a Registered User, you will be asked to provide us with certain personal information, such as your name, email address, postal address, credit card and other payment related information. In this Privacy Policy, we refer to all of this information as “Personal Information.”

Like most web sites, we use automatic data collection technology when you visit our Site to record information that identifies your computer, to track your use of our Site, and to collect certain basic information about you and your surfing habits. This information includes information about your operating system, your IP addresses, browser type and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, keywords, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, what sections of a website you visit, and similar information concerning your use of the Site and the Service (the “Usage Information”). 

We may collect this Usage Information by using cookies. Cookies are small packets of data that a web site stores on your computer’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visit. You can reject cookies by following the directions provided in your Internet provider’s “help” file.  If you reject cookies, you may still visit the Site, but may not be able to use some areas of the Site and/or the Service.

We do not collect personally identifying information in this way, but if you’ve provided us with personally identifying information we may associate that information with the information that is collected automatically. Automatic data collection may be performed on our behalf by our services providers.

**How We Use Your Information**

We may also share personal information, demographic information, and purchase history that you provide to Peach and Lily with our strategic partners, such as suppliers and distributors, in order to select the best products for you and our customers. Any strategic partners that are given access to your personal information is contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality of the information shared with them and to strictly use the information to perform the services that we ask them to provide to us and you.

We may provide aggregate statistics, which do not include personal information, about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related Site information to reputable third party vendors. 

We, like many businesses, sometimes hire other companies to perform certain business-related functions.  Examples include mailing information, maintaining databases, hosting services, and processing payments.  When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.  We require such third parties to maintain the confidentiality of such information and use such information only as necessary to provide us with designated services.

If we or all or substantially all of our assets are acquired, we expect that the information that we have collected, including personally identifying information, would be transferred along with our other business assets.

We may disclose Personal Information and Usage Information to government authorities, and to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities, at our discretion, or otherwise as required by law, including but not limited to in response to court orders and subpoenas. We also may disclose Personal Information and the Usage Information when we have reason to believe that someone is or may be causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other users of this Site, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.

**How We Protect Your Information**

We take commercially reasonable steps to protect the Personal Information and the Usage Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable.
