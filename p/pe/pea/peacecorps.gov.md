###  Information Collected for Website Improvement and Customization (i.e., “Cookies)

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) [Memorandum 10-22, Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies (PDF)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-22.pdf), allows federal agencies to use session and persistent cookies to improve the delivery of services.

The Peace Corps uses cookies to collect information about users’ visits to our site. Use of these technologies makes our web site function better for you and allows us to better understand how the public is using the web site. Cookies are files placed on your hard drive by a web site that store information regarding your use of that site, usually without your express knowledge.

The Peace Corps uses "session cookies," also known as "Tier 1 web measurement and customization technologies," and "persistent cookies," also known as "Tier 2 web measurement and customization technologies". These cookies do not collect personal information on users. Session cookies are stored in memory during an active browser session, and they are erased as soon as you close your browser after visiting our web site. Persistent cookies can stay on your computer for longer periods of time unless you deletes them.

The Peace Corps uses third-party analytics tools (currently Google Analytics and iPerceptions) to collect and analyze anonymous statistical data. This data helps the Peace Corps meet user needs, understand web traffic patterns and identify opportunities to improve the quality of the site. The Peace Corps uses anonymous, aggregated data for internal purposes and discloses it to Peace Corps employees and contractors who need to know the information in the performance of their official duties.

_Google Analtyics:_

Google Analytics uses a persistent cookie to store a unique, randomly assigned identifier for each user. The persistent cookie remains on users’ computers for two years or until it is deleted. Additionally, Google Analytics uses session cookies to facilitate sending data to Google Analytics. Google Analytics does not receive personally identifiable information (PII) through these cookies and does not combine, match, or cross-reference peacecorps.gov information with any other information. The data is automatically sent from your machine or device to the provider’s system which immediately aggregates that data.

Google Analytics also gathers anonymous summary demographic information about our visitors such as gender, age range, and areas of interest for adults over the age of 18. This information is collected by using Google Demographic and Interests reports. When you visit a website that has partnered with the Google Display Network, Google stores a number in your browser using a persistent cookie to remember your visits. This number uniquely identifies a web browser, not a specific person. Browsers may be associated with a demographic category, such as gender or age range, based on the sites that were visited. This demographic information is used to help us better understand our visitors' interests and needs to more effectively develop content to serve you.

_iPerceptions_ :

iPerceptions gathers information through an optional survey on peacecorps.gov. iPerceptions utilizes session and persistent cookies, none of which collect PII. If you accept the survey invitation, two session cookies store information relating to the survey control and operation. The information is submitted when you complete the iPerceptions survey and submit your response. If you decline the survey invitation, or do not complete the survey, this information is never submitted to iPerceptions. The session cookies are deleted at the end of your session on peacecorps.gov.

iPerceptions uses a persistent cookie to prevent multiple pop-up survey invitations. If you decline the survey invitation, or if you complete the survey, this cookie will prevent additional pop-up invitations for 90 days.

You may opt out of having the iPerceptions cookies installed on your machine or device by changing the setting of your browser to block them. You may also opt out of all Google Analytics tracking by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. Even if you disable cookies, Google Analytics can still gather data about your website usage. The add-on instructs Google Analytics to prohibit sending information to Google Analytics. The browser add-on is available for most modern browsers. For instructions on how to block cookies from common browsers and additional information please visit: <http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml>.

If you choose to block these technologies you will continue to have access to comparable information and services on our web site.

###  GovDelivery

Peace Corps also uses GovDelivery to send e-newsletters, alerts and other messages to visitors who subscribe to them. To subscribe to a Peace Corps product, you must provide an email address and indicate your subscription preferences, including the items you want to receive. The email subscriber lists are password-protected by GovDelivery. Only the Peace Corps managers who send newsletters, alerts or memos via GovDelivery and staff members who monitor the results of GovDelivery email initiatives have access to the subscriber lists. GovDelivery never allows access to the subscriber lists to anyone outside of the Peace Corps for any purpose. GovDelivery collects and provides non-identifying information about the number of messages sent, clicks and open rates. This information is password-protected and only available to designated Peace Corps staff who require this information to perform their duties. The GovDelivery privacy policy is available at: http://www.govdelivery.com/legal-privacy.
