# Privacy Statement | Personal Excellence

The objective of this privacy statement is to openly disclose the type of information gathered by this site (Personal Excellence, thereafter referred to as “PE”) and how the information is perused.

In short, all your personal information is kept secret and never shared with anyone else.

## How Information is Gathered

### 1\. Electronic newsletters

PE offers free electronic newsletters which users have to opt-in to sign up. During sign up, the user is required to supply his/her first name and email address. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the unsubscribe link provided in every newsletter.

### 2\. Forums

PE provides forums where users can interact with each other. Users must register (free of charge) in order to post and reply to messages, although they do not need to register to read the messages. During registration, the user is required to supply a username, password, and email address. These details are only used for forum usage purposes, such as notification of new replies on subscribed threads, notification of new private messages by other users, and so on.

### 3\. “E-mail this to a friend”

Users can electronically forward a link or page to someone else by clicking “e-mail this to a friend”. The user must provide his/her names and email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is only used to let the recipient know who sent the email.

### 4\. User tracking

PE tracks user information (IP, Internet Service Provider, country, browser type, computer resolution, etc) and user usage behavior (search terms used before landing on the site, average pageviews, time spent per page, total time spent on the site, pages visited, etc) throughout our sites. The information is only used on an aggregated level, at times broken down into category buckets, to improve the service. The information is never associated with individual users.

### 5\. Cookies

PE may place a text file called a “cookie” in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain personal information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can’t read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. PE uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described in #4).

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you have set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site. However, you do need cookies enabled to have a seamless usage experience of the forums.

### **6\. Order Forms**

PE provides order forms to buy products. With each order, this site collects contact information (like your email address), and financial information (like your credit card number). Contact information is used to contact you when necessary, such as when there is a problem with the order. Financial information is used to bill you for the order.

### 7\. Commenting

PE allows users to post comments to articles or posts. With each comment, the user must provide his/her name (or alias), email address, and website address (optional). The name or alias is only used for identification purposes among other commenters. Email address is used to notify the user in the case where his/her comment is to receive a response.

### 8\. Polling

PE offers polls from time-to-time to gather user feedback and users’ opinions of topics. Responses are aggregated and not identifiable to any particular user. PE may use IP-tracking so users can vote only once per poll. The IPs are not used for any other purposes.

## Use of Information

PE uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.

We use information that users voluntarily provide to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls and forums. We send out newsletters to subscribers whenever there are new posts, and occasionally send out special announcements in the case of new product launches, special offers, or new challenges.

When we use tracking information, it is to build a better service for you. Information is always used on an aggregated basis, sometimes broken down by category buckets, but never associated with individual users.

PE never shares user information with any third parties, including advertisers or partners.

## Security

PE operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by users. We do not store any credit card or financial information for orders.

## Opt-out Policy

At any time, users are free to opt-out of having their information collected. Such choices include:

  1. Opting not to register to receive our electronic newsletters.
  2. Opting not to participate in interactive areas like forums, polls or challenges.
  3. Disabling cookies on the browser.



## Your Consent

By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by PE. Any changes to the privacy policy will be duly reflected on this page.
