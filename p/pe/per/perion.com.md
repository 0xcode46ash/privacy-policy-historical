To better protect your privacy, We provide this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) explaining Our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this Site. This Privacy Policy forms part of the Terms of Use, available at [www.perion.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20111112044644id_/http%3A//www.perion.com/www.perion.com) By using this Site or the Service you consent to the data practices described in this Privacy Policy.

**THE SITE**  
We do not request nor collect any personal information from users who simply visit the Site.  
We are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) you share with Us.  
“Personal Information” means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, pen name, personal profile, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information.  
Currently, We do not require you to create an account or to provide Personal Information in order to have access to information available on Our Site. However, in the future, in order to provide you with certain services given under the Site, you might be required to create an account (“Account”) and provide Us with your email address, a password that you will use for your Account and other specified information. In such case We will send you an email to your email address to instruct you how to confirm your registration.

****THE WAY WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION****  
In the event that you will submit Personal Information to Us through the Site, We will use your Personal Information to improve Our services to you, to contact you and to identify and authenticate your access to the Site’s services that you are authorized to access.  
We may transfer your Personal Information within Perion or to Perion third-party service providers, but only to provide services on the Site or to you, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.  
We may provide Personal Information and non-personally-identifiable information to Our directors, officers, employees, subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on Our behalf. We will require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with Our Privacy Policy, and We will use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.  
We may also use your email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding Our developments. You may choose not to receive email of this type by sending a single email with the subject “BLOCK” to [vipsupport@perion.com](mailto:vipsupport@perion.com).  Please note that the email must come from the email account you wish to block.

**COOKIES**  
Some of Our Site pages utilize “cookies” and other tracking technologies. “Cookies” are pieces of information that are placed on an individual’s computer hard drive to enable the individual to more easily communicate and interact with the Service and Web Site.  
Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information previously indicated by a Site user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.  
You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter certain identifying information, should We in the future require such information, to gain access to certain parts of the Site.  
Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that Our Site is accessed.  
Perion may use cookies to save certain information about a user and others who visit the Site, in order to facilitate and enhance future activities with the Site, to improve Our Site and your web experience. Perion does not use cookies to retrieve information from a computer that is unrelated to the Service.  
Perion currently contracts with several online partners to help manage and optimize its Internet business and communications. Perion uses the services of a marketing company to help it measure the effectiveness of its advertising and how visitors use this Site. To do this, Perion uses Web beacons and cookies provided by Perion’s marketing company on the Site. The type of information Perion collects includes the pages visited. By supplementing Perion ‘s records, this information helps Perion learn things like what pages are most attractive to visitors of the Site. Although Perion’s marketing company manages the information coming from the Site on behalf of Perion, Perion controls how that data may and may not be used.  
We may use an outside advertising company to display advertisements on the Site. These ads may contain cookies, web beacons, clear gifs or similar technologies to help present such advertisements, and to help measure and research the advertisements’ effectiveness. The advertisement company may collect cookies received with outside ad banners. We do not have access to information that would confirm the use of cookies by the advertising company. The use of these technologies by these third party ad servers is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by Our Privacy Policy.

**IP ADDRESSES**  
An Internet Protocol address is a number that’s automatically assigned to a computer when using the Internet. Web servers can automatically identify individual computers by their IP address. Perion may collect IP addresses to Facilitate system administration, diagnose system problems, report aggregate user information and avoid hacking attacks on the Perion server.  
Perion does not link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information, even if such information is voluntarily provided by a user.

**OTHER WEB SITES; LINKS**  
The Site may contain links to other Web sites. Perion is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.  
The Site also links to 3rd party e-commerce solutions that collect the purchaser’s name, email address, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date when ordering licenses to Perion products. This allows them to process and fulfill orders and provide notification of the order status.

**NOTICE**  
Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, We do not currently provide your Personal Information to third parties, except for third parties who may perform services on the Site or to you.  
Nevertheless, We may at a later time choose to make certain offers or services available to Our users from third parties. If We do, during the registration process, if any, and at certain points thereafter in connection with specific offers, We may ask you whether your Personal Information may be sent to third parties who have products, services and opportunities which may be useful to you. If you give your permission to allow third parties to contact you, your Personal Information (such as your contact information and other information collected during your visit to Our Site) may be shared with data aggregators, marketers (possibly in the form of list rental), and other organizations. Perion does not intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on Perion‘s behalf unless such transfer is legally required. Regardless of your decision regarding the sharing of your Personal Information, We may share broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information with Our business partners. This aggregate information does not contain any Personal Information that can identify an individual user.

**CONSENT TO PROCESSING**  
Users, including without limitation, users in the European Union, fully understand and unambiguously consent to the collection and processing of their personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information, in the United States.

**LEGAL DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION**  
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Perion shall, pursuant to valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order, allow access to all available and relevant information, including users’ IP addresses, in order to comply with such valid legal process and to otherwise protect Perion’s rights and property. If warranted, Perion may also allow access to this information in special emergencies where physical safety is at risk.

**SECURITY**  
While there is no such thing as “perfect security” on the Internet, we will take all reasonable steps to insure the safety of your personally identifiable information.

**CHOICE; OPT OUT**  
Our Site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving certain communications from us. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please contact our customer service center by clicking here.  
In addition, You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information Perion.

**ACCESS/ACCURACY**  
To the extent that you do provide Us with Personal Information, Perion wishes to maintain accurate Personal Information.

**CHILDREN’S PRIVACY**  
The Site is not structured to attract children under the age of 13. Accordingly, We do not intend to collect Personal Information from anyone We know to be under 13 years of age.

**IN THE EVENT OF MERGER, SALE, OR BANKRUPTCY**  
In the event that Perion is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, We reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information We have collected from Our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of Our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors’ rights generally, We may not be able to control how your Personal Information is treated, transferred, or used.
