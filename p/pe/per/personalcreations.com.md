To protect the information you send with your order, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL encrypts the information you send over the Internet so only Personal Creations can decode it. If your browser doesn't allow communication through secure servers, please place your order by phone at 1-800-326-6626. Please do not email your credit card information, because email is not encrypted.
