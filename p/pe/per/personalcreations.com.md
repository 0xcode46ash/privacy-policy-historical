**Use of Cookies**  
A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a web server to a user's browser so it can later "remember" specific information.

No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. They do not know the name, phone number, address, email address, or any personally identifying information about the user.

We will only cover this liability if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made while using the secure server.
