PersonnelToday.com is owned and operated by [Reed Business Information Limited](http://www.reedbusiness.co.uk/) ("RBI") . 

Information we collect from users of the site will be stored by us on computers in the UK and the USA and may be used in the following ways:

**Contact details**

If you provide them, we will use your contact details (your name, job title, telephone and fax number and your e-mail and postal addresses) to provide any services requested by you and also to tell you about important changes to the site and its functionality. 

**Voluntary information**

We may ask for further information about you as part of online surveys or if you enter any competition or other promotional feature.

**Cookies**

We make use of cookies to gather valuable information about how users move around the site. This enables us to understand how the site is used and to make improvements. The information we gather by use of cookies does not include personally identifying information. 

In addition, the third party companies who sell and provide advertisements to the site and host our contacts database make use of cookies for the purpose of serving and targeting advertisements more effectively. For more information about these cookies, how you can opt out of receiving them and how this will affect your use of website, please visit the websites of our third party suppliers [Doubleclick](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/privacy/default.asp) and [E2](http://www.e2communications.com/aboute2/privacyPol.asp?Page=Privacy).

**Statistical information**

Aggregate statistical information provided by us to our advertisers or others regarding sales or website usage will not include personally identifying information.

**Access to data**

You have the right to be told what personal information we hold about you on our databases. You should write to us, PersonnelToday.com at Reed Business Information Ltd, Quadrant House, The Quadrant, Sutton, Surrey SM2 5AS stating your full name, your address and all publications or services from RBI to which you know you subscribe. A small administrative charge will be made for fulfilling this request.

**JOBS BY EMAIL AND CV DATABASE**

In addition to the privacy notes above, users who are registered to use our jobs-by-email and online CV services should note the following:

**Registration details** : Contact details and other information you supply as part of the registration process are stored by us and used to provide you with the information you have requested. These details will also be used to tell you about changes to the service or additions to the website. 

**To alter your details** : If your personal information changes you can alter your details by using the 'my jobs file' facility in the jobs area. 

**CV Information:** If you post your CV to our database and you consent to making it available, it will be accessed, either via an online search over the Internet or by way of a general email broadcast, by customers who may be direct recruiters, employment consultants or other organisations who pay us for such access. 

Your CV can only be viewed by a PersonnelToday.com customer if you have consented to this and you may indicate at any time, by using the facility in the 'my online CV' section, that you no longer wish your CV to be available. 

Additionally the 'my online CV ' section will list all customers who are eligible to search the CV database at that time, and you may select those organisations to which you do not wish your CV to be made available. **IMPORTANT:** The number and identity of organisations eligible to search the CV database changes continuously. You must ensure that organisations you deem unsuitable do not receive your CV by using the 'my online CV ' feature outlined above. 

We also rely on you to ensure that your CV and contact details are kept up-to-date. You should update your CV at least every three months, or as soon as your contact details change. 

**A note about applying for jobs by email** : Email messages may not be secure and may be intercepted by third parties. If you apply for a job by email containing confidential information about yourself, you agree that you do so at your own risk and will not hold Reed Business Information responsible for any loss that you suffer as a result.
