The Perth Mint does not disclose personal information about any of its customers to any unrelated third party businesses. We do not sell, rent, lease, loan, trade or otherwise divulge the addresses on our lists to unrelated third parties or any unauthorised personnel. 

Information may be disclosed to authorised government and legal authorities, and authorised contractors conducting business on behalf of the Mint and its customers.

The Mint takes privacy very seriously, and only uses ecommerce and internet products endorsed or recommended by the major banking and technology sector organisations. Furthermore, it follows industry recommended best practice procedures and continually upgrades and improves the methods used on this website.

**Collecting Information**  
Personal information, such as your name and e-mail address, is collected only to record and process your order, and, if you chose to join as a Perth Mint Priority Member, to keep you informed of new product releases and events at the Mint. 

Information about IP addresses, web browsers, and computer operating systems are automatically transmitted to web servers as an integral part of the operation of the internet. This information is used for demographic purposes as a technical resource to better serve web site users. Data is analysed for trends and statistics, and then discarded. Our Web site logs are not personally identifiable and we make no attempt to link them with the individuals that actually browsed the site. For security purposes, network management and to improve our service we use software and third party services to monitor network traffic, detect unauthorised and malicious access of the site, and determine the effectiveness of our site structure.

Credit card details are not stored on this website. Transactions are processed through the national merchant gateway authorised by the four major Australian banks. **Security**  
Personal information provided to The Perth Mint Online Shop is encoded using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, a powerful encryption protocol that protects data as it travels over the Internet. Credit card transactions are processed using the secure EFTPOS network. For enhanced security, we recommend using the latest Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer browsers, which enable SSL. Make sure to set your browser's preferences to accept cookies and enable JavaScript. **Cookies**
