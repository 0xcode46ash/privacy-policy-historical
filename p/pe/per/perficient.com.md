# Privacy Policy | Perficient, Inc.

**Your privacy on Perficient.com**

Perficient is committed to protecting your privacy and implementing technology that gives you a rewarding and safe online experience. We want you to feel secure when visiting our site and are committed to maintaining your privacy when doing so. 

**What information do we gather and how do we use it?**

Information on Perficient.com and other Perficient websites is gathered in two ways: directly and indirectly. Perficient will at times ask you to directly provide information that personally identifies you (registering for an event, downloading a file, signing up for an email list, etc.). It is our policy to keep personal information only as long as needed to fulfill the purposes for which the information was collected.

We also collect information indirectly through our Internet access logs. When you visit Perficient.com, your Internet Protocol (IP) address is automatically collected and is placed in our Internet access logs. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. Your IP address is used to help diagnose any technical problems, analyze site trends, administer the site, track movement within the site, and gather broad demographic information about site use that can eventually be used to make improvements that enhance your user experience on Perficient.com. 

Perficient does not sell, exchange, trade or give away personal information you voluntarily provide to us to any outside sources.

**Access to your information**

You are entitled to know whether we hold information about you and, if we do, to have access to that information and require it to be corrected if it is inaccurate. You can do this by sending us an e-mail.

**Opt-out information**

Perficient may send email communication regarding events, its services, news, etc. We will always provide email recipients a clear and easy means to opt-out of receiving any future communication.

**Site security**

We take appropriate steps to provide and maintain a secure website. By visiting Perficient.com, however, you agree that the open nature of the Internet is such that data may flow over networks without security measures in place and may be accessed and used by people other than those for whom the data is intended.

**Your acceptance of these terms**

By using Perficient.com or any of its family of websites, you provide your consent to the Perficient Internet Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this policy at any time at our discretion. Please check this page periodically for changes.
