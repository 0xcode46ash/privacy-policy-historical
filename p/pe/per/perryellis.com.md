## Does Perry Ellis disclose your Personal Information to others?

Perry Ellis International does not sell, rent or trade with third parties any Personal Information you provide to us, nor do we share such Personal Information with third parties except for the express purpose of assisting us in fulfilling your transactions and customer service inquiries, updating your customer information record in our database, deploying our promotional offers to you, or fulfilling your request to unsubscribe from our email.

Perry Ellis honors every request to unsubscribe from receipt of emails within ten (10) days of receiving the request, not only for promotional emails that Perry Ellis sends, but also for emails about Perry Ellis that we permit other companies to send to their own list of subscribers. As such, in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, Perry Ellis will provide to such companies the email address of anyone who has submitted to Perry Ellis an unsubscribe request, provided such company agrees not to disclose or use such email address for any other purpose than honoring your request to not receive Perry Ellis promotional emails.

Perry Ellis reserves the right to use and/or disclose to others Personal Information about your demographics and use of our website in a manner that does not reveal your identity.
