### Does Perry Ellis use cookies or other tracking technologies?

We use cookies, web beacons (also known as pixel tags) and other technologies to speed your navigation of the Site, recognize your computer and your access privileges, understand your Site usage, and help make the Site more user-friendly, efficient, and secure.  Cookies are small data files or small bits of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive when you visit our Site so that we can recognize you. Web beacons assist in delivering cookies and help us determine whether a web page on the Site has been viewed and, if so, how many times.

The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how you may prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive new cookies or how to disable cookies altogether. However, Perry Ellis is not responsible for and does not guarantee the effectiveness of browser tools.

We also use these technologies to control the number of times you see a given ad, to deliver ads and other product offers and suggestions to you that relate to your interests, product selections or purchases, and measure the effectiveness of various offers and ad campaigns. In all cases, this information helps us serve you better by improving our Site design, as well as our products, services, contests, and promotions. If you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of these services.

We may use third-party service providers to help tailor Site content to you or to serve ads or product offers on our behalf. These service providers may employ cookies and other technologies to measure advertising effectiveness (such as which web pages are visited or what products are purchased and in what amount). Any information that these third parties collect via cookies, web beacons and other technologies is not linked to any Personal Information collected by us. To learn more about interest-based ads and opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from third parties, click here: [www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

Do Not Track

Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers, allowing users to opt out of tracking by websites and online services. At the present time, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not yet established universal standards for recognizable DNT signals and therefore, Perry Ellis and the Site do not recognize DNT. 

### How can you access your information?

You may access and edit the Personal Information that you provide online when you authenticate your right to access by signing in on the Site. Simply click on [My Account](https://web.archive.org/on/demandware.store/Sites-perryellis-Site/default/Account-Show) from the home page and enter your email address and password to access your information.

Perry Ellis follows industry-standard data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect the security of Personal Information collected and stored on our Site from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction.  All Personal Information input by you and transmitted to our Site when you place an order or provide Personal Information is protected by password and by an encryption using Secure Socket Layer Technology ("SSL"). SSL encrypts your order and Personal Information before it is transmitted to us to avoid the decoding of your information by anyone other than Perry Ellis.
