                                                                                                        Rev. 01/12
FACTS               WHAT DOES PERSONAL CAPITAL DO
                    WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Why?                Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law
                    gives consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us
                    to tell you how we collect, share, and protect your personal information. Please read
                    this notice carefully to understand what we do.
What?               The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the product or
                    service you have with us. This information can include:
                            Social Security Number and Income
                            Account Balances and Payment History
                            Credit History and Credit Scores
                            Investment objective and profile information (such as your name, date of birth
                             and contact information)
                            Tax data, such as investment securities cost basis and income tax bracket
                            Encrypted log-in credentials for purpose of auto-login
                            Service and device usage
                            Other appended or shared profile information
                    For our Personal Financial Advisor Service, we do not collect or share the first three
                    bullet items above; however, we may collect and share all of the above information to
                    provide our Investment Advisory Services.
                    When you are no longer our customer, we will continue to share your information as
                    may be required by law.
How?                All financial companies need to share customers’ personal information to run their
                    everyday business. In the section below, we list the reasons financial companies can
                    share their customers’ personal information; the reasons Personal Capital chooses to
                    share; and whether you can limit this sharing.
