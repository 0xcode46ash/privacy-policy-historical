When you receive newsletters or promotional emails from Perforce Software, we may use customized links to determine whether such email has been opened and which links you click, to enable us to provide you with more focused email communications or other information.

Cookies contain information that is transferred from a web page server to your browser via the HTTP protocol and then stored on your computer's hard drive.
