**Privacy Policy**

At PETCO we are concerned with protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to provide a personalized shopping experience. We may also use it to tell you about special offers we think you'd appreciate. You'll never have to worry about receiving a barrage of unexpected e-mail from us. We will not sell, rent or trade your information.

When registering with petco.com, we will ask for some contact information, such as your name and e-mail address. We will use the customer contact information from the registration form to send you information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. If you do not wish to receive future mailing, see the "Choice/Opt-Out" section below. 

Sometimes you will provide us with data that doesn't reveal your personal identity - what type of pet you're interested in, for example. We use this sort of information for editorial purposes, and occasionally for other internal purposes (maybe we'll show cat owners a certain ad, for example) but we do not connect it to any name, address or other personal identifying information. This way we can give you customized information without compromising your privacy. 

We reserve the right to use aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group. For instance, we might report to potential advertisers that a certain percentage of our users are interested in parrot behavior, based on online surveys or other requests. 




**Surveys, Contests, and Other Special Programs**

Our online surveys may ask visitors for contact information (like your e-mail address) and demographic information (like your zip code or age). We use contact data from our surveys to send users information about PETCO and our promotions. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the "Choice/Opt-Out" section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. 

From time to time we may conduct contests or other promotions or request material for publication. To participate, you usually must supply us with your true identity, which you agree to have publicly associated with your submission. The exact rules vary from case to case, and will be noted clearly on the relevant pages. Your participation will always be voluntary and knowing. 

We may also run contests on our site in which we ask you for contact information in order to notify contest winners.




**Links to Other Sites**

This site may contain links to other sites. PETCO is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 




**Kids**

Be sure to ask your parents for permission before you send any information about yourself over the Internet, such as: your name, address, phone number, or e-mail address, to us or to anyone else. 




**Parents**

We are committed to protecting your children's privacy. If petco.com knowingly collects personally identifying data from children, we will use it for internal purposes only. We will not post it, publish it, or supply it to any third parties. As mentioned earlier, for certain purposes we may use anonymous, aggregated data about our users. Kids' information may be included in this aggregated data, but will not be personally identifiable. 




**Choice/Opt-Out**

petco.com provides you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us. 

If you want to remove your information from our database to not receive future communications or to no longer receive our services, you can send an e-mail to majordomo@digitaria.com with the text "unsubscribe petco-news" optionally followed by your e-mail address. 




**Changes to Our Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time; notices of changes will appear on this page at least 30 days in advance, so check back often. Any such changes will not be retroactive.
