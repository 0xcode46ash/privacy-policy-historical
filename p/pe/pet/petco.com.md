**Security**  


PETCO.com takes reasonable steps to protect our customers' data against unauthorized access using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect your online order information.

To check the security of your connection, look at the bottom of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), SSL is active. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https." (Please note: some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers, so you would be unable to connect to our servers to place an order.)

**California Privacy Rights**  
Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California have the right to request from a business, with whom the California resident has an established business relationship, certain information with respect to the types of personal information the business shares with third parties for direct marketing purposes by such third party and the identities of the third parties with whom the business has shared such information during the immediately preceding calendar year. Under California law, California residents who have an established business relationship with PETCO, may choose to opt out of PETCO disclosing personal information about them to third parties for marketing purposes.

**Privacy Policy**  


At PETCO.com, we are concerned with protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to provide a personalized shopping experience. We may also use it to tell you about special offers that we think you'd appreciate if you are subscribed to our newsletters. You'll never have to worry about receiving a barrage of unexpected email from us if you have not subscribed with us. We will not sell, rent or trade your information.

We occasionally have third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates and joint ventures that perform functions on our behalf. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, and are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of the data. They are restricted from using this data for other purposes, and in any way other than to provide the requested services to PETCO.com, and may not alter or resell the data. You may elect to opt-out of personally identifiable site tracking activity by following the Opt-out link below. Keep in mind that PETCO.com may continue to collect anonymous aggregate site behavior from our customers. [Opt-out](javascript:OpenWindow\('/page.aspx?PC=optoutpopup',530,480,'optoutpopup',2\);)

We may occasionally have third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates or joint ventures offer promotions on PETCO.com. You have the option to specifically opt-in to participate in the promotion and share your personal data with these parties and PETCO.com. These promotions may be in the form of a survey, contest or a separate area offering you the opportunity to enter your data for the specific purpose of participating in that program or promotion. Data collected by these third-parties will be covered under the third-party's Privacy Policy agreement.

There is a possibility that PETCO.com, its subsidiaries, its joint ventures, its affiliates, or any combination of such, could merge with, acquire, or be acquired by another business entity. If such an action occurs, PETCO.com would like to let you know that some or all of the personal information collected about you would be shared with this entity in order to continue to provide reliable service. Notice of such an event will be posted on this page, and we will require that all parties follow the practices disclosed in this Privacy Policy unless otherwise noted.

When registering with PETCO.com, we will ask for some contact information, such as your name and email address. We will use the customer contact information from the registration form to send you information about our company and some of our partners. If you do not wish to receive future mailing, see the "Choice/Opt-Out" section below.

Sometimes you will provide us with data that doesn't reveal your personal identity - what type of pet you're interested in, for example. We use this sort of information for editorial and personalization purposes, and occasionally for other internal purposes (maybe we'll show cat owners a certain ad, for example) but we do not connect it to any name, address or other personal identifying information. This way we can give you customized information without compromising your privacy.

We reserve the right to use aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group. For instance, we might report to potential advertisers that a certain percentage of our users are interested in parrot behavior, based on online surveys or other requests.

We use a third party agent to handle our email marketing and you may refer to their privacy policy [here](http://www.e-dialog.com/about_us_policy.html).

If we know a visitor is under the age of thirteen, we will collect a parent's permission offline (by postal mail, fax or phone) before we collect or share personal information with anyone else.

Please note that nowhere on the website do we knowingly collect contact information or financial information from children under the age of 13.

**Email Notice**  
Email, in general, is not a secure form of communication, and can be intercepted as it travels across the Internet. DO NOT send credit card numbers or other sensitive information via email.

**Surveys**  
Our online surveys may ask visitors for contact information (like your email address) and demographic information (like your zip code or age). We use contact data from our surveys to send users information about PETCO.com and our promotions. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the "Choice/Opt-Out" section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitors' experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. 

From time to time we may conduct contests or other promotions or request material for publication. To participate, you usually must supply us with your true identity, which you agree to have publicly associated with your submission. The exact rules vary from case to case, and will be noted clearly on the relevant pages. Your participation will always be voluntary and knowing. Contact information will be used in order to notify contest winners.

**Cookies and How We Use Them**  
You may have read about "cookies," nuggets of information that a Web site you visit will store on your own computer. PETCO.com uses cookies so that we can recognize you and serve you better when you shop at our site. 

Your cookie contains such information as your billing and shipping addresses and the contents of your shopping cart. It does not include your credit card number. 

At PETCO.com, we believe that the use of cookies is essential to a seamless online shopping experience. For that reason, it is not possible to purchase items at PETCO.com without one.

Be sure to ask your parents for permission before you send any information about yourself over the Internet, such as: your name, address, phone number, or email address, to us or to anyone else.

**Parents**  
We are committed to protecting your children's privacy. If PETCO.com knowingly collects personally identifying data from children, we will use it for internal purposes only. We will not post it, publish it, or supply it to any third parties. As mentioned earlier, for certain purposes we may use anonymous, aggregated data about our users. Kids' information may be included in this aggregated data, but will not be personally identifiable. Children must ask their parents or guardians for permission before visiting PETCO.com or purchasing anything from PETCO.com. It is also recommended that children get permission before sharing personal information (such as name, address, phone number, or email address) over the Internet.
