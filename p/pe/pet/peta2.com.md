# peta2 Privacy Policy | About peta2 | peta2.com

We at peta2 strongly believe in protecting the privacy of any personal information gathered from our Street Teamers and visitors to peta2.com.

**_Note:_  If you’re under 18, please make sure that your parent or guardian has read and agreed to these terms before you use this site. ‘Cause we don’t want to get yelled at. That would suck.**

We perform statistical analyses of aggregate user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of various areas on our Web sites and to use such information to improve our Web sites’ ability to serve you better.

**Does PETA use “cookies” on its websites?**

PETA uses “cookies” and pixels on some webpages. A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on a visitor’s hard drive but does not contain any personal information itself. Cookies enhance a visitor’s experience by preventing the visitor from having to log in or provide information each time he or she revisits a PETA webpage and by customizing content based on a visitor’s interests. Pixels, often used in connection with cookies, are small blocks of code on webpages that perform functions such as allowing another server to measure viewing statistics for a webpage. Visitors can configure their browsers to refuse cookies or to be alerted when a site is attempting to send a cookie, although some PETA e-commerce pages will not function properly without accepting cookies. PETA and third-party vendors, including Google and Facebook, use cookies and pixels to show website visitors ads based on a visitor’s prior visits to the website as well as first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to report how ad impressions, other uses of ad services and interactions with them correspond to visits to our web site. PETA also makes use of demographic information gathered via Google Analytics Demographics & Interests reports to gain a deeper understanding of the visitors to our website so that we can cater content to them accordingly while also tracking our success at reaching new populations of people. Visitors who want to opt out of Google’s use of cookies in these ways can do so by visiting the [Google advertising opt-out page](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). Other options for managing the use of third-party cookies and pixels are available at [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices). PETA also uses cookies to administer its websites, track visitor movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
