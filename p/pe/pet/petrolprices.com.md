## What is Personal Information?

Personal information is information you provide to us which personally identifies you including your name, address and e-mail address.

## Non Personal Information

Non personal information is collected and recorded about users when they use the site. This information is collected into groups so that it no longer reflects or represents any individual user and is used purely for statistical purposes.

## What is a Cookie?

PetrolPrices.com uses cookies to store and collect information about your usage of the PetrolPrices.com web site, and affiliate web sites. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive and that send the information stored in them back to our web server when PetrolPrices.com web pages are accessed.

Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information, but they do enable us to load your personal settings and preferences information. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but contain an option for you to turn off the cookie acceptance if you prefer. If you turn off your cookie acceptance, you may not be able to sign on to PetrolPrices.com or access our services.

Additional system information we may gather includes time, type of web browser being used, the operating system/platform, your IP address, the web site from which you link to PetrolPrices.com, and CPU speed. We also take note of whether and how you use the information and services that we provide by recording site traffic patterns, user click streams and by maintaining log files of users’ access to site files.

## What is an IP address?

  * Each Internet connection is identified by a unique address which is referred to as an IP address (Internet Protocol address).
  * An IP address is made up of four numbers, separated by dots, for example: 87.124.10.1. This address allows any web site visitor to be identified with the co-operation of the ISP in question. In practice an Internet service provider would not give out this information because they would be in breach of the Data Protection Act. But you should be aware that it is technically possible to connect an IP with a user with the help of a court order and the ISP in question.
  * Some internet service providers also publish the name of the company or individual who uses the connection which allows anyone to see who is using that IP from central registries held by R.I.P.E. and other Regional Internet Registries you can check if your IP address is listed using the whois service provided by all RIR’s.
