We value your trust -- so we have taken great care to inform you in this Policy what we do and do not do with information that you provide us in the course of using our website, purchasing our products or using our services.

We use our best efforts to maintain the personal information you give to us in a secure, safe and responsible manner within the PetSmart Family. Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, the personal information we collect will not be sold, rented or leased and will only be shared within the PetSmart Family, which consists of divisions, subsidiaries and affiliates of PetSmart, Inc. (such as PetSmart of Canada, State Line Tack stores and/or catalog, PetSmart.com, PetSmart pet catalogs and PETsHOTEL), as well as PetSmart Charities, and those service providers that are in PetSmart stores, such as the veterinary (Banfield, The Pet Hospital) and grooming services, and adoption agencies.

Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, federal law protects all of your credit card purchases. In the very unlikely event that your credit card is stolen over the Internet, your maximum liability is $50. If your credit card company holds you responsible for this amount, PetSmart.com will reimburse you up to $50.
