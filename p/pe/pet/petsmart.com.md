**Privacy Policy**

At PETsMART.com we are committed to protecting the privacy of you and your Pet. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices of the information you provide us through registering and shopping on our site.

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information.

Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site.

Our site's order form requires users to give us contact and billing information. We collect visitor's contact information (like name, address and address) and financial information (like credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders, information about our company, and promotional material from some of our partners to our customers. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary and shared with other companies who use the information in aggregate to gather broad demographic information. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial information that is collected is used to check the users' qualifications and bill the user for products and services.

Visitors may also choose to register without ordering or to sign up for our newsletter. The contact information gathered here is used to send special promotions and newsletters to our visitors. It is also used to pre-populate the order form for our visitors in order to make the purchasing process more convenient. This information is not shared with our partners or other companies. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.

We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like their e-mail address). We use contact data from our contests to send users information about our company. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. This information is not shared with our partners or other companies. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.
