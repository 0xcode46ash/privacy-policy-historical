# PetPlace.com - Corporate

At PetPlace.com, we are committed to protecting the privacy of the users of our site and the security of the information they provide us.

The only personal information that PetPlace.com will obtain about our users is information voluntarily submitted by the users themselves. Statistical information about our users as a group may be provided to certain partners of PetPlace.com, but such aggregate information will present no identifiable information about individual users. PetPlace.com will not disclose identifiable personal information to any third party without prior permission from the user.

PetPlace.com may sometimes request personal identification information from users in connection with services offered on our site and contests, forums, bulletin boards, or other similar promotions we provide. We will explicitly identify what personal information is required to provide the service or promotion and how that information will be used. Such information will not be disclosed to any third party without prior permission granted by the user.

PetPlace.com is a password protected site, and we have taken great care to protect against the loss and misuse of information within our control. We employ a secure database and send personal information only via an encrypted transmission channel.

PetPlace.com may provide various links to third-party Web sites. Although these links provide greater services and resources to visitors to our site, we exert no authority over these linked sites. When users access a link from the PetPlace.com site to a third party site, they exit PetPlace.com and enter a third party’s site. PetPlace.com may have no control over the privacy standards of such third party sites and assumes no responsibility or liability for the independent privacy and data collection policies of linked sites. PetPlace.com recommends you review the policies of third-party sites before providing personal information.

Our site employs “cookie” technology to collect non-personal identification information from our users. Cookies are used to help our site provide content tailored to a user’s specific interests. Such information is used in the aggregate to understand how visitors make use of our site and the services and other resources we provide. While most browsers are set to receive cookies, an individual user can alter his or her browser setting to refuse cookies or provide an alert when cookies are being sent.

PetPlace.com provides users the opportunity when providing personal information to “opt-in” to receive marketing and/or promotional materials from our site or from our partners. We also will provide users the opportunity to change their “opt-in” status at any time they wish to stop receiving communications.

In such cases where children may be asked for personal information, PetPlace.com will notify the child user that parental permission should be obtained before providing such information.

Any of your individual information we have within our database will be available to you upon your request. PetPlace.com will correct any errors to your personal information upon your request.

Your acceptance of PetPlace.com’s Privacy Policy is signified by your use of our Web site. Your continued use of PetPlace.com following the posting of changes to these terms will mean that you accept those changes. Please discontinue the use of our site if you do not agree with our policy.
