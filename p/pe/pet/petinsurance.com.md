National Casualty Company (NCC) values you as a customer and respects your right to privacy. We recognize that you purchase our products and services because you trust that we will stand behind our promises. In turn, we pledge our commitment to treating your information responsibly. The companies listed below have established the following policies to assure you that we are committed to protecting your privacy. 

**How do we protect the confidentiality and security of your information?**  
We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to ensure your personal information is treated responsibly and in accordance with our privacy policy. We also restrict access to your personal information within our organization to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you, or to conduct NCC business. Employees who have access to customer information are educated to use it only for legitimate business purposes. Third party business partners who have access to personal information are legally bound not to disclose it or reuse it in any way. Additionally, we safeguard customer information in accordance with applicable data security regulations. 

**What personal information do we collect about you?**  
We collect personal information about you from the following sources: 

  * Information we receive from you on applications and other forms;  

  * Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others; and  

  * Depending upon the product or services you are requesting, information we receive from consumer reporting agencies, medical providers, or others.  


  
**What categories of information do we disclose and to whom?**  
We do not sell your personal information to anyone. We may disclose the following information to entities that perform marketing and administrative services on our behalf or as required or permitted by law for legal, regulatory or other purposes:

  * Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others, such as your account balance, policy coverage, payment history, the premium you pay, the shares you purchase, preferences, claims information, and the method of your purchase.  

  * If required for the products you select, information we receive from consumer reporting agencies and other sources, such as your creditworthiness, motor vehicle and driver data, medical and employment information, loss history reports, and additional driver data.   


  
Because we do not sell your personal information or share it, except for the reasons described in the examples above, there is no need for an opt-out process in the NCC privacy system. 

**Is your medical information confidential?**  
While we sometimes must collect medical information to provide you a product or to pay a claim, we do not use or share it, internally or externally, for any purpose except the following: 

  * underwriting insurance;  

  * administering your policy, account, or claim;  

  * as required or permitted by law; or  

  * as otherwise authorized by you.  


  
**Questions?**  
We value our customers and want you to understand how we use the information we collect. Please contact us if you have any questions about our privacy policy. 

  * We will provide you access to your personal information that we control and can reasonably retrieve. In accordance with our procedures, you must provide the following:  



  1. All policy numbers for which you want information.  

  2. Please sign your request and have your signature notarized to ensure the identity of the person requesting the information.  

  3. Although we do not currently intend to charge a fee to cover the cost in providing you with a copy of this information, we do reserve the right to implement a reasonable fee in the future.  

  4. You may request that we correct your personal information in our files. Please note that NCC does not control information given to us by third parties; you will need to contact the third party to correct any information it gave us.
