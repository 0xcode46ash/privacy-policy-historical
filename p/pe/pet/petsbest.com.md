###  HOW WE PROTECT AND USE CUSTOMER INFORMATION

We safeguard the security and integrity of customer information. We are committed to protecting the security and integrity of customer information through procedures and technology designed for this purpose. For example: We limit employee access to customer information to those who have a business reason to know this information. Employees are required to honor our code of conduct, which includes standards to protect customer confidentiality. They are subject to disciplinary action if they fail to do so. We maintain policies and procedures covering the proper physical security of workplaces and records. Our physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards meet or exceed federal standards regarding the protection of customer information. We require independent contractors and outside companies who work with us to adhere to strict privacy standards through their contracts with us. 

We use technological means (such as backup files, virus detection and eradication software, firewalls, and other computer software and hardware) to protect against unauthorized access or alterations to customer data.

For each visitor to our Web site ("User"), our Web server will automatically recognize the User's domain name, but not the User's e-mail address. Pets Best collects and stores the domain name, the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, the aggregate information on the Web pages that Users access or visit, and any and all information volunteered by the User, such as survey information and/or information we seek for site registration or security purposes including information entered by the User for policy applications including financial information. We will keep financial information (such as credit card and bank account information) in our files for future billing of policy premiums as agreed to by the User when applying for policies. The User information collected by Pets Best will not be shared with organizations which are not affiliated with Pets Best unless otherwise noted below. 

Users who supply us with their postal address, e-mail address or telephone numbers on-line can expect Pets Best to share that information with Pets Best's affiliates, its agents or brokers. As such, these Users may receive periodic mailings from Pets Best, its affiliates, its agents or brokers with information regarding new products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please indicate this choice in your on-line communication and Pets Best will remove your name from the list it shares with its affiliates, its agents or brokers. 

Pets Best places Internet cookies on our Users' hard drives. A cookie is a small file that is sent from Pets Best's Web server to a Users' personal computer.
