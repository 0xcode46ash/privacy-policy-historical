###  HOW WE PROTECT AND USE CUSTOMER INFORMATION

We safeguard the security and integrity of customer information. We are committed to protecting the security and integrity of customer information through procedures and technology designed for this purpose. For example: We limit employee access to customer information to those who have a business reason to know this information. Employees are required to honor our code of conduct, which includes standards to protect customer confidentiality. They are subject to disciplinary action if they fail to do so. We maintain policies and procedures covering the proper physical security of workplaces and records. Our physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards meet or exceed federal standards regarding the protection of customer information. We require independent contractors and outside companies who work with us to adhere to strict privacy standards through their contracts with us. 

We use technological means (such as backup files, virus detection and eradication software, firewalls, and other computer software and hardware) to protect against unauthorized access or alterations to customer data.

For each visitor to our Web site ("User"), our Web server will automatically recognize the User's domain name, but not the User's e-mail address. General Fire collects and stores the domain name, the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, the aggregate information on the Web pages that Users access or visit, and any and all information volunteered by the User, such as survey information and/or information we seek for site registration or security purposes including information entered by the User for policy applications including financial information. We will keep financial information (such as credit card and bank account information) in our files for future billing of policy premiums as agreed to by the User when applying for policies. The User information collected by General Fire will not be shared with organizations which are not affiliated with General Fire unless otherwise noted below. 

Users who supply us with their postal address, e-mail address or telephone numbers on-line can expect General Fire to share that information with General Fire's affiliates, its agents or brokers. As such, these Users may receive periodic mailings from General Fire, its affiliates, its agents or brokers with information regarding new products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please indicate this choice in your on-line communication and General Fire will remove your name from the list it shares with its affiliates, its agents or brokers. 

General Fire places Internet cookies on our Users' hard drives. A cookie is a small file that is sent from General Fire's Web server to a Users' personal computer. This file contains information about a User's visit to General Fire's Web site that only General Fire's server can read. The cookies are stored on the User's hard drive and are not stored, in any form, by General Fire. General Fire uses only session cookies and not persistent cookies.

The information you provide to us online is protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL technology). SSL is the leading security protocol for data transfer on the Internet. This technology scrambles your account information as it moves between your PC's browser and General Fire's computer systems. When information is scrambled, or encrypted in this way, it becomes nearly impossible for anyone other than General Fire to read it. This secure session helps protect the safety and confidentiality of your information. From our web sites, we do not knowingly collect or use personal information from children under 13 without containing verifiable consent from their parents. Should a child whom we know to be under 13 send personal information to us, we will only use that information to respond directly to that child, seek parental consent, or provide parental notice. We are not responsible for the data collection and use practices of nonaffiliated third parties to which our web sites may link.
