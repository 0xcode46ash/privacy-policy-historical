# Privacy Policy - Pepper Computer

## Privacy Policy 

As used in this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means personally identifiable information such as your name, street address, telephone number, credit card information and instant messaging screen names and passwords and email address.

### How we use your Information

When you place an order for products online from the Pepper Computer Internet store, we collect information associated with the transaction. This information includes your name, mailing address, products ordered, and credit card information. We ask for this information so that we may fulfill the order. The information is stored in a customer file in a secure environment.

When you place an online order, we will send a confirming e-mail message. In the future, we may also send an occasional e-mail featuring a special promotion or product that may be of interest to our customers. Any customer who prefers not to receive an online order confirmation may "opt-out" by so indicating this preference on the order form. If you do receive an e-mail from us that you would rather not receive, simply follow the "opt-out" instructions included in the e-mail.

We use cookies to better tailor our site and our products to your interests and needs.

The use of cookies is an industry standard and you will find them at most Web sites. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies.

### Privacy of Children

Pepper Computer is committed to protecting the online privacy of children and making the Internet safe for our users. For this reason, Pepper Computer does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we receive personal information that we discover was provided by a child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete this information. We encourage parents of children under 13 to regularly check and monitor their children's use of e-mail and other activities on-line.
