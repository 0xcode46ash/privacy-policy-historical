  * **Information you provide**. We may collect, sell, or share any personal information you enter on our web site or provide to us in some other manner, including through e-mail marketing by us, and our partners and affiliates. We only share with our partners and affiliates when you affirmatively choose to participate in our special offers. Please see below under “How you can access your information” about how to opt-out of any sharing. This includes identifying information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number, and, if you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information) (Please see "How we protect your personal information", below). 
  * **Searching for people** When you are searching for people, you may enter third party personal information such as their name, address, phone, email or social security number. We only use the data you input to provide you with a request and do not use it for any other purpose. 
  * **Tell-A-Friend**. If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and for tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at <http://www.peoplefinders.com/contact-us.aspx> to request that we remove this information from our database.

Personal information. We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated below or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared. We may share personal information with:

  * **Authorized service providers** : We may share your personal information with our authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include sending direct and electronic mail, removing duplicate information from user lists, analyzing data, providing marketing analysis, and supporting our web site functionality. These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes. 
  * **Business partners** : We may collect, sell, or share any personal information you enter on our web site or provide to us in some other manner with your consent, including via e-mail marketing. We may work with other businesses to bring select retail opportunities to our users via e-mail marketing campaigns by us, or our partner web sites/co-brands, or our marketing partners, including affiliated third party advertisers. We will not share your personal information for third party marketing purposes with these third parties without your consent. The other businesses we work with may include: (a) providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation; (b) e-mail marketers; and (c) telemarketers. When you open, preview or click on the advertising portion of our e-mails and/or those of our marketing partners and/or affiliates, you have agreed to the terms set forth in our Privacy Policy, and agree that as a function of opening, previewing or clicking on the advertising portion of our e-mails, you will receive new or additional marketing communications from us. These e-mail campaigns may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with the e-mail marketing material. There are a number of places on our web site and in e-mail campaigns where you may click on a link to access other web sites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. These third-party web sites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information from you, and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those web sites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party web sites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the web page you are visiting.
  * **Direct mail partners**. With your consent, we will share our e-mail/postal mailing list with selected providers of goods and services that may be of interest to you.
  * **E-mail lists.** Users may remove themselves from a specific mailing list by utilizing the unsubscribe options that are present at the end of each e-mail we send on behalf of the list owner. Unsubscribing from one list will not automatically unsubscribe a user from all lists.
  * **Other Situations**. We also may disclose your information: 
    * In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us. 
    * When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our web site terms and conditions or other agreements or policies. 
    * In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. The personal information which you provide to us is an asset of the company and may be included in the assets transferred in the event of a substantial corporate transaction. 
    * When we deem it necessary or appropriate including, without limitation, sharing your e-mail address with other third-parties for suppression purposes in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time to time, the Federal Trade Commission’s enabling regulations, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. §1681 _et seq_.).



Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and disclose personal information. Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the web sites of those third parties. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.

Aggregated and non-personal information. We reserve the right to provide aggregate or group data about PeopleFinders.com users for lawful purposes. Aggregate or group data is data that describes the demographics, usage, or characteristics of PeopleFinders.com participants as a group, without disclosing personally identifiable information. By opening a PeopleFinders.com account, you agree to allow PeopleFinders.com to provide such aggregate data to third parties. By agreeing to these terms, you hereby consent to the disclosure of any record or communication to any third party when PeopleFinders.com, in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate. 

If you use a blog or post your story testimonial on this Web site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. All users who have posted testimonials on the site have given their permission to post their personal information on the site and are able to have their information removed by [contacting us via email](http://www.peoplefinders.com/contact-us.aspx). 

**4\. Links to Other Sites**

This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.

We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.

This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.

**5\. Third-party reports**

The information contained in our reports comes from proprietary sources and third party suppliers, and is beyond our control to edit, modify, or change. You acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such information.

**6\. How you can access your information**

If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by logging into your account <http://www.peoplefinders.com/reports/>. You can also review and update your personal information by contacting us. More information about how to contact us is provided below.

You can opt-out of having your information shared with third parties when you first signup. You can also update your preferences accessing “My Account” and updating your settings, or by [contacting us via email](http://www.peoplefinders.com/contact-us.aspx).

**7\. Your choices about collection and use of your information**

You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our web site because such information may be required in order for you to have personalized recommendations presented to you; register as a user; purchase products or services; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our web site. 

At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional e-mails or newsletters from us by unsubscribing. In every marketing e-mail communication we send, there is an unsubscribe hyperlink that allows the recipient to unsubscribe from that specific marketing program by simply clicking the hyperlink provided and following the instructions provided. We attempt to process all such unsubscribe requests in a prompt fashion. You can also unsubscribe by logging into “My Account”, “Email Preferences” and Opting out of receiving promotional emails. However, after unsubscribing, we cannot guarantee that you will never receive another marketing mailing from us, because we may obtain your e-mail address in the future through a different e-mail marketing program that you have opted into. We can guarantee, however, that if you should ever receive another e-mail marketing communication from us, you will be able to remove your e-mail address via the unsubscribe hyperlink. Unsubscribing from one marketing list will not automatically unsubscribe a user from all marketing lists. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as service announcements and administrative notices, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.

**8\. How we protect your personal information**

We take industry appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. When users submit information at our web site, their information is protected both online and offline. The privacy of your personal information is very important to us and access to your information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public. The servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure physical environment. We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of personal information under our control. Currently, we use Secure Socket Layer Software ("SSL") to protect data and to secure any transactions. SSL encrypts information, including credit card numbers, names and addresses as they are transmitted over the Internet. Please be advised that, although we take every reasonable technological precaution available to protect your data, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot warrant that your information will be absolutely secure and any transmission of data at or through our web site is at your own risk. 

Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's web site at <http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.

To the extent that user credit card-specific information (or alternate user payment method information, such as PayPay, Google Check-Out, etc.) is collected by us and/or any of our partners and affiliates, this information will be kept in confidence and will not be shared with any third parties (other than consumer credit agencies) without the user's prior informed consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PeopleFinders.com, our partners, affiliates and/or subsidiaries reserve the right to share with third parties the fact that we have credit card information on file for specific users but we will not share the specific credit card information with third parties without the user's prior informed consent.

**10\. Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. **We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, and/or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
