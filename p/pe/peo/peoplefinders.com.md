### Commonly Asked Questions

What's the difference between public records, publicly available information, and non-public information? These terms refer to the source of the information. The following definitions have been agreed by various information industry and government groups:

Public Records are compiled by various public offices and agencies with the intent and for the purpose of being made publicly available. Examples of public records include real estate records, lien filings, business entity filings (such as corporate registrations), lawsuit information and court dockets, court decisions, and birth, marriage, divorce and death records.

Publicly Available Information generally originates with the individual himself or herself and is provided in the course of routine business transactions such as ordering telephone service, placing catalog orders, making retail purchases, and joining book clubs. Published telephone numbers, household demographics, street addresses, and church and school alumni directory information all fall within the category of publicly available information. Information contained in newspapers and magazines (such as news reports and birth, death and marriage notices) is also considered to be publicly available.

Private or Non-Public Information is not generally available from public records or commercial sources. Non-public information includes information that is protected from disclosure by law or by custom, such as medical records, employment records, tax returns, and personal financial records.

### Can I Opt Out Of Public Records Databases?

No. Public records, by law, must be available from the official public records office to anyone who requests them. Accordingly, because individuals cannot opt out of public records databases generally, Enformion People Finders!™ does not offer individuals the opportunity to opt out of our public records databases. In order for any database of public records to be useful, the databases must contain all of the information in the public records offices. Our data files must accurately reflect the underlying public records, and we do not remove or suppress any information that is both accurate and publicly available.

If you have a compelling privacy or security issue, you may wish to contact the official custodians of those public records that contain questionable information about you, such as your county recorder or county assesor's office, to determine the proper proceedure for removing or updating your information which is public record. (The process of having public records sealed typically requires a court order.) This process will ensure that the information is not available from the public records custodian, Enformion People Finders!™, or any other information provider.

The information contained in any Enformion People Finders!™ report may contain inaccuracies for which Enformion People Finders!™ cannot be responsible. The information is provided 'AS IS'. Please see the terms of the User Agreement for any applicable limitations of liability that apply. The information contained in this site is for reference purposes only and can only be verified at the original source.

### Enformion Background Check™

An Enformion Background Check scans over 2 billion records to create a comprehensive report on virtually any individual contained in our database. Enformion Background Checks and Enformion Locate Reports are not included in the price of a paid membership and are billed on a per report basis. You will always receive a confirmation before the system runs an Enformion Background Check.

### Refund Policy

Enformion People Finders!™ wants you to feel secure with your purchase and will guarantee your satisfaction. If you are not completely satisfied with your purchase, please contact customer support and we will refund your money. The amount of a refund is limited to the actual fees paid.
