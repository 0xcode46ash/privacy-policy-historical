# PeoplePC | Your Privacy Matters

## Our Privacy Policy

**_Your Privacy Matters to PeoplePC!_**  
At PeoplePC, we know how important privacy is.* We want to protect your individual privacy, while giving you the most benefit from your PeoplePC membership. 

**_As a PeoplePC Member..._**   
When you become a member of PeoplePC, you request an array of valuable services from us. In order to provide you with those services, we need to learn more about you. 

By joining PeoplePC, you add one more person's worth of clout to our growing community of savvy, forward-looking members. (Thanks!) Banded together, PeoplePC members command the same marketplace power that large corporations, bulk buyer's clubs and special-interest groups enjoy. 

In order to give members a complete membership package - a new computer and unlimited Net access with email and more - we've carefully chosen a few partner companies we believe in and brought their services together. To seamlessly offer you these core companies' services and products, we must pass on selected member contact information to them, so that they can create an account for you within their systems. For example, you will need to provide financial information to us to qualify for the financing of the PeoplePC computer system - and we'll pass this information on to our financing partner. But we will never share that information with any other partners (or anyone else) without your express consent. 

Our core partners include: our financial partners who provide financing for our PCs (and need credit information), our telecommunications and email partners who work with us to establish and manage member accounts, and our PC manufacturer and warranty service partners who require product registration information to fulfill warranty obligations.

Once you're a member, you will enjoy special deals through our merchant partners. As a tool to leverage great shopping values for you, we collect information about PeoplePC members as a group and share this information with our partners. We only share anonymous descriptions of the PeoplePC membership as a whole. But except when you give your express consent, or when we are providing services you have requested, we'll never give or sell merchants information about you as an individual (who you are, what you like or how to get in touch with you). The only person who can decide what merchant partners know about you individually is you. 

**_Visiting PeoplePC Web sites..._**  
When you visit PeoplePC's Web sites, we may collect information about you that does not identify you as an individual. For example, we might track which Web sites you visit and save this information in the form of a "cookie" or similar file. Cookies are stored on your computer hard drive, not on our site, but allow us to follow the paths of users across our sites. Cookies just track your Web activity - they cannot find out your name or phone number. They do not spy on you, and they cannot breach your hard drive and steal information. Cookies can help us provide you with information targeted to your interests, and they allow us to better understand how you like to use our site. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our sites may not work optimally in that case. 

From time to time, we'll share aggregated (collective) information about our visitors or membership as a group, or generate aggregate reports and market research. These reports will not identify individual members. 

We won't collect any personally identifying information about you on our sites (such as your name, mailing address, or telephone number) unless you voluntarily submit it to us. For example, you might choose to register your email address with us so we can notify you of future offerings. We won't share this data with anyone without your express consent. 

**_Our ongoing commitment to your privacy_**  
Whether you're a member or just a visitor to the site... 

We'll use industry-standard methods to protect your information from unauthorized access. Among other techniques, we store such information on a computer behind our "firewall" in a secure location, and we restrict the number of employees internally who can access such data. Please be aware, of course, that there is no such thing as perfect security - on or off the Internet. 

We may give you the chance to opt in to merchant mailing lists or preregister on their sites for faster shopping. These are options that you may take or leave at your discretion. 

Keep this in mind about sites that you reach through links from our services, sites we cobrand with, or our partners: Each separate company has its own privacy policies and practices and may market to you accordingly. Please link with caution and pay attention to the policies and practices of the businesses you patronize. 

When you give us your information, we will offer you a reasonable way, when possible, to review your information and either change or remove such data. If such information is also stored in other databases, we cannot always ensure that corrections or deletions will reach the other databases. 

If you wish to have information you provided to us online removed from our records, please contact us at the email address below. We'll use all reasonable efforts to ensure that your information is removed from our records. 

We request that people under 18 do not give us any personally identifiable information, such as name, address, or telephone number. 

If you have concerns or questions about your privacy as a PeoplePC member or on PeoplePC's sites, or you would like to change your information, please contact us via email at [feedback@peoplepc.com](mailto:feedback@peoplepc.com) or via U.S. mail at PeoplePC, 100 Pine Street - Suite 1100, San Francisco, CA 94111. 

Any amendments to this policy will be posted on this Web page, and will take effect when posted.
