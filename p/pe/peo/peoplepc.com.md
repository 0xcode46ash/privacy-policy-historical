# PeoplePC: Privacy and Other Policies — Privacy Policy

**Your Privacy Matters to PeoplePC!**

PeoplePC wants to protect your privacy, while giving you the most benefit from your PeoplePC Membership. We've described below our policies concerning collection, use, and protection of personal information we acquire online ("Personal Data"). This policy covers Personal Data gathered through these Web sites: PeoplePC <[http://www.peoplepc.com](http://www.peoplepc.com/)> and PeoplePC Member Site <[http://home.peoplepc.com](http://home.peoplepc.com/)> (the "PeoplePC Sites").

Our site contains links to sites operated by third parties. Each company has its own privacy policies and practices, and PeoplePC is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of third party web sites. Please read these third party policies and use your own judgment when visiting these sites.

We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting a revised policy. Any changes we make will be effective from the date shown as the Effective Date. However, so that our policy applies uniformly to all Members, the Privacy Policy as modified will apply to Personal Data without regard to whether it was collected before or after such Effective Date.

**Types of Personal Data You May Provide PeoplePC:**

**Personal registration information.** When you register as a PeoplePC Member, you will provide to us contact information (e.g., your name, billing and shipping addresses, and email address) and billing information (e.g., a credit card number). In addition, when you register as a Member, you will choose a password. You may also be asked to provide personal information when registering for other online services provided by PeoplePC.

PeoplePC and its partners (see below) may use your contact information to ship your purchases to you and to provide Membership services to you. 

We may use your contact information to send various communications to you via email or snail mail. These communications may relate to PeoplePC or to products and/or services offered by our merchant partners. You may opt-out of receiving these communications -- see the choice/opt-out section below. 

If you have become a Member through a program sponsored by your employer or an entity with which you are affiliated (such as a club or association to which you belong), we may give your name and email address to such employer or affiliated entity so that it may communicate with you. We will not share with your employer or affiliated entity any other information about you or your activities on the Internet.

**Information you decide to publish on the Internet.** You may supply additional information about yourself in your online activities. For instance, you may publish your own web page, provide information about yourself through our PeoplePages feature, or participate in on-line chat rooms. You have decided to make this information publicly available on the Internet. Information you voluntarily publish is not subject to this privacy policy.

**Responses to promotional events and contests.** From time to time PeoplePC or its partners may conduct contests or other promotional events. As a condition of participating in these events, Members may be asked to provide personal information. You will be notified of the use to be made of such information at the time the information is requested, and you will have the opportunity to decline to participate. Information you provide through promotional events will be used as disclosed in the event solicitation materials. 

**Responses to surveys.** From time to time, we may conduct online surveys. Our online surveys may ask for information such as profile data or member experience opinions. Depending on the nature of the survey, we may disclose survey results to third parties on an aggregate basis without restriction. We may also use this data to personalize our site so that you see content in which we think you might be interested. 

**Communications with us.** You may contact us from time to time regarding matters related to your Membership and the services we provide. If you contact us by phone, email, or snail mail, we may keep a record of our communications with you, and use the information you provide so that we can respond to your inquiry. 

**Information Automatically Logged:**

**IP address.** We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our Web sites, and to help identify you. We may use this information for such things as helping us to track the success of new features.

**Use of cookies.** Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart, to deliver content specific to your interests, and to allow us to better understand how you like to use our site. For example, we might track which of our site pages you visit and save this information in the form of a "cookie" or similar file. We also use cookies to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. Cookies are stored on your computer hard drive, not on our site. Cookies do not spy on you, and they cannot be used to breach the security of your hard drive and steal information. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our sites may not work optimally in that case.

**Your use of the PeoplePC Sites.** In order to provide better service to you, PeoplePC monitors usage of the PeoplePC Sites. For instance, we may track hits to each of the pages in our site. PeoplePC also collects data on transactions you engage in at PeopleShop, PeoplePC's online store. PeoplePC does not collect any information about your activities on the Internet after you leave the PeoplePC Sites. We use data about your usage of the PeoplePC Sites in order to improve our service to you. If we share such information with others, we will do so only on an aggregate basis that does not identify you as an individual.

**Information Related to PeoplePC's Special Features:**

**PeoplePC Online Wallet.** If you make use of the PeoplePC Online Wallet, you will be providing to us personal identification information and other data such as credit card numbers. This information is used when you engage in transactions with merchants to help you fill out on-line forms automatically. We will not use this information for any other purpose, or share the information with any third party. For purposes of improving out service, we keep track of the aggregate number of forms that are filled out, and if there is any problem with auto-filling a form, we record the web address (URL) of the page so that we can address the issue. 

The information you store in your PeoplePC Online Wallet is protected with the same level of security generally associated with the "lock" icon that appears in Internet Explorer when visiting a secure site. Because the Wallet is displayed in an Explorer Bar window in Internet Explorer, the lock icon may not appear when viewing a non-secure web page, even though the Wallet Explorer bar is operating in secure mode. 

While we are confident both in the level of security that 128-bit SSL offers and in the design of our systems, due to the public nature of a network like the Internet, there are always potential security risks. 

If you have concerns about storing your credit card information online, you can use the rest of the wallet and simply leave the credit card fields blank. This will allow you to take advantage of the timesaving features of the online wallet while eliminating your exposure to credit card fraud. When you instruct us to do so, we will disclose information you have submitted in connection with the PeoplePC Online Wallet to the merchant with whom you are transacting business.

**PeoplePC Deal Finder.** The PeoplePC Deals Finder alerts members when they are browsing a site maintained by a third party merchant that offers a special deal to PeoplePC members. The feature does this by comparing the current web address (URL) being viewed against a table of known URLs. It does not associate individual information, such as your membername, with the URLs being viewed. 

PeoplePC does not collect or record URLs or other data regarding your activities at sites other than the PeoplePC Sites. PeoplePC only monitors the URLs you visit so that we can bring your attention to deals offered to PeoplePC Members by merchants whose sites you are visiting. PeoplePC will not share the URLs being viewed with any third parties. 

**PeoplePages.** PeoplePages is a feature that allows you to create a special page on which you can voluntarily post personal information about yourself. Your PeoplePage will be available to anyone surfing the PeoplePages site, including non-PeoplePC members. By posting personal information on your PeoplePage, you are assuming the risk that persons accessing the PeoplePages site may use or misuse such information. PeoplePC will not be responsible or liable for such use or misuse. In addition, PeoplePC may feature your personal PeoplePage (as one of our "Featured Pages" or otherwise) on the PeoplePages site. Information you provide on your PeoplePage may also be used to offer you an improved, more personalized PeoplePC experience. 

**Information Exchanged with Our Vendors:**

PeoplePC frequently uses third party vendors to help us to provide services to Members. To allow these vendors to create an account for you within their systems and to provide services to you, we must pass on information about you to them. Our third party vendors have agreed to use your personal information only to perform their functions as PeoplePC vendor-partners. Our core partners include: 

• | financial vendors who provide financing for purchase of Membership packages;  
---|---  
• | telecommunications and email vendors who work with us to establish and manage Member accounts;  
• | PC manufacturers and warranty service vendors who require product registration information to fulfill warranty obligations;  
• | shipping vendors who work with us to deliver to you the PeoplePC products that you request; and  
• | the merchandising vendor who helps us to offer PeopleShop, the online product and computer accessory store. Our merchandising vendor may contact you directly concerning special offers they extend from time to time to PeoplePC Members. You may opt-out of receiving these communications -- see the choice/opt-out section below.  



**Information Exchanged with Merchant Partners:**

Once you're a Member, you will enjoy special deals through our merchants who wish to make special offers to PeoplePC Members. We share with merchant partners aggregate information about the PeoplePC Membership. 

We may also from time to time make your contact information available so that merchants may tell you directly about offers that you might find of interest. When we do so, we will typically use a third party fulfillment house that has agreed to keep the contact information confidential and to use the information only for the purpose of conducting the mailings in question. We will not give your contact information directly to merchants, nor make the information available to any third party for unrestricted use. You may opt-out of receiving these communications -- see the choice/opt-out section below.

**Additional Information:**

**Security.**  
Our sites have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We use commercial industry-standard methods to protect your information from unauthorized access. Among other techniques, we store such information on a computer behind our "firewall" in a secure location. Of course, there is no such thing as perfect security, and whatever the level of security, it is always possible that security breaches could occur. PeoplePC is not responsible for damages caused by the intentional wrongful actions of others that result in a breach of security.

**Choice/Opt-Out.**  
You may opt-out of receiving email newsletters from PeoplePC by following the specific "unsubscribe" instructions included in the email. To elect not to receive any other emails and /or promotional information from PeoplePC or its merchant vendors or partners, [click here](http://home.peoplepc.com/help/helpinfo/preferences.asp) to update your preferences.

If you want to reduce the amount of national advertising mail you receive at home, send your name and address to the Direct Marketing Association's Mail Preference Service (MPS): Mail Preference Service, Direct Marketing Association, P.O. Box 9008, Farmingdale, NY 11735-9008.

**Special circumstances.**  
PeoplePC may be required by law enforcement agencies or judicial authorities to provide personal data on individual users. In matters involving a danger to personal or public safety, PeoplePC may voluntarily share personal data with appropriate governmental authorities. In circumstances involving a breach of PeoplePC's Acceptable Use Policy, PeoplePC may share personal data with governmental authorities and with the companies that provide Internet connectivity to PeoplePC. PeoplePC may also disclose personal data where necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating PeoplePC's Acceptable Use Policy or other user policies, to operate PeoplePC's services properly, or to protect PeoplePC or its members.

**Changing/Removing information.**  
If you wish to have information you have provided to us removed from our records or changed please contact us at one of the addresses listed below, and we will use all reasonable efforts to accommodate your request.

**Contacting us.**  
Please contact us if you have any questions or concerns about your privacy as a PeoplePC member or on PeoplePC's sites. You can reach PeoplePC via email at member.services@peoplepc.com  or via mail at:
