Any personally identifying information collected by this site from children is used for editorial participation and feedback purposes, together with any other purposes that will be described where the information is collected, and will not be transferred to any third party. Many of the web sites maintained by Time Inc., including this one, place a "cookie" in the browser files of the user's computer.
