Peopleclick is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.  TRUSTe is an independent, organization whose mission is to build user’s trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices.  This Privacy Policy covers the Web site [www.peopleclick.com](http://www.peopleclick.com/).  Because Peopleclick wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.

Upon request and within 30 days, Peopleclick will grant individuals reasonable access to personal information that it holds about them.

**_Security_**  
Peopleclick takes technical, contractual, administrative and physical steps to protect against unauthorized access to and disclosure of individually identifiable information. If, during their employment, Peopleclick employees acquire confidential or proprietary information belonging to Peopleclick or its clients, such information will be handled in confidence and may not be disclosed to unauthorized third parties. Peopleclick employees are also responsible for the internal security of such information.  Peopleclick provides information and training to all employees who have access to data maintained on behalf of Peopleclick customers. Employees who violate Peopleclick's security and safe maintenance of data policies are subject to discipline including termination.  To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of Personal Information, Peopleclick has adopted appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the Personal Information we process.  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.  Peopleclick does not share, sell, rent, or trade PII with third parties for their promotional purposes.  If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can email us at [Security@peopleclick.com](mailto:Security@peopleclick.com).
