**Security**

To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of personal information, Peoplefluent has adopted appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the personal information we process. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Data maintained by Peoplefluent is protected by computer security mechanisms including firewalls, encryption, monitoring software, data and network segmentation, and passwords. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number and your login information) on our order forms or application sites, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If, during their employment, Peoplefluent employees acquire confidential or proprietary information belonging to Peoplefluent or its customers, such information is required to be handled in confidence and may not be disclosed to unauthorized third parties. Peoplefluent employees are also responsible for the internal security of such information. Peoplefluent provides information and training to all employees who have access to data maintained on behalf of Peoplefluent customers. Employees who violate Peoplefluent security and safe maintenance of data policies are subject to appropriate discipline including, but not limited to, termination. If you have any questions about our security practices, you can email us at [Security@peoplefluent.com](mailto:Security@peoplefluent.com).
