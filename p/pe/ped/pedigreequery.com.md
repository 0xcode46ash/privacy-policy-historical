**The Way We Use Information:**

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

We will call you back at the number provided to discuss your request. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. 

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error. 

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
