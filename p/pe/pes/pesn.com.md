Participants will be informed when the list is to be made public and have the option to request that Pure Energy Systems remove any information they do not want made public.

**PUBLIC Lists**

Pure Energy Systems sets up and moderates public lists using Yahoo Groups. Information disclosed on public lists is considered public information and may appear on the website as well as in the list archives. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these areas.

This Privacy Policy may change over time. Data collected can and will be used in accordance with the posted Privacy Policy at the time of collection. Changes to this policy are not retroactive.
