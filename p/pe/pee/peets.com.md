# Peet's Coffee & Tea

**General Principles**  
Peet's adheres to industry best privacy principles with respect to the data collection practices on this Web site. Our fundamental privacy principles incorporate the guidelines set forth by the Federal Trade Commission for Web sites that collect personally identifying information: 

**Notice**  
Peet's is committed to clearly and readily disclosing our data collection practices so that you can make informed decisions about your activities at our web site. 

**Choice.**  
Peet's provides you with a choice whether to participate in its data collection activities. 

**Access.**  
Peet's provides you with the opportunity to review, modify, and delete any personally identifiable information that you have previously provided. 

**Security**  
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Peets.com uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the industry standard for secure commerce transactions to transmit your credit card information over the Internet. This means your credit card number is scrambled during the transaction process, so that the information cannot be read as it travels over the Internet.

**IP Addresses**  
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information in the interest of improving our site and service. 


**Cookies and Web Beacons**  
A cookie is a unique identifier collected by the site to verify a return visitor's identity, or to understand how visitors navigate the site. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many major web sites use them. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies; however, you can usually change your browser to prevent or notify you whenever you are sent a cookie. This gives you the chance to decide whether or not to accept the cookie.

**A "cookie" does not tell us who you are, your email address, or any other personal information**. We use the information it provides to help us improve the site and our service, and to provide our visitors with a better experience, while on the site. 

You may adjust your browser's settings to reject our cookies, those of our business partners, or those of our service providers (described below). Please note that if you upgrade your browser or use another computer, you may have to make additional or further adjustments. Even without accepting our cookie you can still access most of the features on the site. There will, however, be limitations on your use of some site functions. For example, if you choose to disable cookies you will not be able to view your orders on-line, store or update your user profile, or take advantage of promotional discounts.

A Web Beacon (also called a "clear GIF", "image tag", or "pixel tag" is a small line of code that is placed on a website that facilitates analysis of the general usage patterns of visitors to the website and advertising campaigns. 

**Registration Forms and Email Addresses**  
Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and e-mail address), financial information (like their account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (like their zip code and state). We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about our company. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future e-mails; see the choice/opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data may also be collected at our site. We use this data to help us improve this website and our service. 

When you contact us via email, we answer by sending an email response to the sender. We also store the email we receive for archival purposes and for our own marketing purposes if we feel that it is consistent with the nature of the inquiry. We will not use return email addresses for any other purpose unless you give us permission to do so 

**Business Partners**  
This site contains links to other sites. Peet's Coffee & Tea is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

Information collected on this web site --such as sales data or general demographic information-- is available to certain business partners of Peet's Coffee & Tea. Each such business partner enters into a confidentiality agreement with Peet's Coffee & Tea. This insures that data we collect from our customers will not be sold, rented, or otherwise distributed to parties unknown to Peet's Coffee & Tea; nor used for purposes other then those expressly sanctioned by Peet's Coffee & Tea. We never share specific information such as name, address, or email address at any time.

**Our Service Providers**  
We use the services of several third parties in connection with our site (i.e., banner advertising services or email delivery). These service providers may use cookies and Web Beacons on our behalf and may set and read cookies using their own servers. Each of these service providers is contractually obligated to use these technologies only to provide services to us and in a manner consistent with this privacy statement. Moreover, these vendors may only use data that they may collect on our behalf (or that we otherwise provide to them) in connection with their provision of services to us. With certain service providers, we allow them to use data in an aggregated, anonymous manner to compile statistics about their services and to publish those statistics. For example, our banner advertising service provider can say that it "serves X billion impressions on behalf of our customers each month". 

We use the services of a third party site analytics vendor to assist us in better understanding your use of our site. This vendor uses cookies and Web Beacons on our behalf. The collection of data on our site by this vendor is accomplished through a first-party data collection mechanism, so merely blocking cookies served from third party domains will not block these first-party cookies. The information that this vendor collects and stores on our behalf allows us to better understand how our site's visitors use and respond to this site. This vendor analyzes the information it collects on our behalf and returns it to us via a secure web connection. The information and analysis will be used to assist us in better understanding your interests in our web site and how to better serve those interests and provide you with more personalized product offerings. Other than possibly allowing use of collected data on an aggregate basis, this vendor is contractually prohibited from using our data for any other purpose and is required to maintain all information collected and its analysis in confidence. As a visitor to this site, you have the option to deactivate the ability of this vendor to collect your data on our behalf. You may also choose to continue to benefit from the improved shopping experience which these services allow us to provide to you, but maintain anonymity. If you delete your cookies or visit this site using another browser, you will need to opt-out again.
