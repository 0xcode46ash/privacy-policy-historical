# Privacy - PeerIndex

## Privacy

Welcome to PeerIndex. We provide a service to help you understand how authoritative you are on the Web, and to help you find authorities and opinion formers on various topics. Providing this service requires collecting and sharing information about your interests and preferences, while shielding sensitive personal information from risks of misuse.

The below sets out our Privacy Policy:

**Information Collected.** PeerIndex collects the following types of information:

  1. Personal information provided by you (e.g. username, contact email).
  2. Third party information provided by you that is publically accessible (e.g. a public Twitter feed, your public profile on LinkedIn).
  3. Usage information (collected through cookies and log files).



**Use made of this information.** As a general rule, information provided by you will be used exclusively by us for the purposes of delivering the best possible service and user experience.

In particular:

  1. If you have a publically available profile (for example a Twitter profile which is not set to 'private' or a have chosen to make information on a Facebook or LinkedIn or other profile public), we will (in common with many other services on the Internet) index and present some information from this profile. If you do not wish to have this profile available publicly on the PeerIndex, please visit your user settings page and choose the appropriate option.
  2. However, please note that in common with other indexing services, our crawlers will continue to index any public profiles. We recommend that if do not want to be index by PeerIndex (or similar services) that you set the appropriate privacy controls within 3rd party applications like Facebook or Twitter. You can learn how to do this by visiting those sites directly.
  3. We will use Personal Information provided by you to set up your Member Profile, which is your public face on the site, as well as to register your preferences.
  4. We will share rankings and scores calculated for you with other users. Such information is automatically available on our public site.
  5. We will not share your email address with third parties (save as described below in point 7) unless you explicitly allow us to.
  6. We use cookies and log files to speed up login/access to features and generally enhance the user experience. The information is kept separate from your Personal Information. You may restrict our access to cookies (though this will adversely impact functionality of the site).
  7. No personally identifiable information, that is not already publicly available, will be provided to third parties except as mandated by law or in connection with a sale of the PeerIndex service; such transaction to provide at least equivalent privacy protection.



**Email messages.** Most users do not want their email inbox filled with constant updates from service providers. Our email policy addresses this as follows:

  1. We will inform you of any major improvements to the site, no more frequently than about once a month to once a quarter.
  2. We will not pass on your email addresses to any third parties except as set out in 5 and 7 above.
  3. Regardless of your preferences set under 1. we will still respond to service requests initiated by you (e.g. for a password reminder)



**Access to your information.** If you wish to see the personal information we hold about you, please log in to the Settings section. If you have any further queries or concerns, please contact us at privacy@peerindex.net
