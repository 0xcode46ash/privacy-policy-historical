### Coral

Head of Social Marketing

“PiQ's biggest strength is that it gets rid of the things which stop us getting social marketing done. Tasks like finding influencers, easy reporting, using insight to beat our competition used to be overly complex, or we would have had to pay an agency to do it for us. Using PiQ, these obstacles have been removed and it's helping my team by more efficient, more productive and achieve bigger wins.”
