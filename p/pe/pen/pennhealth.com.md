**1\. UPHS keeps confidential any information we collect through UPHS web sites.  
**We keep confidential any personal information that you provide to us. This information includes your name, postal and email addresses, telephone number and other information you share with us. The personal information you provide is stored in a secure location, and only authorized people are able to access it. We use your data only to provide the information or services you request, answer your questions and determine what information we should develop next for the web site.

**2\. We do not use cookies or other technologies to track identifiable information about users.**  
Our computer system is not configured to track, collect or distribute personal or identifiable information about the people who visit our web sites. We do not automatically gather individual names, email addresses or other individually identifiable information. 

UPHS web sites gather information about visits to the pages on our servers. We maintain statistics that show the total number of visitors to our web sites, requests we receive for pages on our web sites and what domains or Internet service providers those requests come from (such as aol.com). We use this information internally to improve our services. Although these statististics may be provided to others, they do not contain, and cannot be used to obtain, personal information about any individual web site user. 

**3\. We will not send you email newsletters or other electronic communications about services, programs or web site features unless you ask to receive them.  
** You can choose whether or not to receive email communications from UPHS. We will not send you email unless you've requested it. On every email message we send, we include instructions on how to unsubscribe from our email list. If you'd like to be removed from an email list, send an email message to [askuphs@uphs.upenn.edu](mailto:askuphs@uphs.upenn.edu).

**4\. UPHS will tell you if any information you provide us is being submitting through secure or unsecured transfer.  
**To help you use or learn more about UPHS's services and programs, we have posted various contact forms throughout UPHS web sites. To use these forms to contact us or ask us to contact you, you will need to complete the fields of information requested. The information you provide is transferred electronically to the person or people who can assist you with your request.

If UPHS offers secure technology, such as encryption, for you to transfer requested information to UPHS, we will say so on the page.

If we do not offer encryption or a secure transmission for a particular request form, we will say so. Be aware that unsecured information transferred over the Internet is similar to a postcard being sent through the mail. We recommend that you do not send sensitive personal health information to UPHS or anyone else using unsecured means. Should you choose to supply confidential information in this manner, you do so at your own risk.

Information we receive through contact forms is only shared with people who can assist in answering your questions or resolving your concerns.

**5\. Sending email directly to an email address found on the UPHS web site is not secure.  
**Again, unsecured information transferred over the Internet is similar to a postcard being sent through the mail. We recommend that you do not send sensitive personal health information to UPHS or anyone else using unsecured means. Should you choose to supply confidential information in this manner, you do so at your own risk.

**6\. We provide links to other web sites that may have privacy statements that are different from ours.  
**Our web sites contain links to third party web sites that are not affiliated with UPHS. UPHS is not responsible for the content or privacy statements of those web sites. If you are asked to supply personal information to those web sites, we suggest you read carefully those web sites' privacy statements. 

**7.We do not share any individual data gathered online with people outside of UPHS unless you specifically authorize us to share your information or unless it is required by law.  
**In those instances where we need to share information with third parties to make your medical care or treatment more efficient, we will specifically ask for your authorization, exception in emergency circumstances or when we are required to do so by law. 

**8.This web site is intended for use by people age 13 or older.**  
If you are younger than 13, you should get permission from your parents or guardians to use this web site. And, if you are under 13, you should not submit information to this web site. Instead, ask your parent or guardian to submit information on your behalf.
