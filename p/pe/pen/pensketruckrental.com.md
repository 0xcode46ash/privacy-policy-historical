Penske Truck Leasing Co., L.P. and its subsidiaries (“Penske”) understand our customers’ concern about the privacy and the use of their personal information. This Privacy Policy describes Penske’s information practices and applies when customers transact business with Penske or provide personal information to Penske, through Penske’s websites (the “Sites”), rental locations, customer service agents, or otherwise. 

Penske encourages its customers to read this Privacy Policy in full to learn how and why Penske collects and uses the information provided to Penske, and Penske encourages its customers to check back regularly for any updates. Revisions to this Privacy Policy will be posted here and shall take effect immediately upon posting. 

### Collection of personal information

Penske collects personal information in various ways to better serve our customers. Such information may be used to allow customers to order or schedule services, to receive support for the services Penske provides, to allow Penske to contact customers to provide those services, to complete delivery of products and services, and to protect Penske from fraudulent transactions. Penske also uses the information collected to tailor and improve our customers’ experience while using the Sites. 

Once you access the Sites and/or transact business with Penske, Penske may collect personally identifiable information about you. Such personally identifiable information may include e-mail addresses, domain names, addresses and routing information; your name and phone number; your mailing and/or billing addresses; and other relevant data that will better allow Penske to provide information and/or services related to your needs. 

### Collection of aggregate information from Website visitors 

In addition to the personally identifiable information described above, Penske also collects aggregate information from many users regarding the usage of the Sites, such as number of visits, pages visited, and the overall duration of time spent on the Sites. The information collected depends largely on the needs of our customers and what services and features they use on the Sites. Penske does not disclose this information to third parties. 

### Cookie technology

When you enter information or otherwise navigate through the Sites, the Sites use temporary “cookies” during the request process. A “cookie” is a small string of text that a website can send to your browser for storage by your hard drive that allows Penske to provide you with tailored information and services by recognizing your hard drive when you return to the Sites. Currently, Penske uses cookies to keep track of selections you make for information from our Sites. You may opt out of the use of cookies through your browser's options. However, refusing cookies may make certain features of the Sites unavailable. 

### Right to monitor use of the sites

Penske reserves the right, without any obligation, to monitor your use of the Sites for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the Sites' Terms of Use, available at http://www.gopenske.com. Penske further reserves the right to prohibit conduct, communications, or content that it deems in its discretion to be harmful, abusive, offensive or hateful to Penske, its affiliates, or to any of Penske's customers and/or users of the Sites, or that may otherwise violate the law. 

### How we disclose personal information

Penske may, from time to time, share your personal information for the following limited purposes:

  * **Agents and Affiliates:** Penske may distribute your personally identifiable information, both internally within the company and to agents and affiliates as necessary, for purposes related to Penske products and services. Penske also may provide personally identifiable information to certain third parties that have entered into contracts with Penske to provide certain services. Penske may also use this information to help manage programs and services that may be of interest to you. 
  * **Co-Brand Products or Services:** Certain products or services are provided in partnership with identified co-brand partner(s), and when you access Penske products and/or services through co-brand partner(s), you agree that Penske may share personal information (excluding credit card numbers) with such co-brand partner(s). If you elect to purchase or register for products and/or services offered through co-brand partner(s), your personal information will be transferred to such co-brand partner(s) and will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of such co-brand partner(s). Penske does not control such privacy policies and encourages you to review the privacy policies of such co-brand partner(s) closely. 
  * **Marketing Partners for Certain Products or Services:** Penske may share personal information (excluding credit card numbers) with the marketing partner(s) identified in checkout/reservation, but only where you agree during checkout/reservation that you would like your information shared for their marketing purposes. If you elect to have your information shared with such marketing partner(s), your personal information will be transferred to such marketing partner(s) and will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of such marketing partner(s). Penske does not control such privacy policies and encourages you to review the privacy policies of such marketing partner(s) closely. 
  * **Administrative or Legal Process:** At times Penske may be required by law or legal process to disclose your personal information. Penske may disclose information about you, in our sole discretion, if Penske believes that disclosure is necessary (a) to satisfy any law, regulation, governmental request or to respond to a subpoena; (b) to operate this website; (c) to protect the safety, rights or property of Penske or users of this Site or any of Penske's websites; and (d) or as otherwise permitted under this Privacy Policy. 
  * **Business Transfers:** In the event that Penske sells or transfers all or a portion of our business and assets, Penske reserves the right to transfer your personally identifiable information in connection with that transaction. In such event, Penske will use reasonable efforts to ensure that your personally identifiable information remains protected. 



### How we protect personal information

Penske takes appropriate physical, electronic and managerial precautions in our efforts to prevent unauthorized access and use of any data you send Penske. Penske recommends that when you access the Sites, you do so from a secure browser. Penske also recommends that passwords requested/required to access the Sites be a unique combination of letters and numbers in order to protect your information. 

### Third Parties

Penske’s website at http://www.pensketruckrental.com and the Sites maintained therein may contain links to other third-party sites, such as the sites of Penske agents, sales affiliates and other organizations, whose products or services may be of interest to you. Penske cannot be responsible for maintaining your privacy once you leave our Sites. When you click on any links or banners on our Site that take you to third-party web sites, you will be subject to the third parties’ privacy policies. Penske encourages you to read the posted privacy statement of any and every site you visit, whether you are linking from one of our Sites or browsing on your own. 

### Children’s privacy

Penske does not knowingly collect or use any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Should Penske learn that someone under the age of 13 has provided any personal information to or on any of the Sites, Penske will take steps to remove that information as soon as possible.
