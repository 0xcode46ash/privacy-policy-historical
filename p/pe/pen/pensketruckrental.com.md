### **Penske Privacy Policy for Internet Web Sites**

Penske Truck Leasing Co., L.P. and its subsidiaries ("Penske") understand our customers' concern about privacy and the use of their personal information. Use of any information gathered from or about our customers through the Sites shall be governed by the Sites' Terms of Use ([www.pensketruckrental.com/terms-and-conditions/](https://web.archive.org/terms-and-conditions/)) and this Privacy Policy. Penske encourages you to read this Privacy Policy in full to learn how Penske treats personal information obtained while visiting our Sites, and we encourage you to check back regularly for any updates. Use of the Sites indicates your acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy, the Sites' Terms of Use, and Penske's use of your information as described below.

### Collection of personal information

We collect personal information in various ways to better serve you. Such information may be used to allow you to order or schedule services, to receive support for the services we provide, to allow us to contact you to provide those services, to complete delivery of products and services, and to protect Penske from fraudulent transactions. We also use the information we collect to tailor and improve your experience while using the Sites.

Once you access the Sites and/or transact business with us, we may collect personally identifiable information about you. Such personally identifiable information may include e-mail addresses, domain names, addresses and routing information; your name and phone number; your mailing and/or billing addresses; and other relevant data that will better allow us to provide information and/or services related to your needs.

### Collection of aggregate information

In addition to the personally identifiable information described above, we also collect Aggregate Information from many users about use of the Sites, such as number of visits and pages visited, and the overall duration of time spent on the Sites. The information we collect depends in large part upon the needs of your account and what services and features you use on the Sites. We do not disclose this information to third parties.

### Cookie technology

When you enter information or otherwise navigate through the Sites, the Sites use temporary "cookies" during the request process. A "cookie" is a small string of text that a website can send to your browser for storage by your hard drive that allows us to provide you with tailored information and services by recognizing your hard drive when you return to the Sites. Currently, we use cookies to keep track of selections you make for information from our Sites. If you choose to do so, you may opt out of the use of cookies through your browser's options. Refusing cookies, though, may make certain features of the Sites unavailable to you.

### Right to monitor use

Penske reserves the right, without any obligation, to monitor your use of the Sites for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the Sites' Terms of Use [www.gopenske.com]. Penske further reserves the right to prohibit conduct, communications, or content that it deems in its discretion to be harmful, abusive, offensive or hateful to Penske, its affiliates, or to any of Penske's customers and/or users of the Sites, or that may otherwise violate the law.
