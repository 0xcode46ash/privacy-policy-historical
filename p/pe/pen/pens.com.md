**Privacy Policy**

**Information We Collect**  
When you order, we need to know your name, phone number, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number, and credit card expiration date. This information enables us to process and fulfill your order, and to notify you of the status of your order.

**Security**  
We keep the information you give us secure using "Secure Socket Layers" ("SSL"), an industry standard encryption technology. SSL encrypts all ordering information, including your name, address and credit card number, so it cannot be read in transit.

As required by law under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your credit card issuer must limit your liability to $50 in the extremely rare case of confirmed credit card fraud. When you place an order on pens.com, a Federally Insured and Accredited Banking Institution manages the credit card processing.

**Use of "Cookies"**  
"Cookies" are small pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. A cookie allows you to browse the store, put items in your shopping cart and then return several days later to continue where you left off - with the previously selected items still in the cart.

Cookies do not contain any personally identifying information. Accepting a cookie does not give us access to your computer or personal information in any way. It simply tells us where you left off shopping on our website. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can also prevent accepting cookies by changing your browser settings.

**Your Consent**  
Information about the activity of visitors to this site is tracked automatically when you sign in. We use this information for internal review in aggregate and to improve your shopping experience. Monitoring customer traffic patterns and website usage helps us improve the design and layout of the online store.

Based on your online experience, we may send you recommendations for items that may interest you. These communications will only come from National Pen, or those working on behalf of National Pen. We may also notify you of important functionality changes to the website, pens.com services, or special online offers we think you'll find valuable.

In the future, we may make some limited name and address information available to other organizations that provide goods or services we feel may be of interest to you. You can opt out of receiving these marketing promotions at any time. Simply e-mail us at [service@pens.com](mailto:service@pens.com) or notify us when you place an order.
