**How Data are Collected**

  * _Usage Statistics_  
When someone accesses one of the sites listed above, a session ID is generated on our server corresponding to this specific visit. No personal data is available from this connection (i.e. name or email address) apart from the IP of the Internet Service Provider that was used to connect to the site. The purpose of this session ID is to generate usage statistics for the site in total as well as provide the capability to compare usage statistics for certain sections of the site. This information is automatically generated for every person that visits one of our sites. As an example, with these data, we are able to say "X" number of people visited our site last month compared to "Y" a year ago. 
  * _Cookies_  
Cookies are generated within certain sections of our site when it is important to save information submitted by a visitor on prior pages or to store visitors' preferences. Examples of this include placing an ad or using the ad clipboard to save certain ads for later viewing. 
  * _Information Submitted for Ad Placement, Contests, Surveys and Site Registration_  
Much of the data we collect from visitors is voluntarily provided by visitors while completing online forms to place a classified ad or enter a reader contest. The information we request is name, address, phone number, city, state, Zip Code, email address and year of birth. 



  
**Data Collected and Saved for Harte-Hanks Internal Purposes:**

The information we collect is used to notify consumers about advertising they are requesting, contest results, updates to our Web site and is used by us to contact consumers for marketing purposes.  In some cases, some parts of our site that invite you to submit an e-mail to us will result in an automatic reply from us letting you know immediately that your e-mail was received successfully.  In another case, when you submit an online advertisement with us, we will confirm the details of the ad placement using a unique e-mail message to you.  Subsequent e-mail messages are used appropriately to resolve any concerns you may have when placing such PennySaver/Flyer ads (and we are also available by telephone).

If you do not want to receive marketing e-mail from us in the future, please let us know by visiting the following address <http://www.pennysaverusa.com/PrivacyPolicy/optout/>.

  
**Data Collected and Shared with Harte-Hanks Partners:**

From time to time, we make the information of those who access our site available to other reputable organizations whose products or services we think you might find interesting.  In the case of sponsored contests, we may share your entry information with the sponsoring partner or partners for their own subsequent use.  In these cases, these partners may have their own privacy policies with which you may check.

If you do not want us to share your e-mail address with other companies or organizations, please let us know visiting the following address. <http://www.pennysaverusa.com/PrivacyPolicy/optout/>.

  
**Additional Items:**

With respect to Ad Servers: We do not partner currently with or have special relationships with any ad server companies.  (Ad servers are companies that place banner ads or pop-up ads of other unaffiliated companies on Web sites.)

From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically.

If you feel that this site is not following its stated information policy, you may contact us at the address, phone number or email address at the top of this policy.
