### Anonymous data collected through this website

In addition to the information we collect as described above, we use technology to collect anonymous information about the use of our website. For example, our web server automatically logs which pages of our website our visitors view, their IP addresses and which web browsers our visitors use. This technology does not identify you personally, it simply enables us to compile statistics about our visitors and their use of our website. 

Our website contains hyperlinks to other pages on our website. We may use technology to track how often these links are used and which pages on our website our visitors choose to view. Again this technology does not identify you personally – it simply enables us to compile statistics about the use of these hyperlinks. 

### Cookies

The use of “cookies” is a common practice. A cookie is a small piece of information which is sent to your browser and stored on your computer’s hard drive. For example, if you allow a website to remember your login name or password, the website places a cookie on your computer.We may use both session ID cookies and/or persistent cookies. In order to collect the anonymous data described in the preceding paragraph, we may use temporary session ID cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you do not have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance your experience on the Website. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to discover the identity of the user. Cookies do not damage your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. This enables you to decide if you want to accept it or not. If you block cookies, you may not be able to use certain features or functions of our website, or the website may not operate in an optimal mode. 

We also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. An IP address is a numeric code that identifies your computer on a network, or in this case, the Internet. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information. 

We may also perform IP lookups to determine which domain you are coming from (i.e: aol.com, yourcompany.com) to more accurately gauge our users' demographics. 

### Disclosure of your Personal Data

We do not share, sell license, trade, rent or distribute your Personal Data with unrelated third parties, except as otherwise provided for in this Privacy Statement and under these limited circumstances:

  * In order to provide you with the information or products which you have requested, Personal Data may occasionally be transferred or shared with other companies within our group of companies or third party intermediaries who act for us for further processing in accordance with the purposes for which the data was originally collected or for purposes to which you have subsequently consented. For example, sometimes a third party may have access to your Personal Data in order to support our information technology or to handle mailings on our behalf. As such, we may share information with third party intermediaries (e.g., United Parcel Service, Federal Express, Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express) for shipping and billing purposes only. Only the information necessary to provide these services will be shared with the third party intermediaries; these companies do not retain personal information or share it with other parties. The third party intermediaries are further prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We are the sole owner of the information collection on the website.
  * We will keep your contact details on our database and may, from time to time, e-mail or mail you information to make you aware of our other similar products and services which may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive e-mails or mail from us for these purposes, please let us know by following the “unsubscribe” procedure set out above.
  * Where you have consented, we may also share your Personal Data with other companies within our group of companies or disclose your Personal Data to other businesses who may contact you about their products or services that may interest you.
  * We may share, transfer or disclose the information in our databases and server logs to comply with a legal requirement, for the administration of justice, interacting with anti-fraud databases, to protect your vital interests, to protect the security or integrity of our databases or this website, to take precautions against legal liability, or in the event of our sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event. We will inform you of any such transfer or disclosure as required by law.



Where appropriate, before disclosing Personal Data to a third party, we contractually require the third party to take adequate precautions to protect that data and to comply with applicable law.

### Data access and corrections

Upon receipt of your written request and enough information to permit us to identify your Personal Data, we will disclose to you the Personal Data we hold about you, for which we may make a charge up to the maximum as allowed by applicable law. We will also correct, amend or delete any Personal Data that is inaccurate and notify any third party recipients of the necessary changes. To change or remove any Personal Data, please contact us using the contact information given below under the section entitled “Feedback”. Please be aware, however, even if we update your Personal Data, or we remove such information, it may still be stored in other databases (including those kept for archival purposes) and may be used to compile aggregated or demographic information for third parties in accordance with this Privacy Statement.

Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. Our website is not designed to attract or interact with children 13 years and under. We do not collect information from those we actually know are under 13.

### Security

The security of your Personal Data, which includes information about you and your company, is important to us. We want your information to remain secure and strive to provide secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers through industry-standard techniques. Specifically, we have implemented a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure. For example, the servers are located in controlled, secured environments and protected from unauthorized access, use, or alteration. Employee access is restricted to those employees that we consider need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or to do their jobs. All our employees must abide by this Privacy Statement and are subject to disciplinary action if a violation of the Privacy Statement occurs. 

Notwithstanding the above commitments and measures taken to secure your information, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet. There is also some risk that third parties may find a way to thwart the security systems and protective mechanisms that we have enacted to protect your information. No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we continually strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security and privacy of any information you transmit to us. Transmission of information to us is at your own risk.
