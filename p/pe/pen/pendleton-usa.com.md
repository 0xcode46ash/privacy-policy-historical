Whether you're purchasing online or just browsing, your privacy is important to us. Please take the time to review Pendleton's policy for handling your customer information.

The personal information you provide to Pendleton and information about your order may be kept and used by Pendleton. The information we collect may be combined with other personally identifiable information available from our records and other sources, such as purchase history and demographic information. Pendleton may also use "cookies" or other means to passively collect information about your use of our website. (A cookie is a piece of data stored on your computer that lets your web browser talk with Pendleton's web server. It saves you from retyping your user name and password every time you use our secure checkout.) 

Pendleton may share the information it collects with third parties. The information Pendleton collects may be used to improve the content of Pendleton's website, to make our future marketing efforts more efficient, to notify you about current Pendleton products, special offers, services and events, and for other purposes. If you provide us with your telephone number online, we may contact you regarding orders you have placed. 

The information Pendleton collects may also be used by our marketing partners to bring you offers for products and services that may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive our printed catalog, if you do not wish to receive promotional e-mail from Pendleton, or if you do not wish your name to be shared with third parties for marketing purposes, please contact us via e-mail at webmail@penwool.com.

However, any comments, ideas, suggestions, or other information you transmit to the website are not confidential or proprietary. Pendleton will be free to use any comment, idea, suggestion or other information you make available to us through the website, without restriction.

Pendleton takes care to protect the security of your personal information, including your credit card information, from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure.

Pendleton takes care to protect the security of your personal information, including your credit card information, from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your personal on-line order information. To check the security of your connection to our website, look in the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after entering our checkout section. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active and the server is secure. You can also double-check you are in a secure shopping environment by looking at the URL line of your browser. When you are using a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https." If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, please call and place your order by phone at 1-800-649-1512.
