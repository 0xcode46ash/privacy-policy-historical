### How Is My Personal Information Collected By PennyMac?

We collect your personal information when you register through PennyMac registration web pages and each time you update your personal information on any web page.

We may also collect your personal information when you request an interest rate quote or other information from us via a website.

### Does PennyMac Use Cookies or Other Online Technologies to Collect Personal Information from Me?

Some of our web sites may make use of "cookie" technology to measure site activity and to customize information to your personal tastes. A cookie is an element of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then store the cookie on your hard drive. So when you come back to visit us again, we can tailor information to suit your individual preferences. The goal is to save you time and provide you with a more meaningful visit.

Also, when you visit one of the PennyMac web sites, we may collect and store information about your visit on an anonymous, aggregate basis. We use this information only to measure site activity and to develop ideas for improving our sites. This information may include:

  * Time and length of your visit
  * Web pages you looked at on our sites
  * The web site you visited just before coming to ours, and
  * The name of your Internet service provider



We may collect this non-personally identifiable information for the following purposes:

  * To provide anonymous statistical analysis of web page traffic patterns
  * To administer our web site and servers, and
  * To improve our services



Your Internet browser may offer a 'Do Not Track' feature allowing you to tell us you want to opt out of tracking for some purposes. We may not separately respond to or take any action in response to a 'Do Not Track' setting in your Internet browser.

### How We Obtain and Use Information

To service and manage your loan, comply with government regulations, improve our products and services, and better understand your financial situation and needs, we collect and maintain customer and former customer data. We collect information:

  * you provide us on applications, other forms, or verbally over the phone (such as your name, email address, mailing address or other contact information, Social Security, account and phone numbers, assets, income and employment history);
  * about your transactions with us (such as your loan balance, payment history and other account information);
  * about your credit history from a credit reporting agency; and
  * about you or your property from business partners and service providers (such as a property appraisal or purchase contracts).



We only disclose this data to third parties that assist us in providing vital services to you (such as credit reporting agencies, regulators, data processing providers, loan investors, and monthly statement vendors). These service providers are contractually bound to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purposes.

We do not allow third parties to directly collect your personal information from websites we maintain.

### Your Options Under This Notice

You may limit how we share your personal information. This is called a right to "opt out". You have two options to consider:

  * Continue receiving product and services offers without taking any action.
  * Opt out of information sharing. If you want to opt out, please call us toll-free at (866) 586-9210. Please have your account and billing information available when you call.



If you opt out we will continue to share non-public personal information with our service providers (such as monthly statement vendors), and with third parties as required or permitted by law (such as credit reporting agencies).

Notice to CA Residents: We will provide a separate short form notice describing the rights of California residents to opt out under California law, including rights to opt-out of affiliate sharing. We will only share non-public personal information as required or permitted by law.

Notice to ND Residents: We will only share information with our service providers and with third parties as required or permitted by law. We may also disclose your non-public personal information with your written consent.

We will share transaction and experience information (such as your loan balance and payment history) within the PennyMac family of companies.

### How We Protect Your Information

  * setting policies and procedures for carefully handling your information;
  * limiting employee access to sensitive information;
  * protecting against unauthorized access to customer data using data encryption, authentication, and virus detection technology;
  * requiring service providers who do business with us to comply with privacy laws;
  * auditing company security practices;
  * conducting background checks on all employees and providing privacy guidelines after hiring.
