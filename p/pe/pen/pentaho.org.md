    1. (i) Session cookies (cookies which are stored temporarily and deleted once a browser is closed) can be used to help your browser navigate our Websites more smoothly and will identify if you have visited us from a website with which the subsequent website has some relationship (e.g., a website of an affiliated company) and can give helpful information.

We will take the necessary steps to ensure that such onward transfers of personal information comply with applicable data protection laws or the Privacy Shield principles.

### COMPELLED DISCLOSURE

Please note we may be required to disclose your personal information in response to a lawful request by a public authority, including to meet national security and law enforcement requirements. 

### SECURITY

Please keep in mind that while we have established safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access to or misuse of your personal information, we cannot guarantee that it will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Statement (for example, in the event of unauthorized acts by third parties that violate applicable law or our policies). In addition, if a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential.
