Aggregated Statistics

Pen.io may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Pen.io may monitor the most popular pages on the Pen.io site. Pen.io may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Pen.io does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
