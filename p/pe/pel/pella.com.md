# About Pella Windows and Doors - Privacy Policy | Pella.com

Pella Corporation ("Pella," "we," "us," and "our") owns and operates this website (this "Site"). This Online Privacy Policy (this "Policy") describes our commitment to privacy and reflects the importance we place on earning and keeping your trust. 

#### Scope Of This Policy

Pella has provided this Policy so that you will know what personal information Pella collects through this Site, how Pella uses this information, the types of third parties with whom Pella may share this information, and some of the choices that are available to you.

This Policy may be supplemented or amended from time to time by additional privacy notices ("Privacy Notices"), provided at the time we collect your personal information. For example, certain pages of this website may contain privacy notices providing more details about the personal information we collect on those particular pages, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that information. In other cases, specific Privacy Notices may be required to comply with the privacy laws of one of the countries, provinces, or states in which we do business. 

#### What is "Personal Information"?

As used in this Policy, the term "personal information" means information that identifies you personally, alone or in combination with other information available to us. 

#### Your Consent

By using this Site, you are consenting to the collection, use, disclosure, and transfer of your personal information as described in this Policy (and any Privacy Notices that apply to you). If you do not consent to the collection, use, disclosure and transfer of your personal information as described in this Policy (and any Privacy Notices that apply to you), you may not use this Site. You may call 800-728-1017 to request literature, find a local store or request an appointment. _If you have questions about this Policy, or any Privacy Notice, please contact us via e-mail at[privacy@pella.com](mailto:privacy@pella.com)_.

#### Your Choices

We respect your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use, and disclose your personal information. This Policy describes some of your choices. In most cases, however, we will ask you to indicate your choices at the time and on the page where you provide your personal information.

#### This Privacy Policy May Change

Pella reserves the right to update or modify this Policy and any Privacy Notice, at any time and without prior notice, by posting the revised version of the Policy or Privacy Notice on this Site. These changes will only apply to the personal information we collect after we have posted the revised Policy or Privacy Notice on this Site. 

Your use of this Site following any such change constitutes your agreement that all information collected from or about you after the revised Policy is posted will be subject to the terms of the revised Policy. You may access the current version of this Policy at any time by clicking on the link marked "Privacy" at the bottom of each page of the public areas of this Site. 

This Policy was last revised on September 7, 2005 and is effective as of that date.

#### What Information Is Collected on this Site and How Is It Used?

When you access and use this Site, there are three ways we may collect information about you:

  1. _Information You Knowingly and Voluntarily Provide_

Pella collects the personal information you knowingly and voluntarily provide when you use this Site, for example, the information you provide when you request an appointment, request literature or services, or e-mail us with questions or feedback. 

Pella uses the personal information you volunteer through this Site to provide the information and services you request and for any other purpose we identify to you in a specific Privacy Notice. For example, we use the information you provide when you request an appointment to make arrangements for a local Pella expert to contact you to discuss your project. The information you provide about yourself (for example, whether you are a homeowner or a builder) and your project helps us determine how to direct your inquiry. As another example, we use the information you provide when you request literature to send you information about the products that interest you. 

When we collect your contact information, we may ask you if you would like to receive news and special offers from us. If you indicate that you would like to receive our mailings, we will add your contact information to our mailing lists and, from time to time, we will send you newsletters or updates, special offers, or other information about programs, services and products we believe would be of interest to you. In addition, if we provide promotional information or materials to you by email, we will include a link to our "opt-out" page in every email. 

Finally, we may remove the information that identifies specific individuals and study the balance of the information we collect through this Site to improve our programs and services, to improve the content, functionality, navigation and usability of this Site, to better understand the needs and interests of our customers and potential customers, and to better market our programs, services and products. 

  2. _Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser_

Pella collects information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser. This information typically includes the IP address of your Internet service provider, the name of your operating system (such as Windows® or Macintosh®), the name and version of your browser (such as Netscape® or Internet Explorer®), the date and time of your visit, and the pages you visit. The information we receive depends on the settings on your web browser. Please check your browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your settings.

The information provided by your browser does not identify you personally, and we do not normally link this information to any other information that would permit us to identify you. Generally, we use this information to create statistics that help us improve our sites and make them more compatible with the technology used by our visitors. However, we may review our server logs for security purposes, for example, to detect intrusions into our network. The possibility therefore exists that, in the event of criminal malfeasance, we might share our server logs, which contain visitors IP addresses, with the appropriate investigative authorities who could use that information to trace and identify individuals.

  3. _Information Collected By Placing a "Cookie" On Your Computer_

Pella uses "cookies" to "tag" your computer when you visit our Site. A cookie is a small text file our Web server offers your browser. Our cookies contain a randomly generated, unique identification number that lets us identify your computer each time your visit our Site. 

We use these cookies to collect statistical information about the ways visitors use our site – which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page. We analyze this information (known as "clickstream data") in statistical form to better understand our visitors’ interests and needs and to improve the content and functionality of our sites. 

Our web server recognizes the cookies on your hard drive each time you visit our Site. Because we recognize your computer, we do not count it twice. Also, we can use the number assigned to your computer to link the clickstream data we collect each time you visit our Site. This technology helps us determine how many visitors are using our site, how often they return, and how their use of our site may vary over time.

These cookies do not identify you personally and we do not link "clickstream data" with any information that identifies you personally.

If you give us your zipcode when you visit our Site, we will place a cookie on your computer’s hard drive that contains your zipcode information. This cookie does not contain any information that identifies you personally. As you browse our Site, our web server will recognize your zipcode and show you products and services available in your area. This cookie expires automatically after 30 days.

If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. You may also delete our cookies as soon as you leave our Site. Although you are not required to accept our cookies when you visit this Site, you may be unable to use all of the functionality of the Site if your browser rejects our cookies.




#### Does Pella Share My Personal Data? 

Pella may share personal information collected through this Site with companies and organizations that perform services on our behalf, for example, companies that provide support services to us (such as data storage and web hosting services) or that help us market our products and services (such as third-party e-mail marketing companies). These third parties are required by contract to use the personal information we share with them only to perform services on our behalf and to treat your personal information as strictly confidential. 

In addition, Pella may share your personal information with our affiliates and distributors, who may use and disclose that personal information as we would to help us provide the products, services and information you request. For example, if you request an appointment, we will find the local Pella expert nearest you. That Pella expert may be a Pella employee or the employee of a Pella distributor. In either case, the Pella expert will use your personal information to follow-up with you as you requested. Our distributors are bound by contract to use the personal information they receive in relation to this Site only as permitted under this Privacy Policy, any applicable Privacy Notices, and applicable privacy laws. This means, among other things, that they may use your personal information only for the purposes for which that information was originally collected or to which you subsequently consent and must take reasonable steps to protect the confidentiality of your personal information. 

There are other, limited circumstances in which Pella may share or transfer the personal information in our databases to unrelated third parties. For example, we may provide personal information to a third party to comply with a court order or subpoena; to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to comply with a legal requirement; to protect the rights, property or safety of Pella, our users or others; to protect your vital interests; or in connection with a corporate sale, purchase, merger, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or similar event. If your personal information is transferred to another company that has acquired Pella, one of its affiliates, one of its distributors, or one their databases, for example, as the result of a sale, merger or reorganization, the acquiring company’s use of your personal information will still be subject to this privacy policy and the privacy preferences you’ve expressed to us. 

#### How Does Pella Protect Personal Information? 

Pella takes reasonable precautions to provide a level of security appropriate to the sensitivity of the personal information we collect. Although we use reasonable measures to help protect your personal information against unauthorized use or disclosure, we cannot guarantee the security of information provided over the Internet or stored in our databases and will not be responsible for breaches of security beyond our reasonable control.
