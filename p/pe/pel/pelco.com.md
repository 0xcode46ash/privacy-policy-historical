Pelco is committed to protecting your privacy.

This privacy statement does not apply to Pelco products or services. Please read the complete Pelco.com privacy statement

Personal information collected by Pelco often is limited to e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other information when needed.

We use your personal information for the following purposes:  


  * To deliver services, such as newsletters or events.

We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
