# Privacy Statement - Publitas.com

Publitas.com has drawn up this privacy statement (‘Statement’) in order to illustrate the tremendous importance that we attach to the privacy of our customers. Privacy on the Publitas.com website (the ‘Site’) is our main concern. It is because we compile significant data from our visitors and customers that we have drawn up this Statement in order to provide insight into the way in which we collect and process data. We reserve the right to amend this Statement. 

  


### Compiled data

When customers register to use the Publitas application, they are asked to provide certain contact details, such as their name, company name, address, telephone number and email address, financial information and billing details, such as the billing name and billing address, credit card number and the number of users in the organization using the application. Publitas.com uses the compiled data to adapt Publitas to individual users and their organization. This information may also be used to contact customers about their interest in Publitas.com and to distribute information about our company or our partners, for example news about special offers and events. Customers have the option to subscribe to a newsletter via email by providing their email address. We also use e-mail to communicate information about changes to Publitas. We do not share customer email addresses and any personal customer details with third parties. Customers can indicate at any given time that they no longer wish to be contacted by us or receive information from us by sending an email to [support@publitas.com](mailto:support@publitas.com). 

Publitas.com customers use Publitas to host data and information (‘Data’). Publitas.com shall not view, share, distribute, print or refer to this Data except as specified in the Licensing Agreement. In some cases, individual records can be viewed or opened only if deemed necessary to resolve a problem, support issue or deal with suspected infringement of the Licensing Agreement, or as legally required. Of course, customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and safety of their user registration and password. 

Publitas.com can also compile certain information from users, such as Internet addresses. This information is recorded for troubleshooting purposes and to improve the quality of the Publitas. We may also track and analyse data related to statistical use and volume, which incidentally cannot be traced back to individual users. 

If users wish to avail themselves to our referral service to direct an associate to our site, we ask the user to provide the associate’s name and email address. The associate in question will automatically receive a one-time email from Publitas.com with an invitation to visit the site. Publitas.com does not save these details.
