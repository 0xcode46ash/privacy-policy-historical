# Publix Privacy Policy

At Publix, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We developed this Privacy Policy to share with you our information collection practices and the options you have when visiting our Web site. You can always be assured the information we collect is used to provide a more personalized experience for users of this site. This Privacy Policy is an online Privacy Policy, applicable to this site only. By using this site, you are agreeing to accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

Please note that other Publix Web sites may be governed by separate policies. When visiting any of our other sites, please refer to its Privacy Policy.

 **Who is Collecting Your Information**  
Publix and its affiliates are the sole owners of the information collected; except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will not sell, share, rent or loan this information to any third party. However, we may use and share aggregated information that does not personally identify you with third parties in order to improve the site for our users.

The Publix [Apron's](http://www.publix.com/aprons) portion of our site collects a minimal amount of required information from those users requesting a reservation for a Publix Apron's Cooking School class and those users opting in to our Cooking School's printed calendar and/or electronic communication distribution list.  This information is strictly used to process the reservation request or to send the user the requested materials and/or e-mails.  None of the required information and/or optional information collected on any Publix Apron's form is used for other purposes than those stated in this policy; however, Publix may use third parties to assist in providing certain services to users.  In the event that Publix utilizes a third party to provide such services, our contract with the third party will include obligations upon the third party to keep all information obtained during such contract confidential and secure.

The Publix Web site also collects information from users requesting a free subscription to our Publix GrapeTM and Publix FamilyStyle® magazines, as well as our monthly Publix Wine Guide e-mail newsletter. This information is strictly used to process and fulfill the subscription request and/or to send the user the requested magazines and/or e-mails and to confirm that the users are of legal age to receive materials relating to wine and alcohol.  In addition, this section requests optional demographic information to use for internal marketing research to better serve Publix customers.

You should be aware, however, that Publix may share information provided through the Publix Preschool Pals portion of our Web site with third parties under contract with Publix in order to provide Publix Preschool Pals members with the benefits of membership. See the Publix Preschool Pals Child Privacy Notice for more detail. Also, Publix may share information provided when ordering Gift Cards online with third parties under contract with Publix in order to provide services related to the Gift Card purchase transactions.  Such contracts with third parties include obligations upon the third party to keep all information obtained during such contract confidential and secure.

In addition, you should be aware that Publix may use and disclose protected health information as permitted by applicable law, including the Privacy Rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. See the Publix Pharmacy Notice of Privacy Practices for more detail.

Finally, you should be aware that the "Publix Photo Center presented by Snapfish" is a co-branded web site operated by Hewlett-Packard, doing business as Snapfish.  When you visit the Publix Photo Center presented by Snapfish, you will be leaving the Publix Web site.  Publix has no control over the privacy practices of Snapfish and a separate Privacy Policy governs the Publix Photo Center presented by Snapfish.  Consequently, you should review the Privacy Policy that is specifically located on the Publix Photo Center presented by Snapfish Web Site to ensure that you understand, and are comfortable with, how Snapfish collects, stores, retains, uses and shares your personally identifiable information.  


**Protection of Privacy of Children Younger than 13**  
Publix does not target children under the age of 13 and does not expect to sell any of its products or services to children. Although Publix does not target children under the age of 13, we do collect certain information about children from their parents through the Publix Preschool Pals portion of our Web site. Publix's procedures with regard to this information can be found in the Publix Preschool Pals Child Privacy Notice.

**Other Information**  
We collect additional information about how you use and access our Web site. This information enables us to improve the site by making it more accessible and easier to navigate.  

**Cookies**  
By use of this site, you consent to our use of cookies. A "cookie" is a piece of data stored on your hard drive containing information about you. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our Web site. Cookies do not contain any registration information that would personally identify you, as all such data is kept behind our firewall. Nor do cookies allow us to track your usage of other Web sites or the Internet in general. 

**Log Files**  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer our Web site, track customer site navigation and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Sharing**  
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that identifies any individual person. Publix may use your profile information (such as the number of people in your household, the number of pets you have, etc.) to create personalized content, offers, services, and advertising, but this information will only be used by Publix and its affiliates. Publix and its affiliates may release information when required to do so by law (for example, under a subpoena, court order or other regulatory requirement or to maintain or protect the security of the site). 

**Security**  
Publix uses secure connections during the transmission of pharmacy refill transactions, the transaction of Gift Card sales, and in the Preschool Pals section of our site - specifically, with regard to Preschool Pals, those pages dealing with sign in, registration and membership information. This means that information collected during the transmission of pharmacy refill transactions, the transaction of Gift Card sales, and in the Preschool Pals section of our site is encrypted before it is sent over the Internet between your computer and Publix computers. The technology used is called Secure Socket Layer (SSL). Through the use of this technology, your information collected during the transmission of pharmacy refill transactions, the transaction of Gift Card sales, and in the Preschool Pals section of our site is encrypted on your computer, sent through the Internet as jumbled code and decoded on either Publix's secure server or the systems of the third party transacting the credit card sale. You can verify that the connection is secure because you will see a key or a padlock at the bottom of your browser. Another identifier of a secure connection is the URL (or Web site address); the address will change from [http://www.publix.com](http://www.publix.com/) to [https://www.publix.com](https://www.publix.com/) when a secure connection is in place. 

**Surveys and Contests**  
From time to time, Publix or its affiliates may conduct online surveys that ask you for demographic data, such as your ZIP code, age or income level. Publix or Publix's agents may also contact you by telephone or e-mail, using your phone number or e-mail address collected when you filled out one of the forms described in the "What is Collected, and How Do We Use It" section of this Policy, with the option to participate in consumer research studies. Participation in any survey or other consumer research is always voluntary. Publix aggregates the responses we receive before using the information to improve the products and services we offer. We do not link your individual responses to your personal information at any time.

Publix may also ask for some personal information, such as names and e-mail addresses, so that we can contact contest winners and to give you the option to participate in consumer research studies. All of these contests and surveys follow applicable federal and state laws. We will clearly post the rules and terms of each contest. 

**Links**  
Our site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Publix is not responsible for the privacy policies of other sites. We encourage our shoppers to be aware when they leave our Web site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy policy applies solely to the information collected by our Web site. 

**Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

**Contact Us**  
Please let us know if you have any questions about our Privacy Policy. Simply send us an [e-mail](https://web.archive.org/contact/SendUsAMessage.do).
