# Public Interactive—Privacy Policy

  


##  **Public Interactive®** Privacy Policy 

At **Public Interactive,** we believe that protecting the private and personal information of visitors to web sites is both a critical aspect of respecting our audience as well as a good operational policy. We believe that, within a context of full disclosure and choice, both our audience and participating public radio stations can be served by the judicious and careful use of information.

The following privacy policy outlines the philosophy of **Public Interactive** and our operational guidelines for the use of information collected on-line:

  1. **Public Interactive** will never disclose any personally-identifiable information about our audience to any third party without first receiving the user's permission. We will not collect personally-identifiable information from our visitors other than that which is supplied to us on a voluntary basis. 
  2. Visitors to **Public Interactive** affiliate station web sites may voluntarily supply certain personally-identifiable information in connection with (i) sweepstakes or contest registration, (ii) subscription registration for services that may require subscription (such as email newsletters), (iii) requests for membership information to local public radio stations, and (iv) commerce transactions. In addition, personally-identifiable information is voluntarily provided in connection with certain content submissions or community postings (i.e., chat, forums, reviews, or bulletin boards), comments and suggestions, or survey polling. 
  3. Each respective affiliate station in the **Public Interactive** network is provided all collected information, including aggregate user statistics, site reports, and individual user information where such data is collected through the specific station site in an electronic format. Where such information is restricted (per opt-out instructions given by an individual user), participating stations are contractually bound to specific ranges of data use (i.e., use of such data in aggregate format only). 
  4. **Public Interactive** has a responsibility commitment to data security with respect to any information collected on participating station sites. In order to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of any information under our control, we employ industry standard security measures, including SSL encryption and firewall-protected database servers.
