# PublicBookshelf: Privacy

## PublicBookshelf Privacy Policy

PublicBookshelf utilizes third-party advertising companies to serve our ads on the Internet. These third-party advertising companies employ cookie and special technology to determine proper add placement for their clients. This means, these companies gather and analyze anonymous information about your visits to PublicBookshelf as well as other websites. The type of information collected includes:

  * When ads are viewed by visitors
  * What ads are shown
  * Ad cookies
  * IP address



This information may also be used for online preference marketing purposes. 

## Consumer Information

During the process of delivering an ad to you, PublicBookshelf does not collect any personally identifiable information about you—such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address—without your permission. However, PublicBookshelf does obtain some types of non-personal identifiable information—such as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, and your computer operating system (Macintosh or Windows, for example).

PublicBookshelf uses the information for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of our advertisers. In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in response to a specific ad (the advertiser may ask you to fill out a survey or provide your zip code), or in the case where you register for an account. If information is collected, it is for the purpose of maintaining your account and/or passed on to the advertiser for the sole purpose of responding to your request. Additionally, PublicBookshelf may combine your information with that of other users and review it in an aggregate form. We do this in order to understand the type of people who respond to specific types of ads or who visit a particular kind of website or webpage.

## Data Collection 

PublicBookshelf uses “cookies” to enhance your experience on the web. This is a common practice with websites. Cookies are unique numbers PublicBookshelf assigns new users. Each time you return to the website, these cookies help us identify you and better serve you. This cookie is stored on your computer, and it helps PublicBookshelf to target ads and services to you. It may also help prevent you from entering duplicate data every time you visit the site, and alleviates the problem of showing you the same ads repeatedly. At the same time, cookies help advertisers understand what you like and do not like about their ads, so they can cater to your needs the next time you show an interest in their products or services.

While the goal of cookies are to enhance your Internet experience by limiting the number of times you see the same ad and delivering more relevant content to you, they are not required for PublicBookshelf to deliver you ads. If you do not want the benefit of cookies, consult your web browser's help files for information about deleting the cookies from your computer or you may opt out of advertiser cookies [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).
