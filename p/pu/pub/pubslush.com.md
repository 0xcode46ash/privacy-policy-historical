                                          PRIVACY POLICY
1. Introduction
Your consent. When using our Service, you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation,
storage, disclosure and other use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.
Questions. If you have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy, contact our privacy team
at hello@pubslush.com
Scope. This Privacy Policy relates only to Pubslush Press. It does not, however, apply to entities that
Pubslush Press does not own or control, such as Facebook and Twitter.
2. Information We Collect and How We Use It
Browsing Pubslush Press. You can read Submissions and User comments without creating a
Pubslush Press account.
Creating an account and logging in. For some activities on Pubslush Press, such as posting a
Submission, posting a User comment, or Funding a Submission (see below), you will need to set up
an account on Pubslush Press and log in to our Service. When you sign up for a Pubslush Press
account, you provide us with your username, password and date of birth (or a certification that you
are over the age of 13). We will also ask for your email address if you wish to sign up for our
newsletter.
Additional personal information that we collect from Authors. If you are an Author (see
definition in Terms of Service), and wish to have the ability to post Submissions (see definition in
Terms of Service), you will be required to provide additional information. That information may
include the following: your legal name (although only your username will be viewable to other Users
of the site), other biographical information, a personal photograph, your manuscript and other
supporting information. Providing this additional information is optional for Users that are not
Authors.
Content. Our Service is primarily designed to enable Authors to find an audience for their works. By
enabling Submissions and User comments, we create a forum for the Author to do just that. Any
Content posted to the site, including Submissions and User comments are collected and saved by
Pubslush Press.


3. Information Collected by Authorized Third Parties
Service providers and other authorized third parties. Pubslush Press engages certain trusted third
parties to provide services to us, and to help us understand the use of our Service, such as Google
Analytics. These services may collect and record information generated by your use of the Service,
such as your IP address, browser type, time spent on site, how you linked to the site and what sites
you link to after you leave, searches, pages visited, pages commented on, and payments made.
When you make a payment. As a User, you will have the opportunity to “Fund” a Submission. This
means, that you can make a payment towards the publication of a Submission. All payments will be
processed via www.authorize.net. www.authorize.net will store all Funding information, including
the amounts that a User funds, the Submissions that a User funds, and a User’s payment information.
The details of transactions or payments you make on Pubslush Press will also be stored on Google
Analytics.
4. How We Share and Disclose Information
To respond to legal requests and prevent harm. We may disclose your information if we believe
that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety
of any person; to protect the intellectual property rights of others (see “intellectual property rights of
others” section of Terms of Service) to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect
Pubslush Press's rights or property.
Tweets. Our Service will have a Twitter feed which will extract your Tweets and show them on our
site as well. So if you Tweet about a Submission on Pubslush Press, other Users will have the chance
to read your thoughts on our site! You can also Tweet a link to our site to help promote Pubslush
Press. We do not store your Tweets on our site.
“Shares” and “Likes”. If a User clicks a “Share” or “Like” link or button, the User will have the
opportunity to introduce others to Pubslush Press. You can “Share” a link to Pubslush Press via
email, Facebook, Twitter, Blogger, MySpace, Digg, AIM, MSN Messenger, and other services. If
you “Like” a Submission, that information can be shared via those platforms as well. All “Share” and
“Like” links are User generated.
5. How You Can Change or Remove Information

your profile page and clicking “Edit My Profile.” Information will be updated immediately.
Deleting your account. If you wish to delete your account, you may contact us at
hello@pubslush.com and we will promptly remove your account from our system. When you delete
an account, it is permanently deleted from Pubslush Press. You should only delete your account if
you are certain you never want to reactivate it. If you are an Author (see definition in Terms of
Service), as described in our Terms of Service, you may not delete your account at any time within
the period of one hundred and twenty days of posting a Submission, as described in the Terms of
Service.

information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from a child
under age 13, please contact us at privacy@pubslush.com.
