# Pubget: Privacy Policy

Posted on January 3, 2008

We at Pubget, Inc. ("Pubget") respect your privacy. We collect only information that we consider important for bringing you this service, and wherever possible deidentify that information so that it cannot be used to identify you personally. Details are set out below, but check back frequently: we reserve the right to change this policy at any time and without notice; changes will take effect 30 days after they have been posted. The date posted can be found at the top.

## Information we do not collect

Pubget does not collect the username(s) and/or password(s) that you may use for logging in to an institution such as a university, hospital, or library.

In fact, the iframe system that Pubget uses makes it impossible for Pubget to even see these usernames and passwords, much less collect them. Such information is generally provided as part of an independent agreement between you and your institution(s). Pubget **respects** such agreements and makes no attempt to collect this information. We also make no attempt to collect PDFs or other information transmitted to you from publishers.

## Information we do collect

Pubget's mission is to help you access the resources you need. To do this, we issue you a username and password so that you can keep track of your search histories and keepers and keep those and other aspects of your account private. We collect logs of searches and viewed results that contain information about what platform and browser you are using as well as time stamps and IP addresses, as is standard on the Internet. We also use cookies, but only for authentication.

## How collected information is used

We use the information that we collect in order to improve the value of the service. We analyze logs and search patterns in order to monitor, maintain, and improve our performance and to increase the relevance of the information we provide. The logs that we analyze do not contain personal identification information such as usernames, and we make no attempt to link them with the identities of individual users.

We retain the right to share results of our analyses with third parties in order to improve the value of the service and the relevance of the information we provide. However, we do not sell, rent, loan, trade, or lease personal identification information, including emails. By using Pubget, you are agreeing unambiguously that we can collect, keep, and use this information for these purposes. If you disagree, please do not use Pubget.

Finally, we may of course be compelled to provide information as the result of a subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process, in compliance with federal law or state law of Massachusetts.

## How we protect your information

To protect your privacy, we collect and store information on secured and backed-up servers. We ask you for an email address so that we can keep you informed about Pubget and about issues relating to your account. In addition, we configure our list server software to refuse to divulge the email addresses of our list subscribers to anyone but authorized Pubget staff, including other list subscribers.

## Questions about this policy

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us.
