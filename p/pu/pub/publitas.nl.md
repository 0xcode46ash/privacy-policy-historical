# Privacy statement - Publitas.com

[Privacy statement](http://www.publitas.com/en/go/privacy-statement/)  |   [Security statement](http://www.publitas.com/en/go/security-statement/) 

  


Publitas has drawn up this privacy statement (‘Statement’) in order to illustrate the tremendous importance that we attach to the privacy of our customers. Privacy on the Publitas website (the ‘Site’) is our main concern. It is because we compile significant data from our visitors and customers that we have drawn up this Statement in order to provide insight into the way in which we collect and process data. We reserve the right to amend this Statement. 

  


## Compiled data

When customers register to use the e-Publisher application, they are asked to provide certain contact details, such as their name, company name, address, telephone number and e-mail address, financial information and billing details, such as the billing name and billing address, credit card number and the number of users in the organisation using the e-Publisher application. Publitas uses the compiled data to adapt the e-Publisher application to individual users and their organisation. This information may also be used to contact customers about their interest in Publitas and to distribute information about our company or our partners, for example news about special offers and events. Customers have the option to subscribe to a newsletter via e-mail by providing their e-mail address. We also use e-mail to communicate information about changes to the e-Publisher application. We do not share customer e-mail addresses and any personal customer details with third parties. Customers can indicate at any given time that they no longer wish to be contacted by us or receive information from us by sending an e-mail to [support@publitas.com](mailto:support@publitas.com). 

Publitas customers use the e-Publisher application to host data and information (‘Data’). Publitas shall not view, share, distribute, print or refer to this Data except as specified in the Licensing Agreement. In some cases, individual records can be viewed or opened only if deemed necessary to resolve a problem, support issue or deal with suspected infringement of the Licensing Agreement, or as legally required. Of course, customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and safety of their user registration and password. 

Publitas can also compile certain information from users, such as Internet addresses. This information is recorded for troubleshooting purposes and to improve the quality of the e-Publisher application. We may also track and analyse data related to statistical use and volume, which incidentally cannot be traced back to individual users. 

If users wish to avail themselves to our referral service to direct an associate to our site, we ask the user to provide the associate’s name and e-mail address. The associate in question will automatically receive a one-time e-mail from Publitas with an invitation to visit the site. Publitas does not save these details. 

  


## Cookies

Our goal is to make using the Publitas website as easy and useful as possible. When you visit our website, our web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that web browsers send to a computer’s hard drive and are used to determine whether customers or visitors have visited the site previously. 

It is impossible to discover your identity solely on the basis of cookies. Only your browser is recognized. You will remain anonymous to Publitas unless you choose to reveal your identity to Publitas. There are two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies expire as soon as the online session ends. They disappear from your computer as soon as you close the browser software or turn off the computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer even after you have closed the browser or turned off the computer. These cookies contain data including a unique ID for your browser. 

Publitas uses session cookies with encrypted data in order to determine your identity when you are logged on. The e-Publisher application processes your online transactions and requests with the help of this information. The session cookies enable us to verify your identity during the log on procedure. Although users who disable the use of cookies in their web browser can still visit our Site, they cannot use the e-Publisher application. 

  


## Third party sites

The Site includes links to other websites. Publitas is not responsible for the privacy policy or content of the websites in question. Customers and users are responsible for informing themselves about the policies of the other websites. In addition, customers and visitors who visit a linked site may consign personal details. It is up to the user to protect these details. 

  


## Security

Security measures apply to Site in order to prevent the loss, abuse or alteration of the data that we manage. When our site is opened with Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 or higher, SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology using server verification and data encryption is applied in order to provide optimum protection to Data, and makes it accessible only to you. The e-Publisher application is offered in a secure server environment protected by a firewall and other advanced technology in order to prevent abuse by third parties. Lastly, Publitas issues unique user names and passwords that must be entered every time a customer logs on. These security measures prevent access by unauthorized parties, guarantee data accuracy and protect against wrongful use of data.
