**LINKS**  
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Puppies 'N Dogs, L.L.C. is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.

**REFER-A-FRIEND**  
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend’s name and email address.

**SECURITY**  
This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing’. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, at a world class facility.

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can contact us using the Help Center.

**SITE AND SERVICE UPDATES**  
We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone.

**CORRECTING / UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
If a user’s personally identifiable information changes, or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us. This can usually be done at the member account (“my account”) page or visiting our Help Center.

**NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES TO THIS POLICY**  
Puppies 'N Dogs, L.L.C. may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your Puppies 'N Dogs, L.L.C. account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.

These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.
