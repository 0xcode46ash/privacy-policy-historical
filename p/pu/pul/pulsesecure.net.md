**Information Collected**  
Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, email address, phone number, postal or physical address, occupation, industry, or credit card or other payment information, needed to answer a request, to better provide information and services or to comply with various national, state, provincial or local governmental reporting requirements. 

Pulse Secure may collect personal information as described below. In each case, we only collect personal information that we believe to be relevant and required to provide an individual with requested information and services and/or to conduct our business. 

By way of example, we may collect personal information for the purposes set forth below: 

  * Viewing of product demonstrations
  * Accessing of white papers (Note: once you have registered for a white paper or tool, you may visit at any time using your password and user ID.)
  * Participation in marketing promotions
  * Participation in seminars, training courses or events
  * Career opportunities
  * User surveys
  * Secured Partner sites
  * Registration of products
  * Direct marketing by Pulse Securer or its telemarketing service providers
  * Responding to an inquiry
  * Providing technical support or consulting services

  
Pulse Secure may collect, compile and publish statistical information related to the use of and the performance of its platforms and software for marketing purposes, provided that such information is anonymized. Pulse Secure may collect information about the connection, connected appliances, firmware, software and use of its platforms in order to improve or to help resolve any issues with its platform and service and/or to increase end user security. 

Pulse Secure also collects information under the direction of its Platform Clients, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. If you are a customer of one of our Clients and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Clients that use our service, please contact the Client that you interact with directly. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Clients. 

In addition, when accessing certain documents or services on our website or during other marketing activities, visitors may be asked to provide certain information, such as how they can be contacted, where they work, and what they do. We may also track non-personal information about the web pages and content accessed by visitors at the Pulse Secure website and the number of times such content is accessed by a visitor. Pulse Secure collects this non-personal information in an effort to better meet the needs of visitors to its website to answer questions, and to improve delivery of information and services to visitors of the website. 

Also, in the course of performing services for customers, Pulse Secure may be provided access to a customer's networks or systems, and in rare cases, may be able to view or receive portions of personal information of customer's clients. Pulse Secure does not and will not use this information, and if indirectly collected as part of the performance of services, all such information is safeguarded in accordance with this Policy. 

From time to time, Pulse Secure may offer products and services that involve additional privacy-related issues. Please check the product page of our website for information on such additional privacy-related issues. If there are contradictions between this Policy and the more specific information on a product page, then the latter shall prevail. 

**Notice and Ability to Opt-Out**   
When personal information is collected, we typically inform the individual at the point of collection or upon our first communication to the individual the purpose for the collection and where appropriate, allow the individual to elect whether to provide the information to Pulse Secure and/or specify how we can use such personal information. 

Pulse Secure provides individuals who elect to receive electronic or other communications the ability to “opt-out” of those communications by sending us a notice to unsubscribe. Pulse Secure respects your wishes and will discontinue communicating with individuals who have requested not to receive email or other communications from Pulse Secure. This means we assume an individual has given us consent to collect and use his/her personal information in accordance with this Policy unless the individual has taken affirmative action to indicate that he/she does not consent, for instance by clicking or checking the appropriate option or box at the point of collection. In some cases, when applicable, Pulse Secure will provide an individual with the opportunity to “opt-in.” This means that we will require affirmative action from the individual to indicate his/her consent before we use personal information for purposes other than the purpose for which the personal information was submitted. 

Pulse Secure does not alter its data collection based on the presence of a 'do not track' request configured in your browser; however, you may opt-out of data collection performed by Google Analytics. The data collected may be used to improve web site performance and to improve the user experience, in order to provide relevant products and services. You may opt-out from Google Analytics by following the instructions here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/. 

**Sharing, Disclosure and Security of Personal Information**

If an individual chooses to provide Pulse Secure with personal information, the personal information will be used solely by and transferred only to Pulse Secure, its offices and subsidiaries around the world, its resellers and distributors and service providers, which are those companies contracted by Pulse Secure to deliver requested information and services. We may also transfer personal information across borders and from the individual’s country or jurisdictions to Pulse Secure’ offices and subsidiaries, its resellers and distributors and service providers around the world. All such entities are governed by this Policy or are bound by appropriate confidentiality agreements. 

An individual’s personal information is typically not shared outside Pulse Secure without permission, except under conditions explained below. Pulse Secure may send personal information to other service provider companies under any of the following circumstances: 

  * when we have an individual’s consent to share the information;
  * if sharing an individual’s information is necessary to provide a product or service that is requested (If personal information is shared with third parties we will only provide the information they need to deliver the service. Also, such companies are prohibited from using such personal information for any other purpose);
  * as part of a joint sales promotion or to pass sales leads to one of our distribution partners; and
  * to keep an individual up to date on the latest product announcements, product updates, special offers or other information we think he/she would like to hear about either from us or from our service providers (unless the individual has opted out of these types of communications).

  
We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, bankruptcy proceedings, or similar legal process when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. 

If Pulse Secure is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website, of any change in ownership, uses of your personal information, and choices you may have regarding your personal information. We may also disclose your personal information to any other third party with your prior consent.
