## What, exactly, is SSL encryption?

SSL stands for Secured Sockets Layer. The 256-bit encryption essentially means that any information you provide us with is encrypted (encoded and scrambled) in a way that no third party could read it, were they to intercept its transmission.

## Why Do I Have To Re-enter My Credit Card Information on my Pre-Order?

ToyZoo.com complies with industry standards that protect you the customer. ToyZoo.com does not have access to credit card information when the initial order is made. All credit card information is sent directly to our credit card processor and it is not stored on any device or program ToyZoo.com can access. When an order is approved, the only information ToyZoo.com receives is the type of credit card used as well as the last four digits of the card. If more than a few days have passed between the time the initial purchase was placed and when the pre-ordered items are prepared to ship out, the credit card authorization will have expired and the credit card information will have to be entered in again before we can ship the order out.
