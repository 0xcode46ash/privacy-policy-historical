# Privacy Statement

**Privacy Policy**

PUMA INDIA is committed to ensuring the privacy of our customers' personal information, and this privacy notice is designed to voluntarily comply with current privacy legislation.

**COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

PUMA INDIA limits its requests for information to what is required to ensure accurate service. Most of the information we collect is very basic and is needed to complete a purchase or provide a refund. Examples of customer information that may be collected include your name, address, telephone number, email address, etc.

**Navigation Information**

Even if you do not make a purchase on our site, we have the ability to track usage of our web site, including what pages are visited, what products are viewed, and the third-party sites that led you to **Pumashop.in**. This information is not used to track information about individuals, but is used at an aggregate level to customize our site, improve the online experience, and plan advertising and promotions.

**Information Voluntarily Provided**

There are times when you may provide information to us voluntarily. This occurs when you provide feedback to us through emails, letters, or telephone calls. We use this information to respond to your query, to keep track of customer feedback, and to improve our service to customers.

**Internet Database**

PUMA INDIA has created an Internet database to allow customers to store their shipping and billing information, track the status of their order, list previous orders, and retain email preferences. Registration is entirely voluntary, and you have the ability to correct or delete the information at any time. This information is accessed through the " **My Account** " section of the site.

**Marketing Practices**

PUMA INDIA does not sell or otherwise share your personal information with anyone else, such as advertising agencies or marketing companies. We only send marketing information to those customers who specifically sign up for our mailing list. Customers can opt-out of receiving information by using the "unsubscribe" option in any marketing email that they receive or by changing their preferences in the " **My Account** " section of the site.

**DISCLOSURE AND RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

PUMA INDIA will share your personal information internally with those staff members who need it to complete your purchase or carry out your instructions regarding the receipt of marketing information. Authorized PUMA service providers may also have access to this information in order to carry out their responsibilities directly connected with the processing of your purchases or handling of customer service issues. Outside of these activities, we will not disclose your personal information to any third party without your written consent unless  
required to do so by law.

PUMA INDIA keeps your personal information for only as long as required to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. For those customers who have registered for the mailing list, their personal information is kept until we are notified that they no longer want their information stored.

PUMA INDIA, as with many other web sites, makes use of "cookies" to help deliver a better customer shopping experience. They enable our systems to recognize your browser and to offer you valuable services, such as saving the contents of your shopping basket, to allow you to access your account information, and to deliver a more personalized shopping experience.

**ACCURACY AND PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

PUMA INDIA relies on our customers to notify us of any changes in personal information. Should inaccurate information come to our attention, we will investigate and correct the information and, if necessary, advise you of the change. Only those staff members who need your personal information in order to respond to your requests are given access to it. Employees are provided with training and information regarding the proper handling of personal information. All information stored in our computer system is protected from unauthorized access, and information that is stored in document form is kept in secure locations to prevent access by unauthorized persons.

**Transaction Security**

All credit card / debit card payments are done through the bank payment gateways. To be sure you're browsing secure pages for transactions, check your web browser's status bar (located at the bottom of the window) for the closed padlock icon. This icon appears in your web browser to tell you that you are viewing a secure web page. Also, all browsers display an "s" after the "http" (https://) in the web site address to indicate that you are in a secure environment.

**PUMA SAFE SHOPPING GUARANTEE**

We guarantee that every online transaction you make will be 100% safe. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.
