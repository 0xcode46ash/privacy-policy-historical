# Puffin Browser - CloudMosa Privacy Policy

Last Modified: January 16, 2019

This Privacy Policy explains what information CloudMosa collects about you, your usage, and what we may do with that information.

Information can be collected when you use CloudMosa apps (the “ **Apps** ”) and services (the “ **Services** ”). **By using the Apps and Services you agree to the Privacy Policy.** The Privacy Policy for the Apps and Services may change over time at our discretion without prior notice as we refine and add/remove features.

### Information about You

The Apps provide 24/7 Flash support and have no In-App-Purchase items. There is no user account on our cloud servers.

Furthermore, our system is state-less, i.e., once you quit the Apps and leave the Services, it is as clean as you were never there. In practice, there are ways to link your activities together by cross-referencing the logs. Nevertheless, there is no way to link back to your identity such as name, address or phone number.

### Information about Your Usage

We log anonymous activities in the format of standard web logs, whose information includes source addresses, destination addresses and URLs. Once collected from the log servers, the logs are used to generate reports for internal data analysis. The logs are purged after 100 days. The reports have aggregated statistical data, which is insufficient to be cross-referenced to identify any individual user.

### What We May Do with the Information

Logs are used for trouble-shooting and self-defense. Reports are used for debugging and business analytics. However, excessive amount of logs and reports are expensive to maintain. We purge the logs after 100 days and only keep the reports. Logs are only used internally, where recent reports are sometimes used externally, e.g., for fund-raising due diligence.

In principle, we do not comply with external requests for user information. The only exception is that we may cooperate with law enforcement agencies as required by law when we receive a request to aid in a criminal investigation.

### No Log on Web Page Contents

Even though the URLs of the web pages are logged, the contents of the web pages are not logged. In fact, the contents will never be logged, and this policy will be strictly enforced. However, be aware of the possibility of surveillance by intelligence agencies in your home country and our home country.
