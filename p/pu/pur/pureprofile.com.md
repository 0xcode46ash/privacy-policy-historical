# Privacy | Pureprofile

### Disclosure to third parties

We will not sell, trade, give or rent any information to a third party unless:

  1. you have expressly consented;
  2. such disclosure is permitted by the Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy; or
  3. required to do so by law.



When we provide information to third parties, profile information and activity responses are only disclosed to businesses in an aggregate and de-identified format. We never provide any personally identifiable Information about you to a business, unless you expressly grant us permission to do so. This permission will (unless otherwise indicated) generally be required on a case-by-case basis.

**Banking details**

We only disclose your banking details to our bank for the purpose of actioning your redemption requests. This disclosure occurs in an extremely secure and protected online facility.

**Overseas staff handling your data**

The response data for some activities may be analysed and aggregated by staff in our global offices located in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Greece and India. Our staff, including contractors, are required to maintain the same privacy and data protection standards as required under the General Data Protection Regulation.

**Overseas third parties**

Some activities may originate from businesses based outside of your country of residence and accordingly, you agree to allow your activity response data to be provided to these businesses. When this happens, we may need to use third party hosting facilities located outside of your country of residence to ensure your information is constantly accessible and backed up in secure data storage facilities. We will ensure all third party hosting providers used are not permitted access to your information.

**Data matching**

We may share your information with third parties to determine if these parties already hold information about you. We do this for the following purposes:

  * to seek your consent to add the information held by the third parties to your Pureprofile account; and
  * to determine if you qualify for an activity (for example for businesses who want to deploy a survey to individuals already on their database).



If the third party does not hold information about you, we ensure that the information we shared with them is destroyed.

**Linking to other websites**

If you associate your account with another website or online account through a Pureprofile product, we may save any data retrieved via this association into our system. In this case, the nature of the data being transferred will be outlined to you and require your express consent. Read the terms of any application carefully before accepting and using an application.
