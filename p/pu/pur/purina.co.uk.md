We do not intentionally collect personal information from children under the age of 16 except on some of our children's websites. On these websites, we will collect such personal information in accordance with all local laws and regulations applicable to the privacy rights of children. If parents or guardians provide consent for the child to submit personal information, we will ask children only for the personal information necessary to participate in the program for which the child is registering.

**Special note to Children under the age of 16**

Alternatively, you can also ask us to delete any of your child's information by sending us a deletion request form by e–mail/postal mail/ fax to the address given in contact details set out in Question 5 – _How can you see, check, change or delete the personal information you send to us?_
