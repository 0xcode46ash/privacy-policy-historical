**Advisory:** On 19 January 2017, an unknown agent registered the domain name "purplematTh.com" (note the extraneous second "T" in "math"), apparently for the purpose of phishing by pretending to be Elizabeth Stapel. If you have received correspondence from "stapel@purplematTh.com", kindly please forward all messages to Purplemath, at <stapel@purplemath.com>, including header information, if possible. Thank you.
