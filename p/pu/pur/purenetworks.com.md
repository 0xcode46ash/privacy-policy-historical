# Pure Networks: Privacy Policy

  
  


Protecting your privacy is important to Pure Networks. We strive to keep your personal information confidential. By ensuring that you are aware of and understand the Pure Networks Customer Privacy Policy, we can provide you with better service. Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn how we handle your personal information. 

Why we collect personal information 

Pure Networks collects and uses your personal information to give you superior customer service, to provide you with convenient access to our products and services, and to make a wider range available to you. In addition, we use your personal information to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers, and other information we think you’d like to hear about. This may occasionally include information from other technology companies about products and services that can add value to your Pure Networks products. From time to time, we may also use your personal information to contact you to participate in a market research survey, so that we can gauge customer satisfaction and develop better products. 

  
How we collect personal information 

We collect information about you in several ways. For example, we might ask for your contact information when you correspond with us, call us to make a purchase or request service, register to attend a seminar, or participate in an online survey. In addition, when you register a new Pure Networks product or ask to be included in an email mailing list, we collect and store the information you provide in a secure database. 

To save you time and make our web services even easier to use, some areas of the Pure Networks website allow you to create an "Pure Networks ID" using your personal information. Here's how it works: Simply fill out a brief profile—your name, phone number, and email address—then choose a password and password hint (such as the month and day of your birth) for security. The system saves your information and assigns you a personal Pure Networks ID. Next time you order something from the Pure Networks Store or register a new product, you can simply enter your email address and password—the system will automatically look up the information it needs. 

  
When we disclose personal information 

Pure Networks does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: 

  * We may provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Pure Networks under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Pure Networks communicate with you about offers from Pure Networks and our partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
  * At times we may be required by law or legal process to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we believe that disclosure is necessary for the public interest.
  * We may transfer information about you if Pure Networks is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Pure Networks will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

  
How we protect your personal information 

Pure Networks safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser. 

  
Collecting other personal information 

When you browse Pure Networks' website, you are able to do so anonymously. Generally, we don’t collect personal information when you browse — not even your email address. Your browser, however, does automatically tell us the type of computer and operating system you are using. 

  
Our companywide commitment to privacy 

To make sure your personal information remains confidential, we communicate these privacy guidelines to every Pure Networks employee. 

Pure Networks does not knowingly solicit personal information from children or send them requests for personal information. 

Pure Networks' website may contain links to other sites. Pure Networks does not share your personal information with those websites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies. 

If we are going to use your personal information differently from that stated at the time of collection, we will try to contact you via email using the most recent information we have. If you have not given us permission to communicate with you, you will not be contacted, nor will we use your personal information in a new manner. 

The Pure Networks Customer Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time. We encourage you to review the privacy policy regularly for any changes.
