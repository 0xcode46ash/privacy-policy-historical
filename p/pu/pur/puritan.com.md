How We Use “Cookies”  
A “cookie” is a small file stored on your computer by a website which gives you a numeric user ID and stores certain information about your activity on the site. We use cookies to let us know that you are a prior customer and to provide certain features to you (such as information on your product selections as you shop) but we do not store any financial or personal information with cookies. 

We use Atlas, a third party advertising company, to track some of our advertising campaigns on the Internet. Atlas may also collect anonymous information about your visits to our website. This is primarily accomplished through the use of anonymous cookies, and a technology device, commonly referred to as a Web Beacon or Action Tag, which we place on various pages within our website, that allow Atlas to collect anonymous information. We use the anonymous information about your visits to improve the results of our advertising campaigns. 

Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies, but most allow you to choose to prevent the use of cookies. If you disable the use of cookies, certain aspects of Puritan.com may not function properly.
