Personal Information We Collect From You Directly  
We may collect personal information about you in several situations, including when you provide it to us voluntarily. For example, we may collect information when you make a purchase online, contact us with questions, provide feedback regarding our products, sign up for a mobile application, or answer questions about your product interests. You do not have to provide your personal information, but if you decide not to do so, you may limit the features that you are able to access through our Services. 

The personal information we may collect includes:

  * contact information, such as your name, mailing address, email address, and telephone number;
  * financial payment information, such as credit card, debit card, and other financial payment information;
  * account registration information, such as user name, password, and profile information; 
  * information about your intended use of, or questions about, our products; 
  * information about your physical condition (e.g., height, weight, body mass index, etc.), eating habits, exercise goals, and fitness interests;
  * certain other information you may provide to us in your communications or in connection with other products or services, including birthdate, gender, and photographs. 



Other Information We Collect About You  
We also may collect certain information by automated means when you use our Services, including your internet protocol ("IP") address; information about your web browser software and version; if you arrived at the Services through a link from a third-party website, the uniform resource locater ("URL") of the linking page; your mobile device identifier and other information about devices you use to access the Services; and information about your activity while using the Services, such as which pages you choose to view, queries you make using our "search" function, and other information about your account usage.

Like many companies, we may use common technologies to help track your use of our Services, recognize you when you return to the Services, or save your preferences. For example, on our websites, we store small pieces of information in cookies that help us remember you when you return to our website. If you are using a mobile application, we may keep information on your device that lets us identify your account. We also may include web beacons in e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and to identify the IP address of the computer on which they were opened. The information we obtain in this manner helps us customize the services we offer and measure the overall effectiveness of our online content and the products and services we offer. Web beacons also allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the third party.

You may be able to disable cookies by changing a setting in your web browser. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of all the Services features.

We also may collect information about you from other sources, including from social media providers and commercially available sources such as data aggregators and public databases. Please note that we may combine the various types of information we collect about you and use it as described in this Privacy Policy.

Third Parties  
Our Services may provide links to websites or mobile applications operated by third parties for your convenience and information. Websites and mobile applications operated by third parties may also refer you to the Services and use cookies or other technologies to track your usage. All of these websites and applications operate independently from us, and we do not control their privacy practices. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party websites and applications that you use to better understand their privacy practices. Likewise, other than our service providers (which operate under contract with us), we do not control the privacy practices of any third parties with which we share personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. 

How We Protect Personal Information  
We maintain reasonable security procedures to help protect against loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the information you provide through our Services.

Among other safeguards, we use Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") technology to help protect transmissions over the internet of your payment card data. You can confirm that SSL is being used by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure website, the first characters of the website's address will change from "http" to "https." If you are using a web browser or a firewall that does not permit communications through our secure websites, you may not be able to make purchases on our sites.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet or stored on a server can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personal information. If you prefer not to transmit your credit card number over the internet, you can contact us using the toll-free number listed on the website from which you want to order. 

Updates to Our Privacy Policy  
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our privacy practices. We will post a prominent notice through our Services to notify you of any material change, and indicate at the top of the notice when it was most recently updated.

Children's Privacy  
The Company cares about the safety of children and the privacy of their personal information. The Site is intended for a general audience and are not designed for children under 13 years old. Accordingly, we will not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our database. 

If you would like to learn about how to protect your children online, visit the FTC at: <http://www.ftc.gov/kidzprivacy>

Miscellaneous  
Our Services are U.S.-based and therefore, information we collect about you may be stored, processed and accessed in the United States. By using the Services, you consent to the transfer, storage, and processing of personal information about you in the United States.
