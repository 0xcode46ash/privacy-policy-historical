This Policy describes how PFCB collects customer information and uses and shares the information collected. Under this Policy, “Information” means information, including personal information, collected from anywhere, including our restaurant locations in the contiguous United States, our websites at [www.pfchangs.com](http://www.pfchangs.com/) and [www.peiwei.com](http://www.peiwei.com/), and other websites where we post this Policy (collectively, the “Sites”), as well as our other mobile websites, mobile applications, services, tools, and other applications that link to this Policy (collectively, the “PFCB Applications”). This Policy also provides guidance on how to manage the Information that you provide to us. We provide this Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to continue to access PFCB Applications or our services. This Policy should be read in conjunction with the Terms of Service located on our Sites, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Our goal is to collect and use only that Information that we think is required for our legitimate business interests, or that helps us to better understand your interests and improve your experience of using our Services.

**1\. Information We Collect**

> **• Information Collected Directly From You**
> 
> You can browse our PCFB Applications without telling us your name or revealing other personal information about yourself. The Information that we may receive and collect from you depends on what you do when you visit our restaurants or Sites or use other PFCB Applications or the services accessed through or provided by our restaurants or PFCB Applications (collectively, the “Services”). For instance, if you create an account for online ordering, make reservations online or via our mobile applications, fill out customer comment cards, participate in a promotion, or join our customer loyalty programs or email lists, you give us your personal information. You may also give us your personal information when requesting that we contact you.
> 
> **• Surveys and Promotions**
> 
> From time to time, we may request Information from you and other users via surveys or contests or sweepstakes. Participation in these surveys, contests or sweepstakes is completely voluntary. Contact information may be used to notify the winners and award prizes and file winners’ information as required by law. Survey information will be used for the purpose(s) of the survey.
> 
> **• Content You Post**
> 
> PFCB Applications are designed to enable you to communicate with others; any Information or content you post when participating with PFCB Applications and social media sites, plug-ins or other applications becomes public information, depending upon your privacy settings, and is subject to redistribution by PFCB and other third parties. There is no expectation of privacy when posting content or otherwise participating in such interactive forums and we have no control over how other users may use the information you make public. Therefore, you should exercise caution and discretion when disclosing your personal information in a public submission or posting.
> 
> **• Information Collected Through Tracking Technologies**
> 
> In addition to any Information that you choose to submit to us, we and our business partners may use a variety of tracking technologies (including cookies, flash cookies, web beacons/GIFs, HTML5, embedded scripts, e-tags/cache browers/web logs) (“Tracking Technologies”) that automatically (or passively) collect certain information from your computer, mobile, or other access device (“Device”) whenever you visit or interact with the PFCB Applications or third party websites, including your Device identifier, the type and version of Internet browser software you use, and your operating system. We may also collect password information from you when you log in, as well as computer and connection information. During some visits we may use software tools to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, time spent on certain pages and page interaction information. Certain features of our Services are only available through the use of Tracking Technologies. We may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including the following: 
>
>> _Operationally Necessary._ We may use Tracking Technologies required for system administration, to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security or allow you to make use of our Sites’ functionality.
>> 
>> _Performance Related._ We may use Tracking Technologies to assess the performance of our Services, including as part of our analytic practices to improve the content offered through the Services.
>> 
>> _Functionality Related._ We may use Tracking Technologies to tell us, for example, whether you have visited the Sites before or if you are a new visitor and to help us identify the features in which you may have the greatest interest.
>> 
>> _Targeting Related._ We may use Tracking Technologies to deliver content, including ads, relevant to your interests on PFCB Applications and third-party sites based on how you interact with our advertisements or content as well as track the content you access.
> 
> **• Targeted Advertising**
> 
> We may use Tracking Technologies to collect Information about your visits over time and across the PFCB Applications and other third-party web sites, as well as information received from other sources, in order to serve more targeted advertising to you. To serve ads we use a variety of third-party advertising service providers, including networks, data exchanges, ad servers, analytics providers and others. These third parties may use Tracking Technologies to send, directly to your Device, the advertisements and links that appear on the PFCB Applications. They automatically receive your Device identifier when this happens. Their tools may also limit the number of times you see the same ad and help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. Third parties may also use information gathered from your use of PFCB Applications to serve targeted advertisements to you on third-party websites and applications. Some of the advertising service providers may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. If you opt out of receiving targeted ads in this manner, you will continue to receive advertising messages, but they will not be customized to you based on your use of PFCB Applications or third-party websites. If you would like more information about advertisers’ use of tracking technologies and about your option not to accept them, you can go to [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). To learn more about how interest-based information is collected, whether the companies we use are part of an industry network regarding behavioral advertising, or to know your choices about not having information used in this manner, you can go to [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/). Please note that the opt-out is cookie-based and will only affect the specific computer and browser on which the opt-out is applied.
> 
> **• Third-Party Tracking Tools**
> 
> We use Google to serve first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to the PFCB Applications. To learn about Google Analytics’ currently available opt-outs for the Web, [click here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/). To learn more about how Google uses cookies in advertising, you can visit the Google ad and content network privacy policy [located here](http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/). You can opt out of receiving interest-based Google ads, or customize the ads Google shows you, by [clicking here](http://www.google.com/settings/ads)
> 
> **• Browser “Do Not Track” Signals**
> 
> Some third-party browsers provide “do not track” machine readable signals for websites, which are automatically applied by default and therefore do not necessarily reflect our visitors’ choice as to whether they wish to receive advertisements tailored to their interests. As a result, we do not respond to these signals.
> 
> **• Notice Regarding Geo-location Functionality**
> 
> Information gathered from your use of the PFCB Applications may be combined with information from third-party sources to identify your location by state and region (“Regional Location”). Certain of our mobile PFCB Applications have search functionality that gathers aggregate location data about visitors who are in or near our restaurants, and when visitors opt in, allows us to collect information about their precise geographic location (“GPS/Geo-location”). If you agree to have your GPS/Geo-location collected, we may use and retain that data to provide you with information about restaurants in your area or carry out marketing and other activities contemplated by this Policy. When you have GPS/Geo-location software running on your Device, we may only collect that Information as controlled by your privacy settings on your Device.
> 
> **• Mobile Information**
> 
> When you access PFCB Applications on a mobile device, we may use the Information collected for any purpose set forth in this Privacy Policy. For example, we may use the Information to provide you with location-based services, such as advertising, search results, and other personalized content. We may collect Information regarding your mobile carrier, Regional Location and, if you opt in, GPS/Geo-location.
> 
> **• Information About Others/Inviting Friends**
> 
> From time to time you may choose to submit personal information about other people to invite them to use our Services. Inviting friends is always optional. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the PFCB Applications, your email address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.
> 
> **• Information From Other Sources**
> 
> The Information we collect may be combined with information from outside records (e.g., demographic information, navigation information, and additional contact information) that we have acquired in accordance with the law. We may also acquire Information from other sources about your visits over time and across other third-party websites, in order to serve more targeted advertising to you on the PFCB Applications.
> 
> **• Contacting Us**
> 
> When you provide us with Information in connection with a particular activity or sign up for our Services (including by providing an email address or telephone number in connection with that activity or Service), you agree that this action constitutes a purchase or inquiry establishing a business relationship with us. You expressly consent to our communicating with you using the Information you provided to us. This means we may contact you by email, telephone (including by recorded message and with the use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving. You attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide us with the authorization to contact you.

**4\. Important Disclosures, Practices and Contact Information**

> **• Links to Other Sites**
> 
> Our Sites may utilize hyperlinks to access external or third-party sites, which are not controlled by us and, therefore, are not subject to this Policy. We recommend that you check the privacy policies of those third-party sites to determine how the proprietors of those sites will utilize your personal information.
> 
> **• Security**
> 
> We implement security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of information under our control. However, no system can guaranty that there will never be unauthorized access to your Information, and your use of PFCB Applications indicates that you are willing to assume this risk. Nevertheless, credit card security is a high priority and we use SSL encryption software when collecting and transmitting your billing information to our payment processors. If you prefer, we are happy to accept your payment over the phone or in person when you visit one of our restaurants. If you wish to purchase a gift card over the phone, please call us toll free at 1-866-732-4264 and indicate that you wish to purchase a gift card without any information being submitted over the Internet.
> 
> **• What You Need to Do to Protect Your Information**
> 
> There are several measures you can take to protect your Information. One option is simply not to volunteer it to us. As stated above, this approach would allow you to still visit our restaurants or access PFCB Applications; however, you will not be able to use all of our Services, including online ordering, purchases, and reservations. The Federal Trade Commission’s site, [www.ftc.gov](http://www.ftc.gov/), also offers useful information about how to protect personally-identifiable information provided online or through mobile applications.
> 
> **• Children’s Privacy**
> 
> PFCB Applications are targeted for use by adults. We do not currently market to or create special areas for use by children. Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 years. If we discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally identifiable information to us, we will delete the child’s personally identifiable information from our files to the extent technologically possible.
> 
> **• No Rights of Third Parties**
> 
> This Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of our PFCB Applications or our Services.
> 
> **• Disputes**
> 
> Any dispute over our use of your Information or privacy is subject to this Policy and our Terms of Service including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the laws of the United States and the State of Arizona.
> 
> **• Changes to the Privacy Policy**
> 
> We may change this Policy from time to time. You agree that we may notify you about material changes in the way we treat Information by placing a notice on the Sites. The most recent version of the Privacy Policy will always be posted on the Sites, with the “Effective Date” posted at the top of the Policy. You should check the Sites frequently for updates. By accessing PFCB Applications or using our Services after the Effective Date you are deemed to consent to our then-current privacy policy.
> 
> **• Questions or Comments**
