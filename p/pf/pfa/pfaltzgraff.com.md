# Pfaltzgraff Privacy Policy

**_We are committed to protecting your privacy and security._** We cherish the relationship we have with you, and will do nothing to violate your trust in us. Because of this commitment, we never sell, rent or trade email addresses with any other company. And we utilize state-of-the-art security software to protect your financial information.

## **Protecting YOUR Privacy**

When you register your pattern, sign up on the mailing list, vote for future product or order merchandise, we need to ask you for certain information so that we can fulfill your request.  
  
---  
  
## **What information do you need to provide?**  
  
When you place an order, we need to know your name, address, phone number, credit card number and expiration date. This allows us to process and deliver your order, and to send you updated information on your pattern and about our company.

When you send a gift to another address, we need to have the name, address and phone number of that person as well, so we are able to correctly deliver your gift.

If you would like to receive online information from us regarding special sales, information about your pattern or online order and shipping confirmation, you will need to provide us with your email address.  
  
## **Do we share any information with other companies?**  
  
We never sell, rent or trade email addresses with any other company.Â  Occasionally, we make a portion of our mailing list available to carefully screened companies that offer products and services we feel you would enjoy. But, we want to make sure that you have the option to choose what information you would like to receive. If you would like to receive information only from Lifetime Brands*, or do not wish to receive information from Lifetime Brands* or other companies, please contact us by sending email to [Consumer Services](mailto:service@pfaltzgraff.com), or call our Consumer Service Helpline at 1-800-999-2811.

Additional uses of customer information do not in any way identify individuals. Instead they describe our customers as groups; for example, everyone who orders glassware or those who order only gifts. In order to develop better Web tools and services that enhance your shopping experience, we occasionally share this aggregate customer information with select third parties. From time to time we provide statistical information about our consumers, sales, traffic patterns on our Web site and site shopping information. These statistics are used in communications such as trade reports and do not identify individuals.

*Pfaltzgraff, Farberware, Hoffritz and Kitchen Bazaar are brands of Lifetime Brands, Inc.  
  
## **How can I discontinue promotional emails?**  
  
At the bottom of each email is information about removing your name from our email list. Simply follow the instructions and we'll remove your name. Or simply call our Consumer Service Helpline at 1-800-999-2811. Please note that it may take several days for the change to take effect, and you may receive emails during that time.

After you make a purchase, for your convenience we will still send confirmations and information about your order. We may also contact you by phone or postal mail if we have questions regarding your order.  
  
## **What about cookies?**  
  
Pfaltzgraff.com does use cookies to make your shopping experience more efficient, convenient and personalized. Cookies are not required, however, for you to shop our site or to place an order. They can only be read by our servers, and are ready to go to work for you every time you return to Pfaltzgraff.com.

Just so you'll know, a cookie is a very small text file placed on your hard drive. It helps us improve our site design, product selection, services and promotions in ways that serve you better. Cookies are your unique identifier and cannot be executed as a code to deliver viruses.  
  
## **How can you contact us with your questions or comments?**  
  
See [Contact us](https://web.archive.org/CustService/concs.asp?CODIV=0107&UID=2003031411165835) to choose from several methods available to get in touch with us. We're always happy to answer your questions or listen to your comments.  
  
## **Assuring your SECURITY**  
  
## **How do we protect your personal information?**  
  
We use state-of-the-art technology to encrypt your financial information before it is sent. The ordering area of our site is protected this way and is referred to as "secure." Secure transmission is not necessary for our product pictures or general site information and is not used there. This keeps our site faster and your shopping experience more enjoyable. And you never have to worry about sending us your credit card information.

You may have noticed the "VeriSign Secure Site" link on our Shopping Cart and Order Form pages. VeriSign is a well-known Web company that validates site security. The verification process happens in the background every time you place an order at Pfaltzgraff.com. [Click here](https://seal.verisign.com/splash?form_file=fdf/splash.fdf&dn=WWW.PFALTZGRAFF.COM&lang=en) to learn more about VeriSign and our status as a secure site.  
  
## **Does Pfaltzgraff.com use SSL technology?**  
  
Yes, we do. Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology is the gold standard in Internet encryption. This highly sophisticated system scrambles your financial data as it travels from your computer to our Web site, making it useless to anyone but Pfaltzgraff.com.  
  
**As this site continues to expand and offer more products and services, we will update this Privacy Policy. We will post the changes on this page, so you will always be aware of what information we collect, and how we use it.
