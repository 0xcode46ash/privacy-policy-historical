# Privacy Policy - Kintera.com

### Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to Kintera. This statement describes Kintera’s privacy practices for its own Web site, as well as the Web sites Kintera hosts for its customers, including what type of information is gathered and tracked, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared. This privacy statement does not disclose how Kintera’s customers use data collected on Web sites that Kintera hosts for them.

### Personal Information

You can visit [www.kintera.com](http://www.kintera.com/) or any Kintera hosted Web site without telling us who you are and without revealing any information about yourself. However, to access certain portions of the Web site, you may have to submit information such as user-id and password, or to access some services we provide, you may have to give us personal information such as your name and address and e-mail.

To access our transaction programs, we may ask you for your address and/or credit card information. When registering via Kintera services, we may also ask you to choose a security question to answer (such as your mother’s maiden name or your pet’s name). This required information is necessary for us to process transactions, issue a new password if you forget or lose your password, protect you against credit card fraud, and to contact you should the need arise in administering your account.

Our hosted sites may contain surveys, trivia games and other forms for collecting information. Kintera often publishes aggregate results to such surveys on its Web site.

### Information security and quality

We intend to protect the quality and integrity of your personally identifiable information. We have implemented appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures, such as using industry accepted encryption for transmission of credit card information, to help keep your information secure, accurate, current, and complete.

### Web site traffic information

When you arrive at or leave any Kintera hosted Web site, we automatically receive the Web address of the site that you came from or are going to. We also collect information on which pages of our Web site you visit while you are on our hosted site, the type of browser you use and the times you access our hosted sites. We use this information only to try to better understand visitor preferences and to manage the load on our servers.

### Cookies

We sometimes use cookies to collect anonymous information from visits to our sites to help us provide better service. We may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service, but we do so in ways that keep the information anonymous. A cookie is an element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your system. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some areas of some sites may not function properly.

### Disclosure to third parties

We will only share personally identifiable information with a third party if and when the individual submitting this information has permitted us to do so, or if we are required by law to do so.

### Email tools

Kintera offers its customers sophisticated email marketing tools. These tools enable their users to easily execute anti-spam policies, providing simple mechanisms to incorporate unsubscribe functions. Kintera itself adheres to a strict anti-spam policy, making it easy for subscribers to unsubscribe. Kintera also provides Web site visitors who have created personal Web pages email marketing tools. These tools provide convenient ways to communicate with friends and family on a personal level; they are not designed for sending out bulk emails.

### Personalized Web pages

Kintera enables its customers to allow their constituents to create personalized Web pages. Kintera also enables customers to allow constituents to create Web content (including email) that bring visitors to these personalized Web pages. Such personal Web pages as well as the customer associated with these pages, are readily identifiable. By clicking on a link and going to a personal Web page you are agreeing to let Kintera collect information about your session visits. We use this information, and also provide it to our customers, for aggregate statistical analysis only. If a visitor provides personal information on these Web pages, then we make this information available only to the customer associated with the pages.

### Children's Online Privacy Protection

While few, if any, of Kintera generated Web sites are directed towards children, we are committed to comply with applicable laws and requirements, such as the United States' Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

### Links to Other Web Sites

Kintera hosted sites contain links to other Web sites. Kintera is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

### Notification of Changes

### “Donor Bill of Rights”

Kintera, Inc. believes in the rights of donors, subscribes to the Donor Bill of Rights, and to the extent we can, we will encourage our clients to follow its principles. This statement of rights was developed by the following organizations: American Association of Fund Raising Counsel (AAFRC), Association for Healthcare Philanthropy (AHP), Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE), and the National Society of Fund Raising Executives (NSFRE). The full text of the Donor Bill of Rights is as follows (see [http://www.afpnet.org/ethics/ethics_and_donors)](http://www.afpnet.org/ethics/ethics_and_donors):

_Philanthropy is based on voluntary action for the common good. It is a tradition of giving and sharing that is primary to the quality of life. To assure that philanthropy merits the respect and trust of the general public, and that donors and prospective donors can have full confidence in the not-for-profit organizations and causes they are asked to support, we declare that all donors have these rights:_

  * To be informed of the organization's mission, of the way the organization intends to use donated resources, and of its capacity to use donations effectively for their intended purposes.
  * _To be informed of the identity of those serving on the organization's governing board, and to expect the board to exercise prudent judgment in its stewardship responsibilities._
  * _To have access to the organization's most recent financial statements._
  * _To be assured their gifts will be used for the purposes for which they were given._
  * _To receive appropriate acknowledgement and recognition._
  * _To be assured that information about their donations is handled with respect and with confidentiality to the extent provided by law._
  * _To expect that all relationships with individuals representing organizations of interest to the donor will be professional in nature._
  * _To be informed whether those seeking donations are volunteers, employees of the organization or hired solicitors._
  * _To have the opportunity for their names to be deleted from mailing lists that an organization may intend to share._
  * _To feel free to ask questions when making a donation and to receive prompt, truthful and forthright answers._
