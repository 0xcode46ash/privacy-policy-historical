**Automatically Collected Information**

We may use online identification technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, or pixels on some pages of our Site (“Tracking Technologies”). The information we collect using these technologies includes: IP address, browser type and language, access time, and referring website. Cookies are small text files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing a more customized website experience. For example, a cookie can be used to store registration information in an area of the website so that a user does not need to re-enter it on subsequent visits to that area. PwC may use Tracking Technologies from marketing partners on our Site, third party sites, and social media platforms. These Tracking Technologies aid in measuring the efficacy of our marketing and awareness campaigns and to understand how visitors navigate to our Site from a PwC ad. We use this technology to compile aggregated statistics about visitors who interact with PwC online content, to gauge the effectiveness of our ads and to better provide more pertinent information to our visitors.

**Third-Party Analytics**

PwC also uses website analytics providers which may set cookies in your browser.  Site activity information collected by these analytics providers may be combined with personal information held by PwC. For more information about these third-party tools, please review our [Cookie Disclosure](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/site-information.html).

In most cases, you may refuse or delete one or more cookies and still access the Site, but Site functionality may be impaired. After you finish browsing the Site, you may delete Site cookies from your system if you wish.

When we send you emails, we may use technologies to determine whether the email has been opened and whether the links contained within the message have been clicked on. We may combine information collected through these means with other information we maintain about you in order to measure interest in our specific offerings and email campaigns, improve our offerings to specific target audiences, and tailor our interactions with you.

#### Information Use

#### Information Transfer; Privacy Shield Notice

Your information may be transferred outside of the U.S. or your country of residence.

We have taken steps designed to ensure adequate protection for any information so transferred.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and its affiliated U.S. subsidiaries adhere to the EU - U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss - U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information that is transferred from the EEA, its Member States, the United Kingdom, and/or Switzerland to the United States.

Where we transfer personal information outside of the EEA to a country or framework not determined by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for personal information, the transfers will be under an agreement which covers European Union requirements for such transfers, such as standard contractual clauses. The European Commission approved standard contractual clauses are available [here](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en).
