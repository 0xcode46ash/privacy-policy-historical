# Privacy Commitment

**Introduction**

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (the UK firm) (“PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP” or “we”) is strongly committed to privacy issues, and this privacy statement details our approach on such issues. By using this site and submitting any personal data, you agree to the use by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP of such data in accordance with this privacy statement. If you have questions on privacy issues, please email us at [privacy@pwc.com](mailto:privacy@pwc.com "Contact us \(New window\)").

**Data Collection**

We only collect identifiable personal data or information that is specifically and voluntarily provided by a visitor to our site. For example, a visitor to our site may choose to provide information such as name, title, office address, office email address and telephone number in order to: 

  * register for certain areas of the site;
  * contact us for further information;
  * order PwC publications or reference materials;
  * submit a curriculum vitae/apply for a job at PwC;
  * participate in bulletin boards, discussion or message forums;
  * enter ‘quick surveys’, quizzes or benchmarking surveys;
  * participate in "join our mailing list" initiatives; and
  * register for events and conferences.

Visitors are also able to send email to us through the site. Their messages will contain the user’s screen name and email address, as well as any additional information the user may wish to include in the message. **Use of Data**

When a visitor provides personal data to us, we use it solely for the purposes for which it was provided to us as stated at the point of collection (or as is obvious from the context of collection). Examples of the types of use are given in the ‘data collection’ section above.

Our websites do not collect or compile personally identifying information for dissemination or sale to outside parties for consumer marketing purposes, or host mailings on behalf of third parties.

**Sensitive Data**

We do not usually seek any sensitive personal data through this website. Sensitive personal data includes data relating to: race or ethnic origin; political opinions; religious or other similar beliefs; trade union membership; physical or mental health; sexual life or criminal record. In some circumstances, we may be legally required to request certain sensitive personal data, and if you choose to submit sensitive personal data for any reason we will obtain your explicit consent to the collection and use of such data.

**Data Controller**

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (the limited liability partnership registered in England under registration no. OC303525 and with its registered address at 1 Embankment Place, London WC2N 6RH) is the data controller of any personal data collected through this website, and will process such data in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.

**Disclosure to Third Parties**

Our policy is not to share personally identifiable information with any third parties, unless required by law, or unless explicitly requested by a visitor or otherwise as set out in this section. We recognise that your information is valuable and we take all reasonable measures to protect your information while it is in our care.

Personal data which has been submitted to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (UK firm) may be disclosed to other member firms in the PricewaterhouseCoopers network of firms, where this is necessary to meet the purpose for which the visitor has submitted the information. By submitting personal data to this site, the visitor is providing explicit consent to the transfer of such data for the fulfilment of their voluntary requests.

This data is not shared with any member firms in the PricewaterhouseCoopers network of firms for any secondary or unrelated purposes, or shared with any third party, unless otherwise disclosed at the point of collection. If there is an instance where such information may be shared, the visitor will be asked for permission beforehand.

We subcontract some areas such as distribution of publications and organisation of events and conferences, and so if a visitor submits personal data as part of a request relating to these areas, we may disclose certain data to third parties in order to fulfil these requests (e.g. when ordering a publication, we display the party fulfilling the order).

**Security**

We have implemented generally accepted standards of technology and operational security in order to protect personally identifiable data and information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction. In particular, we ensure that all appropriate confidentiality obligations and technical and organisational security measures are in place to prevent any unauthorised or unlawful disclosure or processing of such information and data and the accidental loss or destruction of or damage to such information and data. Only authorised PricewaterhouseCoopers personnel are provided access to personally identifiable information and these employees have agreed to ensure confidentiality of this information. PricewaterhouseCoopers’ policy is to use secure socket layer technology for the protection of credit card information submitted through web forms.

**Access to Information**

If you would like to update any personal data you have submitted through this site, please do so via the original registration page or please email us at [privacy@pwc.com](mailto:privacy@pwc.com).

When personally identifiable information is retained, we do not assume responsibility for verifying the ongoing accuracy of the content of personal information. When practically possible, if PricewaterhouseCoopers is informed that any personal data collected through a Web site is no longer accurate, PricewaterhouseCoopers will make appropriate corrections based on the updated information provided by the authenticated visitor.

If you would like details of the information which you have submitted to us through this site, you have a right of access to such information and you may contact us via the above email address. We may charge for a request for access in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

**Unsubscribe**

Should visitors subsequently choose to unsubscribe from mailing lists or any registrations, we will provide instructions, on the appropriate webpage or in communications to our visitors, or a visitor may contact by email to [privacy@pwc.com](mailto:privacy@pwc.com).

**Data Retention**

The personal data you submit to us will only be retained for as long as is required for the purposes for which it was collected or as required by law.

For example, contact information about visitors (such as information generated though registration for access to areas on the site) will be kept as long as the information is required to completely service the contact request or until a user requests that we delete that information. Mailing list information, discussion posts and email are kept for only the period of time considered reasonable to facilitate the visitor’s requests. Resumes are disposed of when they are either no longer under consideration, or are considered dated by our Human Resources departments. 

**Cookies and Log Files**

We use small text files called ‘cookies’ which are placed on your hard drives to assist in providing a more customised website experience. For example, a cookie can be used to store registration information in an area of the site so that a user does not need to re-enter it on subsequent visits to that area. Cookies are not used to track individual visitors to our site.

The use of cookies is now standard operating procedure for most websites. However if you are uncomfortable with the use of cookies, most browsers now permit users to opt-out of receiving them. In most cases, a visitor may refuse a cookie and still fully navigate our Web sites.

In order to properly manage our website we may anonymously log information on our operational systems, and identify categories of visitors by items such as domains and browser types. These statistics are reported in the aggregate to our webmasters. This is to ensure that our website presents the best web experience for visitors and is an effective information resource.

**Children**

We understand the importance of protecting children’s privacy especially in an online environment. Our sites covered are not intentionally designed for or directed at children 13 years of age or younger. It is our policy never to knowingly collect or maintain information about anyone under the age of 13.

**Third Party Links**

There may be pages on our sites which include links to websites which are owned and operated by third parties and so which do not operate this privacy statement. When you link to other websites, this privacy statement and our privacy practices no longer apply. We encourage visitors to review each site’s privacy policy before disclosing any personally identifiable information.
