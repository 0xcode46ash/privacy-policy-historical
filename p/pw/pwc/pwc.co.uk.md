If you have questions on privacy issues, please email us at [privacy@pwc.com](mailto:privacy@pwc.com "Email privacy team").

## Data collection

We only collect identifiable personal data or information that is specifically and voluntarily provided by a visitor to our site. For example, a visitor to our site may choose to provide information such as name, title, office address, office email address and telephone number in order to:

  * register for certain areas of the site;
  * contact us for further information;
  * participate in "join our mailing list" initiatives



Visitors are also able to send email to us through the site. Their messages will contain the user’s screen name and email address, as well as any additional information the user may wish to include in the message.

## Use of data

When a visitor provides personal data to us, we use it solely for the purposes for which it was provided to us as stated at the point of collection (or as is obvious from the context of collection). Examples of the types of use are given in the ‘data collection’ section above.

Our websites do not collect or compile personally identifying information for dissemination or sale to outside parties for consumer marketing purposes, or host mailings on behalf of third parties.

## Data controller

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (the limited liability partnership registered in England under registration no. OC303525 and with its registered address at 1 Embankment Place, London WC2N 6RH) is the data controller of any personal data collected through this website, and will process such data in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.

## Disclosure to third parties

Our policy is not to share personally identifiable information with any third parties, unless required by law, or unless explicitly requested by a visitor or otherwise as set out in this section. We recognise that your information is valuable and we take all reasonable measures to protect your information while it is in our care.

Personal data which has been submitted to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (UK firm) may be disclosed to other member firms in the PricewaterhouseCoopers network of firms, where this is necessary to meet the purpose for which the visitor has submitted the information. By submitting personal data to this site, the visitor is providing explicit consent to the transfer of such data for the fulfilment of their voluntary requests.

This data is not shared with any member firms in the PricewaterhouseCoopers network of firms for any secondary or unrelated purposes, or shared with any third party, unless otherwise disclosed at the point of collection. If there is an instance where such information may be shared, the visitor will be asked for permission beforehand.

## Security

We have implemented generally accepted standards of technology and operational security in order to protect personally identifiable data and information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction. In particular, we ensure that all appropriate confidentiality obligations and technical and organisational security measures are in place to prevent any unauthorised or unlawful disclosure or processing of such information and data and the accidental loss or destruction of or damage to such information and data. Only authorised PricewaterhouseCoopers personnel are provided access to personally identifiable information and these employees have agreed to ensure confidentiality of this information.

If you would like to update any personal data you have submitted through this site, please do so via the original registration page or please email us at [privacy@pwc.com](mailto:privacy@pwc.com "Email privacy team").

When personally identifiable information is retained, we do not assume responsibility for verifying the ongoing accuracy of the content of personal information.

## Data retention

The personal data you submit to us will only be retained for as long as is required for the purposes for which it was collected or as required by law.

For example, contact information about visitors (such as information generated though registration for access to areas on the site) will be kept as long as the information is required to completely service the contact request or until a user requests that we delete that information. Mailing list information, discussion posts and email are kept for only the period of time considered reasonable to facilitate the visitor’s requests.
