# Shop with Confidence make music for less

PMT Online has now been in business for over twenty years, having started in 1978, and can rightly claim to be the birthplace of recording for musicians. Not only was it the first store of its kind in the world, but PMT Online played an integral role in the development of the Portastudio™ which made multitrack recording affordable to the average musician for the first time, and ushered in the age of the home studio which we take for granted today.

As by far one of the largest retailers in the UK (and indeed, Europe) we have **over 10,000 products** In stock today. 

Above all though, PMT Online's main aim is to help the recording musician get the results they need by delivering the very latest equipment with great advice and service, and all at the most competitive prices around.
