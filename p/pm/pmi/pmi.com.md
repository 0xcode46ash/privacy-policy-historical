To respond to your questions or concerns, to fulfill your requests, or to share knowledge about an issue, we may share information you provide throughout this Web site with one or more of our affiliates.

We also share information provided by our Web site visitors, or generated by your use of our Web site (or both), with service providers (who may be outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland) that have been retained to perform services on our behalf or on behalf of our affiliates.

In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law, (ii) in response to a request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.
