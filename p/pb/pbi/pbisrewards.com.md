This policy applies to the client of record of the PBIS Rewards service and end users of the PBIS Rewards service. If you are an end user of the service, you should also consult with the school or organization who has subscribed to this service as their Privacy Policy may be different than this Privacy Policy.

  * **Student Users**
    * Required Information includes Personal Name (although a letter abbreviation can be used for the first name), Student ID Number (although it is not required to match the Student ID Number used in other systems within your organization).

  * **Student Users** – Information is uploaded to the PBIS Rewards database by an Organizational user with administrative privileges.
