At times, we may share your personally identifiable information with others for various purposes. The following outlines the ways in which your information may be shared with others: 
    1. Agents: We employ other businesses, certain services and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, Service analysis, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They may have access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 
    2. Promotional Offers: We may send offers to you on behalf of other partners. When we do this, we do not give that partner your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, you may opt out in the email or change your preferences. 
    3. Aggregate Information: We may share aggregate information such as demographics and Service usage statistics to advertisers, sponsors or other organizations. When this type of information is shared, the other parties do not have access to your personally identifiable information. 
    4. Opt-in and Opt-out Programs: Throughout the Service you may be presented with opportunities to receive special offers from third parties. An opt-in/opt-out message will ask you if you would like your information to be shared. If you do choose to have your information shared, in an effort to protect you, third parties who have access to personally identifiable information must abide by the current Service privacy policy. However, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other companies, and you should review the privacy practices of such Web Services prior to providing your personally identifiable information. 
    5. Third-Party Ad Serving & Audience and Traffic Measurement Services: The Service may use a third party network advertiser to serve the advertisements on the Service or may use a traffic measurement service to analyze the traffic on the Service. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to this Service and other Web Services you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products or Web Services you might be interested in. Audience and Traffic Measurement Services allow us to collect anonymous traffic and behavior information from our Service by monitoring anonymous visitor activity. Although advertisers or other companies do not have access to the Service cookies, the Service's advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies on your computer if you choose to have your cookies enabled in your browser. Cookies allow third party advertisers to show you advertisements or content you might be interested in. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. 
    6. PBR Subsidiaries and Affiliates: We may share your information (including, without limitation, personally identifiable information) with subsidiaries and affiliates of PBR. 
    7. Business Transfers: The Service or PBR may be sold along with its assets, or other transactions may occur in which your personally identifiable information is one of the business assets transferred. In such a case, your personally identifiable information, which we have gathered, may be one of the business assets we transfer. 
    8. Legal Process: In the event we are required to respond to subpoenas, court orders or other legal process or law enforcement agency request, your personally identifiable information may be disclosed pursuant to such subpoena, court order or legal process or request, which may be without notice to you. 

We may also disclose personally identifiable information to persons, companies and entities whose practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy (e.g. other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, participatory databases, and non-profit organizations) that want to market products and services to you. If the Service shares personally identifiable information, it will provide you with an opportunity to opt out or block such uses. 

  5. **Chat Rooms, Forums And Message Boards.**  
The Service may make chat rooms, forums and message boards available to its users. You are not required to provide any personal information when using these areas but you may choose to do so. If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g. questions for an online chat guest), we may publish your screen name and other information you have provided to us (e.g. transcript of the chat, including your question). If you post personal information online, it will be publicly available and you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. PBR cannot ensure the security of any information you choose to make public in a chat room, forum, or message board. Also, we cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these areas. 
  6. **Links To Other Web Services.**  
You should be aware that when you are on the Service you could be directed to other Services beyond our control. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, the "click" may take you off the Service onto a different Website. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use the Service's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other Websites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If you visit a Website that is linked to our Service, you should consult that Service's privacy policy before providing any personal information. 

We sometimes may offer content (e.g. contests, sweepstakes, auctions, or promotions) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors or users voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity. PBR does not have ultimate control over these third parties' use of such information and our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that third-party ad server may have collected from you. 

  7. **Security.**  
This Service incorporates reasonable safeguards to protect the security, integrity, completeness, accuracy and privacy of the personal information that we may collect and we have put into place reasonable precautions to protect such information from loss, misuse and alteration. Your personally identifiable information is transferred to our computers utilizing encryption software. Only those employees who need access to your information in order to do their jobs are allowed access. Our security policies are reviewed periodically and revised as required. 
  8. **A Special Note For Parents Concerning Privacy.**  
The Service is a general audience Service. We do not currently collect any personal information from children under the age of thirteen on the Service. If in the future, PBR collects personally identifiable information from children, it will do so in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) including, without limitation, obtaining necessary parental consent.

Your continued use of the Service shall constitute your acceptance of such revised privacy policy.
