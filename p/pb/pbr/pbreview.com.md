# pbreview.com - Paintball Reviews and Paintball Fields

[pbreview.com](https://web.archive.org/) / Privacy Policy  
  
Pbreview.com respects users' privacy rights and believes that privacy protections are fundamental to a viable and safe Internet Community. Our goal is to provide Internet services, including an Internet "public square" where people can discuss issues related to the quality of paintball fields, paintball products and other similar issues related to the sport and culture of paintball.

Other than providing a forum for the exchange of views and opinions related to paintball, Pbreview.com does not maintain a relationship with its individual users. Accordingly, Pbreview.com does not endorse the views expressed by its registered users and does not warranty the accuracy or quality of its user postings.

In order to provide a vibrant forum for the collection of information, we need to collect certain user information. The Pbreview.com Web site collects information on users in several ways.

**REGISTRATION**

First, users provide us with certain information such as your name, e-mail address and postal addresses when registering for a user name.
