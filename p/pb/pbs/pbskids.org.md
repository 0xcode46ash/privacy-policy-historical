**For Parents and Caregivers of PBS Kids:**

You have trusted us for many years to provide responsible and quality content for children. As we move into the cyberspace world, this trust becomes even more important to you, and to us. We believe the following promises will improve the safety, value, and enjoyment of your child's visits to our site and our affiliated sites. 

  * We will not collect personally identifiable information from your child.
  * If your child sends us an e-mail with a question or comment, or enters one of our contests, we will respond using his or her e-mail, but will not store it for future communications.
  * If we know that your child is under the age of thirteen, we will collect your permission offline (by postal mail, fax or phone) before we mail any prizes or share your child's personal information with anyone else.
  * If your child submits stories, artwork, comments or anything else to us which is posted at our site, he or she will be identified only by first name, age and state.
  * If you or your child [localize](https://web.archive.org/in_your_town/) on pbskids.org, a [cookie](https://web.archive.org/in_your_town/cookieinfo.html) will tell us your station's call letters. PBS only keeps track of how many computers choose each station. No personal information is stored in the cookie, even if you have entered your name or email address on other parts of PBS Online. You can choose to have your computer [remember](https://web.archive.org/in_your_town/) a different station, or no station at all, at any time. Setting the PBS Kids cookie makes it easier to find your TV schedule and local events, but you do not need to set any cookies in order to play the games or access the pages on pbskids.org. 



We also promise to help children, their families and communities find the information they need to use the Internet safely and responsibly. 

  * When a PBS Kids site is partially funded by outside sponsors, we will mark any underwriter logos with a "sponsored by" tag. We select our underwriters carefully, to ensure that the company's products and services fit PBS standards. PBS Kids sites will not contain advertisements promoting e-commerce or direct links to e-commerce.
  * All links to third party sites are insulated with a PBS Kids bridge page. These pages clearly notify the visitor that he or she is leaving PBS Kids, and offers an opportunity to return to PBS Kids. Each bridge page displays a Web literacy tip, educating visitors how to be safe on the Internet. In the case of a sponsor's link, the bridge page will contain more information about the sponsor's relationship to PBS. Since we cannot be assured that links to outside sites follow our safety or privacy guidelines, we encourage adults and children to discuss these choices together. We are not responsible for the content or safety and privacy practices at any sites linked from our pages.
  * With areas of our site like TechKnow's "[You Be the Judge](https://web.archive.org/did_you_know/ybtj)" and "[Get Your Web License](https://web.archive.org/did_you_know/license)," as well as our "[Know Before You Go](https://web.archive.org/web/20010627171542id_/http://pbskids.org/privacy/literacytips.html)" Web literacy tips, we will continue to empower children by helping them to make informed choices. 



You and your child's use of this site are conditioned on your having accepted these terms. You should check back at this policy frequently, since it is subject to change from time to time, and your continued use of the site is conditioned upon your acceptance of any modifications hereto. 

We want to make this site a place where families can surf together, and where parents and caregivers are happy to have their children interact, learn and play. If you have any comments or questions, we're happy to hear them. This is, after all, **your** site. 

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this policy, send us an e-mail at [kids@pbs.org](https://web.archive.org/writeon/write_this_way/feedback.html). You may also contact us at 1320 Braddock Place, Alexandria, VA 22314 (703 739-5127). Please read the [PBS Online Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/cgi-registry/kidsbridge.cgi?context=pbskids_pbsonline_privacy) for the other sites hosted on our server.
