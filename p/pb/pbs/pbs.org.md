# PBS Online®: Privacy Policy

Nothing is more important to PBS ONLINE than protecting the private information of visitors to our site and other sites hosted on our servers (our "Affiliated Web Sites"). Below you'll find information about our commitment to ensuring the privacy of your and your children’s personally identifiable information (such as your full name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and/or other identifying information) and preserving the integrity of the medium. 

Please read the following carefully. If you have any questions or concerns, please send us an e-mail at [www@pbs.org](https://web.archive.org/cgi-bin/pbsmail?www@pbs.org).

####  _Gathering and Use of Information_

PBS ONLINE and our Affiliated Web Sites will never willfully disclose any personally identifiable information about our audience to any third party without first receiving the user’s permission. We do not collect personally identifiable information from our visitors other than what is supplied to us on a voluntary basis.

Visitors to PBS ONLINE and our Affiliated Web Sites may voluntarily supply certain personally identifiable information in connection with (i) contest or sweepstakes registration, (ii) subscription registration for sites or services which require subscription (such as e-mail newsletters), (iii) requests for membership information to local public television stations and (iv) transactions in shopPBS. In addition, personally identifiable information is voluntarily provided in connection with certain content submissions, community postings (i.e., forums or bulletin boards), comments and suggestions, or voting. 

PBS ONLINE and our Affiliated Web Sites may use such information only for conducting the activities stated above, for internal marketing and promotional purposes, or, on occasion, when shopPBS customer mailing lists are made available to carefully screened companies whose products or services might interest individuals who have shopped on the PBS Web site. (The occasional provision of shopPBS mailing lists to such companies is the only case where such information would be provided to third parties). The extent of such use is always explained at the time a site visitor provides such information. If the visitor does not want this information collected and used by us for the disclosed internal purposes, the visitor is given an opportunity to "opt-out." Our visitors need to recognize, however, that under certain circumstances, if they select to "opt-out" they may not be eligible for certain activities for which the personally identifiable information is needed. (For example, if a contest participant elects to "opt-out" on permitting us to collect and use their personal information, we cannot contact them if they win without using such information.) 

#### _Tracking and Use of Cookies_

PBS ONLINE is a member of the DoubleClick Network which places sponsorship banners on certain, non-kids related Web pages of PBS ONLINE. DoubleClick utilizes special software to track user activity on our site. This software is called a "cookie." DoubleClick's cookie contains no information about you - only a unique number with no meaning whatsoever outside of the DoubleClick Network. DoubleClick uses this number to track the exposure of sponsor banners so a user is not bombarded with the same sponsor message over and over again. DoubleClick does not know the name, email address, phone number, or home address of anybody who visits PBS ONLINE. All users who receive a sponsor message targeted by DoubleClick's technology remain completely anonymous. To find out more about DoubleClick’s policy or to learn how to "opt out" from cookies, visit [ DoubleClick’s site](http://www.doubleclick.net/company_info/about_doubleclick/privacy/) for additional information. 

#### _Privacy Policy for PBS KIDS Sites_

PBS has long been recognized as a source of non-commercial, high quality children’s programming. The adults who care for children trust PBS and our partners to provide a safe, stimulating and entertaining haven of educational programming, projects and services. We encourage parents, and other caregivers to spend time online with their children, to supervise their child’s online activities and to enjoy the interactive activities offered on the PBS sites together.

PBS ONLINE and our Affiliated Web Sites support the goals and guidelines established by the [Children’s Advertising Review Unit (CARU)](http://www.bbb.org/advertising/caruguid.html) of the Better Business Bureau, as well as the efforts of the Center for Media Education (CME) and other organizations’ concerned with children’s online safety and privacy. In order to further our corporate mission of providing a safe, non-commercial environment for children in all media, and to better serve our online audience, we have designed these special guidelines for PBS KIDS sites and any other PBS ONLINE sites that offer kids opportunities to contribute and participate.

 **1\. PBS KIDS content is screened carefully to ensure quality, educational applications.** The PBS ONLINE editorial staff works closely with our producers to guarantee that our sites supply high quality, educational content that goes far beyond the promotion of the companion broadcast program. PBS KIDS regularly monitors our sites to make sure the content meets our standards. We encourage you to send any suggestions or comments about our content to [www@pbs.org](https://web.archive.org/cgi-bin/pbsmail?www@pbs.org).

**2\. PBS KIDS Web sites may contain "links" to other sites, and we select these sites carefully to make sure that, when they are selected, they meet our high standards of decency and integrity.** Although we have taken all precautions to ensure that these links meet our standards when they were selected, we cannot guarantee that the sites have not changed since the time they were selected and that they continue to meet our standards. For this and other reasons, all PBS KIDS links to outside sites contain a "bridge page" to alert users that they are leaving the PBS KIDS Web site. 

**3\. PBS KIDS protects the identity of our visitors by limiting the collection of personal information, with certain clearly noted exceptions.** No child’s personally identifiable information is ever posted online or shared with third parties unless a parent or guardian has provided written authorization by use of a verified e-mail address, fax or ordinary mail (called "snail mail"). Personal information may be collected and used by PBS and our Affiliate Sites in order to provide our visitors with additional ways of obtaining information (such as e-mail responses from producers or program-related newsletters). Whenever a visitor provides identifiable information, it is always explained how the information will be used; if the visitor does not want this information collected and used by us for disclosed internal purposes, the visitor is given an opportunity to "opt out". "Opting-out" may mean exclusion from certain activities for which the identifiable information is needed. (For example, if a contest participant elects to "opt-out" on permitting us to collect and use their personal information, we cannot contact them if they win without obtaining such information.) 

**4\. Information promoting the sale or availability of program-related or non-program-related goods and services may not be included on PBS KIDS Web Sites on PBS ONLINE.** Exceptions to this rule may be made by PBS in special cases for designed instructional material offered at no or nominal cost.
