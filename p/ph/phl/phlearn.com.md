# Privacy Policy Phlearn


    ****PHLEARN.COM WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY****

This PRIVACY POLICY is to inform you, the visitor of [www.phlearn.com](http://www.phlearn.com/) (the “Web Site”) about the policies for collection and use of personally identifiable information on the Web Site, which is owned solely by PHLEARN, LLC. (“PHLEARN”). Sites which are linked to the Web Site may have different policies; please review the privacy policy notices on those sites for details. PHLEARN is always respectful about the privacy concerns of the visitors to the Web Site. As a general policy, no personal information is automatically collected from visitors to the Web Site. The personal information collected through the Web Site will be used solely to allow you to participate in the Web Site activities for which the information is collected.

While you can visit the Web Site without providing us any personal information, we may be required to provide certain forms of personal information for the services provided by PHLEARN to function properly, including, but not limited to, your name, age, sex, address, telephone number and email address. For example, we may ask you for your physical address or email address if you make a purchase or if we hold contests which would require you to provide your name, sex and address and/or contact information. Further, personal information collected in order to participate in bulletin boards or chat rooms is also collected for the purpose of maintaining Site integrity and security and may be used to take action against visitors who post inappropriate material, harass other visitors, or otherwise abuse the activity.

Even if you do not provide us with personal information, your visits to the Web Site may allow us to collect such non-personal information as the type of your computer operating system, your browser and your Internet service provider. In addition, when you visit the Web Site, we may store some information in the form of a “Cookie” on your computer. Most Internet browsers allow you to erase Cookies from your hard drive, block Cookies, or receive word before a Cookie is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions to learn more about these functions. Other use of this information may include internal review of the number of visitors to the Web Site but only in an aggregate and non-personally-identifiable form.

We will collect such information only if you provide it to us voluntarily. If you provide personal information, we will not give or sell your personal information to third parties unless we disclose that intention to you at the time of collecting your personal information. We may, however, provide aggregated information about the Web Site users as a whole, not as individuals, to third parties for certain marketing, advertising or other reasonable purposes.

PHLEARN bears no responsibility for any action or policies of any third parties who collect any information visitors may disclose on the bulletin boards, communication areas or other public forums, if any, on the Web Site.  Further, PHLEARN bears no responsibility once you leave the Site by clicking on any of the links contained within the Web Site.

If the Web Site requests credit card information for payment purposes, PHLEARN will take all commercially reasonable steps to protect that information by establishing a secure connection with your web browser.

To maintain the accuracy of personal information you provide us, please notify us of any changes you wish us to make. To update or remove your personal information from our files, you can contact us by sending an email to info@phlearn.com.  Include your name, address and email address in the message. We will use reasonable efforts to make the changes.
