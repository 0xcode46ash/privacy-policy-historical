# Privacy Policy

Welcome to Phlearn’s website! The use of our website, [www.phlearn.com](http://www.phlearn.com/) and our tutorials (collectively, the “Services”) is governed by our terms and conditions of use and the following privacy policy (“Legal Notices”). Our Services are provided by Phlearn, LLC, an Illinois limited liability company. By using our Services, whether you are a registered user or not, you expressly agree to these Legal Notices which are provisioned to protect both you and us.

Information Collected from Users

We collect information from you in two ways: 1) some personal information is gathered when you register and create an account to use our Services; and 2) some information is collected automatically when you use our Services, such as your Internet Protocol address, certain webpages that you visited, browser type and settings, the date and time of your use, how you used our Services, and cookie data.

Generally, we use this information to: 1) remind us who you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you better, more personalized Services; 2) estimate the size of our user community; and 3) measure certain traffic patterns, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate.

Information we Share with Third Parties

As a general rule, we will not share or otherwise disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the following circumstances: 1) under confidentiality agreement, we may match user information with third party data; and 2) we may disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, 45% of our users are female) in order to describe our Services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.

Sharing by You

You will have the ability to share your User Content with another user(s). If you share your User Content with anyone, we shall have no liability to you (or anyone you share your User Content). We will not make any User Content that you keep private and do no share available to any third party except to a third party authorized by you to access such information or if the law requires.

Information You Generate, Submit and/or Post

You are solely responsible for the information you generate, submit and/or post on our website using our Services (as outlined in our Terms and Conditions of Use). Phlearn assumes no liability for the information you generate, submit and/or post on our website using our Services.

Accessing Your Personal Information

You may edit your personal account information with Phlearn at any time by using your unique identifier and password.

Protecting Your Information

Your personal account information with Phlearn is password protected so that you and only you have access to this personal information and the User Content therein. We recommend that you do not disclose your unique identifier or password to anyone. Also remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you have finished using our Services. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information or User Content.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online Services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
