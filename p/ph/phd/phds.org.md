## Information Collection & Use

### Registration

In order to use parts of this Web site, you must first complete the registration form and/or create a user name and password.  During registration you are required to provide contact information (such as name and email address).  We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest.  

Collected Insight is the sole owner of the information collected on phds.org.  Collected Insight collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site.

### Job Alerts

If you request job alerts from us, we request your name and email address as part of the sign up process.  We verify your email address by sending you a confirmation link that you must visit to start your alerts.  Once you have verified your address, we will send you alerts of new jobs at the interval that you specify.  We may use your name and email address to answer questions that you may send us.

### Posting Jobs

Before posting a job on our site, we request your name and email address as part of the sign up process.  We verify your email address by sending you a confirmation link that you must visit before signing in.  We may use your name and email address to contact you about the status of your job, to answer questions that you may send us, and to inform you of new features of the site.

### Tell-A-Friend

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.  Collected Insight uses this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.  

## Communications from the Site

  


### Service-related Announcements

We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.  For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.  

Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.  If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.

### Customer Service

Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password.  We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes.

### Information Sharing and Disclosure

Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)  
We share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners and advertisers.  This information does not identify individual users. [Describe the sharing practices of what your site does, but be specific in describing your relationship with these third parties.  Define terms such as “partner.] 

We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.  

## Personally identifiable information

We do not share personally identifiable information with third parties except as specified below.

### Service Providers

We use Akismet to provide spam filtering for comments posted on our site.  If you post a comment on blog.phds.org, we will provide your name and email address as well as the contents of your comment to Akismet as part of their spam testing process.  Akismet’s privacy policy can be found at http://automattic.com/privacy/

### Legal Disclaimer

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site

### Choice/Opt-out

If you no longer wish to receive our job alerts, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each alert by contacting us via http://jobs.phds.org/contact/us

## Log Files

As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.  

We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.

 We use third-party tracking services, Google Analytics and Quantcast, that use cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate such as statistics on site usage and traffic volume.  We use this information to improve the site and to describe our site’s audience to prospective advertisers.

## Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. 

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.  A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie for more information about cookies.

We use persistent cookies to store your user name if you request that we remember you when logging in.  We also set a persistent cookie to store your geographical location so that we can set default values in forms on the site that ask for your location.

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use areas of our site that require that you be logged in will be limited. 

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site.  We have no access to or control over these cookies. See “Third Party Advertisers.”

This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by phds.org only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. [See the “Third Party Advertisers” section.]

## Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)

Our third party advertising partner, Google AdSense, and our third party statistics provider, Quantcast, employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. 

To learn more about our advertising company’s use of clear gifs, please go to http://adsense.google.com and to http://quantcast.com

## Third Party Advertisers

Ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by Google AdSense and DirectTrack, our advertising partners.

 Google AdSense and DirectTrack may use cookies and/or clear GIFs on this site, which allow them to recognize a user's cookie when a user visits this site. The information that Google AdSense and DirectTrack collects and shares through this technology is not personally identifiable.  

For more information about our third-party advertisers, or to learn more about the choices available to you regarding this anonymous information, please visit http://adsense.google.com and http://www.directtrack.com

## Links to Other Sites

This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Collected Insight. Please be aware that we, Collected Insight, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  

We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.  

This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site. 

## Blog Comments/Forums

If you use a web forum or post blog comments on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.  We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.

## Access to Personally Identifiable Information

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update it by logging in to your account or by contacting our customer support by visiting http://www.phds.org/contact-info

## Business Transitions

In the event Collected Insight goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred.  You will be notified via email of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

## Changes in this Privacy Statement

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.  If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
