**AS A GENERAL MATTER, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS CHECK WITH YOUR TEACHER AND YOUR PARENTS BEFORE SHARING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF OR OTHER STUDENTS ON ANY INTERNET SITE.**

**Collection and Use**  
  
(1) _Student Information_ \- **This Site will in no event directly ask any student for any personally identifiable information either online or offline, nor will it require any such information for a student to use or access the Site.** However, to assist the School in school administration and providing instruction to its students and tracking student progress, the Site, at the School's sole option, allows the School to input the following demographic and related information about any student: (a) name; (b) password; (c) password hint; and (d) Student ID. **The School, and not Pearson, solely controls, defines and manages the collection, disclosure, communication, management and use of all data, including personal data on this Site.**

(2) _Teacher Information_ \- Each School using the Site must provide the following contact information to the Site: (a) the full name and email address of teachers who will use this Site; and (b) the name of the school district, the name of the school, and the city, and zip code. Once entered, each such teacher selects a user identification and password, enabling him or her to log onto the Site and to enter or modify any student information for students in his/her class. **The entry of all identifiable student personal data or assessment data is the School's responsibility and Pearson assumes no responsibility to enter, collect, or review any such data.**

Pearson will have access to personally identifiable data or information of any student and/or teacher only on an "as needed" basis and solely to provide services to the School in connection with this Site. Pearson will take appropriate, commercially standard steps to keep such information confidential. Pearson will not share any such personal information with any third party, except in the following circumstances: (a) in response to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, to the extent permitted and as restricted by law; (b) when disclosure is required to maintain security and integrity of the Site, or to protect any Site user's security or the security of other persons, consistent with applicable laws; or (c) when disclosure is directed by the School.

Student progress, work and results from taking Site coursework are collected automatically by this Site: (a) to provide customized content; (b) to assign or link to further coursework or resources; (c) to review and track courseware completion and results; and (d) to provide information that may be usable by teachers, administrators, tutors, parents and students for assessing or fostering student learning and progress. Non-personally identifiable data may be aggregated for statistical use by either the School or Pearson and shared with third parties.

**PLEASE CONTACT THE SCHOOL IMMEDIATELY IF YOU NEED A NEW PASSWORD, IF YOU NO LONGER WISH TO USE THIS SITE, IF YOU DO NOT WANT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU OR YOUR CHILD COLLECTED OR COMMUNICATED ON THIS SITE, OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF ANY UNAUTHORIZED USE OR ACCESS TO THIS SITE.**
