This privacy policy together with our terms of use sets out how PhotoBox Limited, part of the Photoways group, ("we", "our", "us") will use any personal data we collect from you, or you provide to us during your use of the on-line photo service (the "website"). 

For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act), the data controllers are PhotoBox Limited of Bridge House, 1st Floor, 63-65 North Wharf Road, London, W2 1LA and Photoways, ZAC des Parriers, 37-39 de Beauce, 785–Sartrouville. We may from time to time use data processors, who are not employees, agents or otherwise connected with us, with whom we have an agreement to process your data ("Data Processors"). 

We respect the privacy of every individual who visits the website. Our policy on the collection and use of personal information is outlined below.

We collect and use personal information in order to: 

  * Administer or otherwise carry out our obligations in relation to any agreement that you may have with us.
  * Anticipate and resolve problems with your service.
  * Carry out market research and the tracking of sales.
  * Create and inform you of products and services provided either by us or by carefully selected third parties that you may be interested in, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes and allow Data Processors to do the same – see Emails and Newsletters below for more information about this. 



In order carry out the above, we need to collect and process personal information about you (including but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, email address, details of your visits to the website and any transactional information in relation to order fulfilment). We may ask you for this information on the website during the registration process or at any subsequent point.

In order to take advantage of some of our services, you may need to supply us with the personal details of a third party (for example, their name and address if you wish to send them some prints). We will not use this information for anything other than providing the service for which the information was supplied. 

We may disclose your first name and last name, to selected third parties, including but not limited to Pro-Gallery owners from whom you have purchased items. The purpose of this is so that a record may be kept by the third parties of who has purchased photo related items from them. It is a condition of your use of our services that you agree to this disclosure of your data.

We will not disclose any personally identifiable information without your permission unless: 

  * We are legally entitled to do so (for example, pursuant to a court order or for the purposes of prevention of crime or fraud). You will be treated as having given your permission for disclosures referred to in this policy.
  * We are in negotiations with a third party for the sale or purchase of any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.
  * We, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.
