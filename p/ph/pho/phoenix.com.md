# Phoenix Technologies - Privacy Policy

Protecting your privacy is important to us. We hope the following statement will help you to understand how Phoenix Technologies Ltd. (Phoenix) collects, uses, and safeguards the personal information you provide on our web site. 

**Information Collection  
** When you browse the Phoenix web site, you do so anonymously. Personal information including your email address is not collected. Your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) and domain are logged to give us an idea of which parts of our web site you are visiting and how long you are spending there. We do not link your IP address to anything personally identifiable. The only other information automatically provided to us is the type of computer and operating system you are using. This information is supplied to us by your browser. 

There are times when we may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal information, including your name, email address, and possibly your postal address, for purposes such as correspondence, email registration, making a purchase, entering a sweepstakes, registering for a new product, or participating in an online survey. 

**Information Use**  
The information we collect is used for internal review and consideration. It may be used to improve the content of our overall Internet site. If you provide us with your email address, or have done so in the past, we may upon occasion send you email. For example, we may use information you have given us to provide a service, measure consumer interest in our various services, or inform you about new products and services. These offers may be based on information you provided in your initial transaction with us, in surveys, or from information that may indicate purchasing preferences and lifestyle. 

We also ask you if you want us to share your personal information with other companies that offer related Crusoe products. It is always your decision whether to receive this information, and Phoenix will respect your wishes. 

**Our Affiliates and Other Sites**  
You should be aware that when you are on the Phoenix site, you may be directed to other sites operated by our customers or other third-party providers that are beyond our control. Some of these sites will have their own separate membership process and privacy policies. Phoenix does not control sites that are operated by others and cannot be responsible for the information practices of these sites. Other sites may set their own cookies, collect data, or solicit personal information. We'll do our best to let you know when you are leaving the Phoenix site. But it is your responsibility to be aware of where you are on the web. It is always a good idea to check the privacy policy and terms of use of any site before offering any of your personal information. 

**Security**  
Phoenix will use diligent efforts to protect the security and integrity of the information you provide to us once it is received on our systems. Unfortunately, when you submit information about yourself to Phoenix over the Internet, the information may travel over many systems that are not under the control of Phoenix. The Internet is not 100 percent secure, and others may intercept the information that you are sending.   
Phoenix does not market to children. We do not solicit data from them. No information should be submitted to, or posted at, the Phoenix web site by guests under 18 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. 

**Your Acceptance of These Terms**  
By using this site, you signify your assent to the Phoenix Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, do not use our site. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Phoenix site following the posting of changes to these terms means you accept these changes.
