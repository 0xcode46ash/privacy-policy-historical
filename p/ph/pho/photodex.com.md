Photodex Privacy Policy

Photodex Corporation uses any personal information entered on this or any of our sites only to process your requests and notify of important product updates. At no time will your personal information be made available to an outside party, or used to send unsolicited mail. 

Certain personal information is required when you engage in certain activities on this site. Personal information is collected on this site when you enter information into one of the online forms. 

These forms are used in several different places: 

  * Online ordering / product registration 
  * Requesting technical support on a product 
  * Creating a member account on one of our sites (such as PictureCD.com) 



In the case of online ordering and product registration, your information is used to process your order, generate your product registration, and deliver products. This information is not shared with any other organization. 

For technical support requests, your information is used as part of our quality assurance program. We may use the information to contact you regarding your support issue. 

Creating a member account uses your personal information to validate and protect your account. 

Photodex Corporation does not send unsolicited mail. Photodex may occassionally notify you of product updates and releases. 

In situations not related to a specific product, such as creating a member account on PictureCD.com, Photodex provides an option to 'opt-in' to these occasional product notifications. If you do not opt-in, you will not receive e-mail from Photodex aside from account maintenance messages (necessary to create and maintain your account). 

At no time will Photodex make your e-mail address available to a third party. The personal information you provide to Photodex will never be used by an outside company, and will never result in unsolicited (spam) e-mail. 

To continue receiving product upgrade notifications after your information changes, simply notify Photodex Corporation of your new information. 

Updates may be sent to:
