Photoxels works incredibly hard to ensure that the information contained within the pages of our site is accurate, relevant and of the highest quality. This privacy statement is written to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy.

No personal information is collected on this site, except as you voluntarily provide us. When you take part in a contest, we do require that you are able to provide adequate proof of identity.

However, any correspondence you have with us is treated with the strictest confidentiality and any personal info you provide is _used only for the purpose specified_. No personal information or IP address is ever revealed to any third party. No information is sold, exchanged or divulged for any commercial purpose.

The company that hosts our site do collect information on their server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you request. We have access to those log files. We do not examine IP addresses on an individual basis, but examine only aggregate totals for unique visits, page views, and megabytes downloaded per month. 

When you shop at one of the vendors who advertise on our site, you are dealing directly with that vendor, who is then responsible for the privacy of any personal information you choose to divulge to that vendor. Photoxels has no access to any personal information you provide those vendors, nor do we have responsibility or liability for their independent policies. For more information of the privacy policy of these vendors and other vendors who advertise here, please see the Privacy Notice for that vendor (Read privacy notice of [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/468496/002-3121096-8593660), [Amazon.ca](http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/918814/701-5313004-2193152), [TribalFusion](http://www.tribalfusion.com/www/about/privacy.html), [Shopping.com (Dealtime)](http://www.shopping.com/xCPT-about_privacy), [AllPosters](http://www.allposters.com/help/guarantee.asp#privacy)). Likewise, any product support you may require is available only from the appropriate vendor in question.

We are strictly against the use of spywares that collect information from readers. We deplore sites that automatically download spywares to their viewers' computers and strictly prohibit their use within our site. If you have reason to believe that you are encountering spywares on visiting our site -- or a site we link to -- please let us know so we can address this issue immediately. 

Advertisers automatically forfeit any monetary claims should they post inappropriate content.

This website contains links to other sites that operate independently and are not under our control. We provide links to other sites for your information and convenience. Other sites will have their own privacy notices; please review and ensure you agree with them if you visit any linked sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices, and/or the content, of sites we link to or that link back to us.

Our website uses contact forms for customers to request information and send feedback.
