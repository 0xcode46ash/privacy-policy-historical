Privacy policy – Pho.to

This statement describes our privacy policy. Pho.to reserves the right to revise this policy at any time without notification to you, so please re-read it often in connection with your use of the Pho.to website.

Your personal information at Pho.to

We will never share your e-mail address or other identifiable information with any third party without your explicit consent. The following legal document will dictate how we will handle this information.

This privacy policy together with our [Terms of Service](http://pho.to/terms.php) sets out how VicMan, ("VicMan" or "we") will use any personal data we collect from you, or you provide to us during your use of our online services ("Pho.to" or the "website").

We respect the privacy of every individual who visits the website. Our policy on the collection and use of personal information is outlined below.  
We will only disclose your information without your authorization in the following situations: 

  * To the authorities when necessary to comply with the law (i.e. answering subpoenas).
  * To enforce or to apply our Terms of Service and other agreements. 
  * We are in negotiations with a third party for the sale or purchase of any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.
  * To protect the rights, property, or safety of Pho.to, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.



You are giving your consent to disclose your personal info (photos, albums, etc.) in the following situations:

  * You upload a web album or a 3D album to Pho.to site either using our software or Photo! Presentation Widget service ([http://pho.to/widget3d](http://pho.to/widget3d/)), or using other options at Pho.to website.
  * You share images with the "Share it!" button situated to the right of any of the Pho.to services. 
  * You share your photo at Pho.to site using any of the Pho.to services and share a link to this photo elsewhere on the internet. 



We do not disclose your photos, which you have uploaded for editing and manipulation to any of the Pho.to services and which you see in the [file selection panel](http://pho.to/press/file-selection.php) at the top of a service page. These photos are stored at Pho.to temporarily and are visible only to you from the same IP address and from the same browser. These photos will be deleted from our server in 12 hours.

Non-Personal Details

We may automatically collect non-personal information about you, such as the type of browsers you use or the website from which you linked to us. This information is only used to assist us in providing an effective service on the website. We may, from time to time, supply the owners and operators of third party websites which have a link to our site with information about the number of users linking to the website from their website. You cannot be identified from any of this information.

Cookies

We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report information to our branded partners.

We may store some information on your computer when you visit the website. This information facilitates your use of the website, and ensures that you do not need to re-enter your details on each visit. The information stored in a cookie provides features that recognize your account as logged on and other site features. We do not have any control over cookies which our advertisers or branded partners may use on the website.

Security

The technology that we use and the policies that we have implemented are intended to safeguard your privacy from unauthorized access and improper use. We will continue to update these measures as new technology becomes available.

Newsletter

You can opt-in to receive our newsletter. This information will not be sent to you if you ask us not to include your name on our mailing lists. In many places where personal information is collected, we have a box that you can check indicating that you would like to "opt out" if you don't wish to receive further information of the sort indicated. If you have previously consented to have Pho.to send you its newsletter and no longer wish to be contacted, please follow the link at the bottom of each newsletter to unsubscribe. 

Username and Password Recommendations

We advise you to choose a password that is not easily guessed by others and a username that does not identify you personally (i.e. don't use your real name as your username). Please make sure that your password is 6 or more characters and is composed of both letters and numbers. In addition, it is recommended that you use a separate password for every website to which you are a member. This is a form of damage control, in case the security of one website is compromised, your other accounts are still protected. Should you forget your Pho.to password, it will be emailed to you at your request.

Updating or Deleting Your Information

You can delete any photos, albums or optional information in your account settings. Any required information (with the exception of your username), will be completely hidden from the public, or an option to hide it from the public will be made available. 

Links, Hosted Sites & Advertisers

We do not have any control over the privacy practices of any external websites linked from the main www.pho.to domain (or any of the websites that are hosted on our server and aren't affiliated with Pho.to). Therefore you should review their privacy policies separately from ours and know that we in no way have any control over their practices. 

Third party advertisers may collect certain information that is available to them through your interaction with their advertisements. VicMan has no control or knowledge as to their practices and it is suggested that you read their privacy policy separately before clicking on any advertisements. 

Questions?

If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Statement, the practices of Pho.to, or your dealings on our web site, please [contact us](mailto:customercare@vicman.net).
