### Privacy Policy

**Information Collection and Use**  
photoSIG is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. photoSIG collects information from our users at several different points on our website. 

**Registration**  
In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. Cookies enable us to track users as they travel from page to page within the site and allow us to present the site as a coherent whole.

**Log Files**  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

**Sharing**  
We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

We may partner with other parties to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third parties to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

**Links**  
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, photoSIG, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

**Surveys & Contests**  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

**Tell-A-Friend**  
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask the user for the friend's name and email address. photoSIG will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit this site. photoSIG stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.

**Security**  
This website takes reasonable measures to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**  
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us.

**Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our main page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
