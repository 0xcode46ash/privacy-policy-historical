Personal information includes, but is not limited to, name, physical address, email address, phone number and any other information that itself identifies or, when tied to the above information, may identify you as a specific individual.

We also keep track of your visits to the site and all purchases you make through us with this information.

**With Whom Your Information Is Shared and How It Is Used**  
When you provide information to PhotoBiz, the information is stored in our databases and such information is passed onto the partner photographer or vendors who are responsible for fulfilling photo orders to your event. PhotoBiz reserves the right to contact you about your account at any time. Information we collect is used to tailor your experience at our site, to show you content that we think you might be interested in, and to display the content according to your preferences. We also use such personal information to send you information and promotional materials regarding our service. Your contact information may also be used if it becomes necessary to contact you.

We may share your personally identifiable information with those companies that assist us in providing PhotoBiz service to you, known as third party service providers. We outsource all domain & hosting companies which need information. We also may share personally identifiable information (not including credit card information) with third parties that assist us with the administration or fulfillment of photo ordering.

In addition to the circumstances described above, we may disclose your information if required to do so by law, court order, as requested by other government or law enforcement authorities, or in the good faith belief that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable, including (without limitation) when we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities.
