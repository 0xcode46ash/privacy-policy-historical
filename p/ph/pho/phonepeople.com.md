This policy governs transactions on this website, however, additional covenants and conditions may exist in the case of orders for which a separate agreement exists between the parties.

We collect no personal information about you unless you choose to provide that information to us. We do not give, share, sell, or transfer any personal information to a third party without your consent.

**Links to Other Sites:**

When you leave this website you will be going to sites that are beyond our control. These other sites have their own privacy policies, and may collect data or solicit personal information.

**Non-personal Information We Record:**

If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website, read pages, or download information, our website's operating system will automatically record some general information about your visit for our statistical analysis and quality assurance purposes. During your visit, our system will record: 1) The type of browser (such as "Netscape version X" or "Internet Explorer version X") that you are using. 2) The type of operating system that you use (such as Macintosh, Unix, or Windows). 3) The date and time you visit our site, and the web pages which may have transferred you to our site. 4) The first page you visited on our site. 5) Your IP address for geographic identification.

**Cookies:**

What are cookies? A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your browser when you access a website. The use of cookies is an industry standard. You will find cookies at most all major websites. There are two kinds of cookies.

  * A session cookie is a line of text that is stored temporarily in your computer's RAM. Because a session cookie is never written to a drive, it is destroyed as soon as you close your browser.
  * A persistent cookie is a more permanent line of text that gets saved by your browser to a file on your hard drive. Depending on your browser settings, you may receive notification that a given site is requesting cookie information, possibly with an expiration date. Persistent cookies have an expiration date in the future. Persistent cookies are not harmful; they simply help the server remember you when you return to a website.



Whenever possible, we use "session cookies". They exist to help you navigate between pages without having to retype information, such as on multi-page forms. On those pages where we use "session cookies" to facilitate your use of our site, we do not collect any personal information about you and the cookie will be destroyed as soon as you exit your browser. With session cookies, there is no information stored on your computer and no unauthorized files are written onto your disk drives. A session cookie is destroyed as soon as you close your browser.

**Information from e-mail you send to us:**

If you decide to send us an electronic mail message (e-mail), the message will usually contain your return e-mail address. If you include personally-identifying information in your e-mail because you want us to address issues specific to your situation, we may use that information in responding to your request, and log the transaction for quality assurance purposes. However, we do not sell or rent this information to third parties. Also, e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. Please send only information necessary to help us process your request.

**Voluntary Submission of Information:**

On some of our web pages we offer forms that let you voluntarily submit personal information (such as e-mail, name, and payment information). For example, this occurs when you are ordering our service(s). In the case of orders, all submitted information is governed by the agreement for that transaction. In other cases, all submitted information is used only for the expressed purposes for which it is intended and is not made available to any third party.

**Site Security:**

If you use our website, you should understand that all activities may be monitored and recorded. Anyone using this system expressly consents to such monitoring. If such monitoring reveals possible evidence of criminal activity as related to our business or website, monitoring records may be provided to law enforcement officials.
