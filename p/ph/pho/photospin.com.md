If you supply us with your postal address online you may receive mailings from other reputable companies. We will not share your phone number. You can, however, have your name and address put on our do-not-share list by sending email to us or simply unchecking the box in your "Account" area. If you provide us with your exact name and mailing address, we will make sure your name is removed from the list. 

Persons who supply us with their telephone numbers online may receive telephone contact from us with information regarding orders they have placed online. They also may receive telephone contact from us with information regarding new products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such telephone calls, please let us know by sending email to us or by unchecking the box giving us permission under "Account." Please provide us with your exact name, mailing address, and phone number.
