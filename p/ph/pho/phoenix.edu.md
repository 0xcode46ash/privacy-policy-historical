## Information You Provide to Us

In addition to information automatically collected by your browser, University of Phoenix also collects information that you provide when you register for an online service, order merchandise from us, or request information regarding one of our programs.

  * _Via Registration Sites_  
The University's registration sites, such as our library, and the student and faculty websites, require visitors to provide contact information and/or unique identifiers when they register. Information collected may include a user's name, address, e-mail address, as well as unique identifiers, such as their Social Security number or student ID number. Contact information is used to contact our visitors if necessary. Unique identifiers are utilized to verify the user's identity prior to granting visitor access to some of the services available online. Opt-out policy: You can choose NOT to register. While you will be able to access most of our sites, you will not be able to access areas that require registration.
  * _Via Ordering Sites_  
Our ordering sites, such as the Emporium Online (University of Phoenix Store), allow customers to request products from the University and require visitors to provide contact information and financial information such as credit card numbers. Contact information is used to send product orders to the customer, as well as to contact the customer if necessary. Financial information collected is used to bill the user for the products ordered. Opt-out policy: You can choose NOT to disclose your financial information online. Instead, you can call the ordering site at the phone number(s) listed and provide the information needed to complete your order. Please see the security section below.
  * _Via Information Request Sites  _  
Many of our sites provide users the opportunity to request information from the University. These information request sites require users to provide the University with contact information, as well as information about their interest in University of Phoenix. Contact information is used to send information about University of Phoenix to the customer requesting that information. Customer interest information is collected to determine what information the customer wishes to be sent. Opt-out policy: You could choose NOT to provide this information online. Instead you can call the University and request to have information sent to you.
  * _Via Survey Sites_  
Many of our sites also allow users to let the University know how we're doing. Our survey sites, such as feedback on the student and faculty websites and comments to the chair, request customers to provide contact information as well. The contact information that's collected is used to contact the customer, if necessary. Opt-out policy: You can choose NOT to disclose contact information when you submit survey information to us. However, if your comments require follow-up by a member of the University, we will be unable to do so when contact information is not available.

## Definitions

### Cookies

Data created by a web server that is stored on a user's computer. It provides a way for the website to keep track of a user's patterns and preferences and, with the cooperation of the web browser, to store them on the user's own hard disk.

The cookies contain a range of URLs (web addresses) for which they are valid. When the browser encounters those URLs again, it sends those specific cookies to the web server. For example, if a user's ID were stored as a cookie, it would save that person from typing in the same information all over again when accessing that service for the second and subsequent time during the same browser session. 

You can opt out of the use of cookies by having your browser disable cookies or warn you before accepting a cookie. Look for the cookie options in your browser in the options or preferences menu. 

NOTE: If you disable cookies in your browser, you will not be able to access any of the University's secured websites. 

### IP (Internet Protocol) Address

This is the address of a computer attached to a TCP/IP network. Every client and server station must have a unique IP address. Client workstations have either a permanent address or one that is dynamically assigned for each dial-up session. IP addresses are written as four sets of numbers separated by periods; for example, 204.171.64.2.

### Browser Session

A browser session is defined as the period of time a browser is in consecutive use. The session begins when you open the browser and ends when you close it. When you reopen the browser, you begin a new session.

### SSL Encryption (Secure Sockets Layer)

This is the leading security protocol on the Internet. When an SSL session is started, the browser sends its public key to the server so that the server can securely send a secret key to the browser. The browser and server exchange data via secret key encryption during that session. We also use SSL encryption whenever we display your personal information (e.g., name and address, scheduled courses, grades).

### URL (Uniform Resource Locator)

This is an Internet address. URLs are used to locate sites on the Internet and to navigate between sites and pages within sites. The URL for University of Phoenix is http://www.phoenix.edu/.

Internet Explorer and Windows are registered trademarks of Microsoft Corporation in the United States and/or other countries. Macintosh is a registered trademark of Apple Inc. in the United States and/or other countries.
