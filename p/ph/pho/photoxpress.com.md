We have taken certain security protections in safeguarding your personal information. However, as with most electronic transactions, no method is 100% safe. While we strive to use a commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its security. Therefore, PhotoXpress assumes no liability regarding the theft, loss, alteration or misuse of personal or other information, including without limitation such information that we have provided to third parties, or with regards to the failure of a third party to abide by the privacy policy or agreement between PhotoXpress and a third party.
