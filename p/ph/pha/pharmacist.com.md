Aphanet.org also may disclose personally identifiable information as is required or appropriate in order to comply with the law.

 **V. How we protect the information you provide on aphanet.org**

This section of the Privacy Policy explains how the information that you provide when you register for aphanet.org, conduct transactions on aphanet.org, or enroll as an APhA member is protected against unauthorized use.

We will undertake procedures to help to ensure that the information you provide to us is protected against loss, misuse, alteration, destruction, or unauthorized access. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online,

The information stored in your profile and CE Center account is protected by the user name and password that you were provided when your aphanet.org account was created. You may change your user name and password at any time by logging onto aphanet.org, clicking "My Account" then "Change Password." You are encouraged to change passwords periodically and to protect your user name and password as you would other personally sensitive information.

Whenever you are finished using the aphanet.org site, you are encouraged to log out by clicking the "log out" button located on the home page and most other pages within the site. To prevent others from accessing your personal account information, it is particularly important to log out if you are using a shared or publicly accessible computer.

All information that you provide on aphanet.org is stored in a database residing on servers that are secured against unauthorized access both by physical and software means. Physical access to the servers is tightly controlled. Access to your information by employees of APhA, and third parties working on aphanet.org or providing services under contract to APhA is on a "need to know" basis, in which access is permitted only for specific jobs or job functions (for example, billing clerks or customer service representatives).

Credit card and other personal information that you provide on aphanet.org is transmitted over the Internet using a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) connection. SSL is the industry-standard method for protecting confidential Web communications, such as credit card numbers, online forms, and financial data, from interception and hacking.

APhA take’s commercially reasonable steps to secure the information collected on aphanet.org. In addition, you can do your part to protect the information collected on aphanet.org about you by securing your aphanet.org user name and password, as described above, and by logging out when you finish using the site. However, you should be aware that despite the security procedures that APhA employs, no security system is impenetrable nor can we guarantee that the information you provide will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet. You should particularly note that although it is illegal to intercept or disclose these messages under Federal law, Internet e-mail is not secure, so you should not send confidential or personally sensitive information via e-mail.
