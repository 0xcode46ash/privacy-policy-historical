# About Phase One

**Privacy Statement**

 Your privacy is important to us, therefore Phase One has created this privacy statement in order to let you know our firm commitment to your privacy.

Our privacy commitment covers Phase One’s website ([www.phaseone.com](https://web.archive.org/)) and our products and services.

 **What information of yours does Phase One collect**

 We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you ("personal information") or allows us to contact you. Generally this information is requested when you want to purchase our products, when you want to request a product demo, when you register for our newsletter, when you want to download our software, when you have support requests or when you want to be notified on updates and news for your products.

When you register, we may ask you for information such as your name, e-mail address, shipping address, and product information (such as license code, serial number, make and model).  
Your IP address is used to help identify you and your time spent at our sites, and to gather broad demographic information. This allows us to see which parts of our sites users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable.   
When a user submits personal information, it is kept on a Phase One internal server, not accessible from the Internet. This limits the risk of any malicious use of your information.

You can change or correct registered information for your Phase One profile online at our website. If you experience problems submitting such changes you can contact Phase One support via our website.  
If you have registered information about products you use or own with us, you can modify or delete these registrations online via our website or via the latest Capture One software.

If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still use most of our website anonymously. Only the domain name from which you access the Internet, the Internet address and the date and time you access our web sites are logged. Phase One uses this information to analyze trends and to measure the number of visitors to our web sites. However you will not be able to access areas or services that require registration. 

 **Use of personal information**

 Phase One will generally not share your personal information with third parties.

Phase One may use aggregated (not personally identifiable) data collected to inform our sponsors, advertisers and other third parties as to numbers of people who have certain demographic characteristics and the number of those people who have seen and "clicked" on specific pages or advertisement(s). We may also disclose to such third-parties the overall demographics available regarding who saw and "clicked" on advertisements.

 In the event Phase One sells assets (or the assets of a division or subsidiary) to another entity, including, without limitation, in the event of bankruptcy, or if Phase One (or a division or subsidiary) is acquired by, or merged with, another entity, Phase One may provide to such entity customer and visitor information (both aggregate and personally identifiable) that is related to that part of the business that was sold to or merged with the other entity.

**Links to other sites**

 Our website may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Phase One is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third party websites as well as any information they might collect, even though our name or logo may appear on those sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the Privacy Statements of each and every Web site that you visit, as the privacy policy of those sites may differ from ours. 

  **Use of “cookies”**

 During your visit to our website, so-called “cookies” are saved to your computer. These “cookies” register information about the navigation of your computer on our website (loaded pages, date, time of day and length of visit etc.) which we can access during your next visit in order to adapt the website to your personal requirements and optimize loading times. We also use this information to enter your data into enquiry forms and suchlike so that you do not need to fill them in yourself again and again.  
We never store passwords or similarly sensitive data in cookies.  
The use of cookies is common and advantageous. By indicating how and when visitors use a website, cookies aid us in finding out which areas are popular and which areas are not. Many improvements and updates are based on information supplied by cookies. Cookies can also help us to personalize web content and meet the desires of our visitors.  
Our websites do not use cookies to collect personal information from your computer that was not initially sent as a cookie.  
You have the option to control the acceptance of cookies yourself and, if you wish, to block them entirely by configuring your Internet browser. Please refer to the documentation for your browser to change your preferences for this.

 We reserve the right, at any time and without notice, to add, to change, update or modify this Privacy Statement, simply by posting such change, update or modification on the web site. Any such change, update or modification will be effective immediately upon posting on the web site.
