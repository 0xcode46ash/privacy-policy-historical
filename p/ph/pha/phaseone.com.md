# Privacy

Phase One collects information about users and usage in two separate venues: in the Capture One application, and on our websites.

## Capture One 8 

#### The information Phase One collects

Capture One collects usage information to help us improve our products. This information is completely anonymous, and do not include any personal information, such as name, email address or customer ID. Information is collected unobtrusively without the user being asked to supply information manually.

The collected information can be grouped in two kinds of information: demographic data and usage behavior. Demographic data is collected automatically and users are invited to participate or not when launching the application.

Demographic data include:  


  * The country where the software is running 
  * Software application version number 
  * Platform information such as operating system and graphics card, memory size, Camera ID and Lens Usage



Usage information includes: 

  * How often different features are used 
  * How often different buttons and menu items are clicked 
  * Execution time for specific operations 
  * Error reports



We use the service Telerik Analytics to collect, store and display this information.  


#### Use of personal information

The information helps us evolve our efforts within software development, such as developing new features, debugging, and general user experience improvements. The information is not shared with third parties.  


#### Data protection  


Phase One uses the service Telerik Analytics to collect, store and display the collected information (“Data”). Telerik will not review, share, distribute, or reference any Data. Telerik has implemented security measures to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the Data under our control. Telerik Analytics is hosted in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technologies to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. Telerik provides unique user names and passwords that must be entered each time a customer logs on. These safeguards help prevent access that is unauthorized, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of Data.  
 

## Websites 

#### The information Phase One collects

We will ask you when we need information identifying you ("personal information") and allows us to contact you. Generally this information is requested when you want to purchase our products, when you want to request a product demo, when you register for our newsletter, when you want to download our software, when you have support requests or when you want to be notified on updates and news for your products.

When you register, we may ask you for information such as your name, e-mail address, shipping address, and product information (such as license code, serial number, make and model).

Your IP address is used to help identifying you and your time spent at our sites, and to gather broad demographic information. This allows us to see which parts of our sites users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable.

When a user submits personal information, it is kept on an internal server at Phase One, not accessible from the internet. This limits the risk of any malicious use of your information.

You can change or correct registered information for your Phase One profile online at our website. If you experience problems submitting such changes you can contact Phase One support via our website.  
If you have registered information with us, about products you use or own, you can modify or delete these registrations online via our website or via the latest Capture One software.

If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still use most of our website anonymously. Only the domain name from which you access the internet, the internet address and the date and time you access our websites are logged. Phase One uses this information to analyze trends and to measure the number of visitors to our websites. However you will not be able to access areas or services that require registration.

#### Use of personal information

If you have chosen to receive news from Phase One and its authorized partners, Phase One will share your contact details with such partners. Other than that, Phase One will generally not share your personal information with third parties.

Phase One may use aggregated (not personally identifiable) data collected to inform our sponsors, advertisers and other third parties as to numbers of people who have certain demographic characteristics, and the number of those people who have seen and "clicked" on specific pages or advertisement(s). We may also disclose to such third-parties the overall demographics available regarding who saw and "clicked" on advertisements.

In the event Phase One sells assets (or the assets of a division or subsidiary) to another entity, including without limitation, in the event of bankruptcy or if Phase One (or a division or subsidiary) is acquired by, or merged with, another entity, Phase One may provide to such entity customer and visitor information (both aggregate and personally identifiable) that is related to that part of the business that was sold to or merged with the other entity.

#### Links to other sites

Our website may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Phase One is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third party websites as well as any information they might collect, even though our name or logo may appear on those sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the Privacy Statements of each and every Web site that you visit, as the privacy policy of those sites may differ from ours.
