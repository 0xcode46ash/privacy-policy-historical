#### How we use your information

We use your information as required to fulfil your orders, to provide you with a better shopping experience and, with your permission, to keep you updated with new products, offers and exclusives.

We may use your information in the following ways:

1\. For the performance of our services, or where we have a legitimate interest, for example:

  * for the administration of the site, to ensure that site content is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your device, and to allow you to participate in interactive features when you choose to;
  * for every stage required in the fulfilment of your order



2\. Through your consent to our use of cookies:

  * to remind you that you have items in your basket or that a transaction is incomplete (this is recorded by use of a cookie file, further details about our use of cookies is set out in our [Cookie Policy here](https://web.archive.org/fcp/content/Cookies/content))



3\. If you have consented to receive marketing information from us, we may use your information in the following way:

  * details of transactions you carry out through our website and the fulfilment of your orders will be processed and used to contact you by email with information about goods and services which may be of interest because they are similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale to you (however we never store your payment details);
  * if you have consented for us to do so, we will share your information internally within the TFG Brands (London) group in order to send you tailored offers or other information we believe will be of interest



You have the option to unsubscribe from our e-mails through a link at the bottom of every e-mail we send to you.

If you want to change the details that you have registered on-line with us, or would like to amend your subscription preferences or unsubscribe altogether, this can be changed in the [My Account](https://web.archive.org/pws/secure/ManageAccount.ice) section of our site.

  


#### How we share your information

  * We may share your information with our core service providers and third party platforms as required for our business to function, for example picking, packaging and processing orders, fulfilling deliveries, customer support, fraud detection, credit risk reduction checks, IT systems support, marketers providing direct mail services, and internal audits.
  * We share your information with Feefo, a third party feedback site who will capture your feedback on transactions which we use to enhance our customer service.
  * Your information may be processed by a third party in order to maintain the functionality of our website and database. These third parties will only process your information in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 (the “Act”), as amended from time to time.
  * Whilst you are a member of our mailing list we may share your information with non-core service providers, such as marketing partners we have carefully selected to deliver incentives to participate in offers, polls, surveys, analysis or research, all of which assist us in enhancing our services. They are not permitted to use your information after you unsubscribe.
  * We will share your personal information where we are under a legal obligation to do so.



Every external company we work with has a contract with us which clearly sets out our expectations and requirements in handling personal information and obligates them to meet these standards and those contained in the Act. Such companies may only process personal information in line with our instructions.

  


#### How we store your information

The information we collect from you will not be stored outside the European Economic Area. Your information may be processed by our staff or by the staff of our suppliers to the extent necessary to fulfil your order. By submitting your personal information to us, you agree to the transfer of your personal data, its storage and processing.

We will keep the data which we collect from you on a secure server. Any information you give us relating to credit card details is handled by a PCI DSS compliant third party and encrypted using secure server technology. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access and require our suppliers to do the same.

Where we have given you a password (or where you have chosen one) to access certain parts of this site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask that you do not share a password with anyone.

  


#### Sensitive personal information

We do not seek to collect sensitive personal information (i.e. information relating to race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or other beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health, sexual orientation or criminal records).

We recommend that you do not provide such information to us, but to the extent you choose to do so this will mean that you have given explicit consent (and we have accepted) for us to use the information for the reasons set out in this policy.

  


#### Access to your information

The Act gives you the right to access information held about you and for you to request that changes be made to this information if it is inaccurate or not up-to-date.

Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act. Any access request may be subject to a fee (as amended from time to time) to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.
