Any contact details gathered through press or customer enquiries will not be used for marketing purposes unless otherwise requested by the individual. For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998, the data controller is Phase Eight (Fashion & Designs) Ltd.

##### Cookies

Changes to an European Union directive mean that we are required to ask your permission before storing non-essential cookies on your computer.

A cookie is a small file that's stored on your computer by a website to remember certain information. Cookies can be used for many purposes, and some are essential to the way the website works. Cookies aren't evil.

Some cookies are removed from your computer when you close your browser. These are called 'session cookies'. Others stay on your computer for longer, until they expire after a fixed time. These are called 'persistent cookies', and can be used to store information between your browsing sessions, such as your preferred settings on a website, or the items that you added to your basket on your last visit.

Cookies that are strictly necessary to carry out actions which you've asked the site to do, such as adding items to your basket and checking out, are excluded from the new law. Without these cookies, the checkout process won't work and you won't be able to buy anything. We can use these cookies without explicitly asking your permission. These cookies are session cookies, and are removed when you leave the site and close your browser.

This website uses cookies for the following purposes

  


  * To remember your language and country preferences on the site.
  * To remember what you put in your basket on your last visit, so that we can keep your basket contents for you if you didn't already buy them.
  * To track customer behaviour such as the pages visited on your way through the site, and the rate of basket abandonment. This helps us to improve the site and your browsing experience. This tracking information isn't linked to any of your personal details and doesn't let us identify you as an individual.



Our site also uses some third-party tools such as affiliate marketing, and recommendations and review services. These third-parties may also place cookies on the site.

By continuing to use the site with your current browser settings, you consent to allow this site to use cookies.
