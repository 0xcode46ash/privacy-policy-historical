# Privacy Policy | Phanfare Photo and Video Sharing

| 

**Revised September 28, 2005**

Phanfare maintains two privacy policies: one for _registered users_ who use the Phanfare software and service to share their photos and video, and one for _guests,_ anyone who is not a Phanfare registered user who visits the Phanfare website or a photo and video album created by Phanfare registered user.

### Privacy Policy For Phanfare Registered Users

This policy applies only to registered Phanfare users.

We want you to know what information we collect about you and give you the choice of how that information is shared with others. We call this "notice" and "choice" and it's at the heart of every decision we make around privacy. We also strive to treat our members as we ourselves would like to be treated. 

Our goal in collecting information about you is to provide you with a better product and be a profitable, enduring company. We have structured this policy as a series of questions and answers to make it as clear as possible, and we have chosen a conversational style versus a legal one. If you have any questions about our privacy policy, or suggestions for making it more clear, email us at [privacy-matters@phanfare.com](mailto:privacy-matters@phanfare.com)

  1. What information does Phanfare collect about me?
  2. How is the information that Phanfare collects used?
  3. Does Phanfare share member account information?
  4. Does Phanfare share my email address with third parties for email marketing?
  5. If I am Phanfare member, will I receive spam email?
  6. Does Phanfare contact, market to or advertise to the people who view my online albums?
  7. Does Phanfare collect any information about my interactions with my personal computer when I run the Phanfare Photo application?
  8. How do I deactivate my Phanfare account and do you purge your records of my information?
  9. How do I opt out of receiving communications from Phanfare?
  10. How will Phanfare make me aware of changes to this Privacy Policy?
  11. How does Phanfare secure my personal information?


  1. **What information does Phanfare collect about me?**

**Registration:** When you register for the Phanfare service we collect personal contact information, such as name, address, phone number, and email address. We also collect credit card payment information that is used to bill you for the annual subscription after the initial trial period. 

**System Usage:** When you create albums, we store the digitals images you give us, the album descriptions and other information you enter to customize your albums. We also log certain usage information on our servers as you create and manage your photos and video. 

**Technical Support:** When you request support we collect information about the nature of your problem and we may log additional information about system usage to try to help you.

  2. **How is the information that Phanfare collects used?** We use the system usage information and logged diagnostic information to improve our service. For example, we may look at how often a particular feature is used to determine whether or not to improve the feature or a different feature. We use logged diagnostic information to fix bugs and track down problems. In the course of customer support, we may look at system logs to try to understand what you were doing when you had a problem.

We also look at aggregate demographic information to try to understand who are customers are and to guide product development.

We do not send out marketing email to sell you third party products and we do not accept any advertising.

  3. **Does Phanfare share my member account information?** We do not share your member account information with third parties except as described here. 

**Agents:** We employ agents who provide various services to us and are subject to non-disclosure agreements. In the course of their work for us, such agents may have access to your account information. Examples of possible services for which we might employ agents (not all of which we employ today) would be: sending out postal mail, billing your credit card, or taking care of our computer servers. 

**Business Partners:** Phanfare may disclose your personal information to business partners, but only after you consent. For example, to provide prints of pictures, we will need to send the digital images to a printing service along with your account information (we don't make prints ourselves). We try to choose companies with privacy policies similar to ours. Nevertheless, our business partners have separate privacy and data collection practices. Phanfare has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more information regarding the partner or service and their privacy policies, return to that partner's home page and click on their Privacy Policy link. 

**If Phanfare is Acquired:** Additionally, Phanfare may disclose your personal information to a third party who is a successor in interest, in the event of a merger, reorganization, change of control, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of Phanfare's assets. But we will tell you if that is going to happen and give you the opportunity to quit before it does.

**Legally Compelled Disclosure:** Phanfare may disclose your account information when we believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights. If we believe that you are violating our terms of service, we may disclose your personal information to investigate. We can disclose any personal information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with a violation of the Phanfare Member Agreement, an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability. 

  4. **Does Phanfare share my email address for email marketing?** No, we do not. We hate spam and we guess so do you. Your email address is never sold or otherwise shared with other companies for email marketing. 
  5. **If am Phanfare member, will I receive spam email?** The spammers won't get your email from us. Phanfare is a subscription service, not paid for by advertising or marketing to our customers. We do not share your email with third parties. We do send out a newsletter to keep our members aware of features improvements and news about the company. You can opt out of that newsletter if you like. We still reserve the right to contact you about billing problems, changes in our member agreement and other official Phanfare communications. 
  6. **Does Phanfare contact, market to or advertise to the people who view my online albums?** Absolutely not. We consider the people who view your albums to be your relationships, not ours. We don't contact your friends, try to sell them on the service, require them to sign up for service to view your pictures, or otherwise co-opt your relationships. In fact, since the Phanfare name does not appear on your albums, if you use a custom URL to serve your pictures, your friends would have no easy way of knowing how you put your pictures online. They are your pictures, your private albums. 

But just because we don't tell your friends how you created great looking photo and video albums online does not mean you can't. We hope you will tell your friends about our service and encourage them to join. And we may, from time to time, offer referral bonuses to our members who refer new people who become paying members.

Also, if a person who views your albums happens to be a Phanfare member already, then they are subject to this privacy policy.

  7. **Does Phanfare collect any information about my interactions with my personal computer when I run the Phanfare Photo application?** We do not collect other information about your use of your own computer. Phanfare Photo software makes no attempt to track the overall usage of your computer. The sole reason that Phanfare Photo software is a download, versus a purely over-the-web experience is that we can provide a faster, more efficient and more responsive system for managing your online photo and video albums by running locally on your computer. 
  8. **How do I deactivate my Phanfare account and do you purge your records of my information?** If you want to leave the service, email the support team at [support@phanfare.com](mailto:support@phanfare.com). Once you leave we purge your information from our servers within a few weeks. But, your information will continue to exist in our computer server backup tapes until those tapes are re-used. 
  9. **How do I opt out of receiving communications from Phanfare?** The only types of communications you will receive from us are the newsletter and official emails that enable the service (for example, we might send you email when your account is nearing a limit or if your credit were to be denied). You can't opt out of official emails. You can opt out of our newsletter if you like. Send mail to our support team to do that (Automating opting out is on the list.). 
  10. **How will Phanfare make me aware of changes to this Privacy Policy?** We will send you email and make changes to this web page. 
  11. **How does Phanfare secure my personal information?** Our computer servers are housed in secure facilities with 24 hour supervision. We employ industry standard encryption and firewall software. We encrypt registration passwords and have policies and procedures for ensuring that your information is not compromised. 



### Privacy Policy For Phanfare Guests

This policy applies only to _guests,_ those who are not Phanfare registered users, visiting the Phanfare website, including when viewing photo and video albums created by Phanfare registered users.

We consider the people who view albums to be the relationships of our customers, not our relationship. Hence, we do not market our services to album viewers, show album viewers advertisements or attempt to directly solicit viewers to buy the Phanfare service while they are viewing user albums. We collect very little information on who people view albums. We do use browser cookies to implement our password protection. We do keep logs of access, but those logs are anonymous.
