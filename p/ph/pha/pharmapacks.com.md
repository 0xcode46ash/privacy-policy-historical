**Personally Identifiable Information We Collect**

We collect personal information in different ways, for different reasons. General info (e.g. name, address, e-mail, phone number) is collected for the purpose of order fulfillment and if need be, follow up to ensure a satisfactory customer experience. Information associated with a state or federally issued ID is collected and stored to monitor the sale (and amount) of Ephederine, Pseudoephederine and Phenylpropanolamine to an individual customer in a specific time frame. Personal health conditions and/or allergies of a specific customer are gathered to ensure a proper drug therapy utilization review.

**How We Use Your Personally Identifiable Information**

The site uses the information collected to bill you for, and deliver ordered products in the amount of time expected by the customer, per our shipping terms. We will also use the information we collect to contact you in the event there is an issue with your order, or if you request information or support from us.
