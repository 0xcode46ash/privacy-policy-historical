## 1 COLLECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION

Our Policy conforms with your statutory rights under the Data Protection Act 1998. It is very important for us to safeguard your privacy while also providing a personalised and valuable service. We collect the following personal information from you throughout the Site:

  * the information you submit when you register to use the Site, store a Curriculum Vitae or resumé (“CV”) for the purpose of job applications or upload a CV to our CV database (“Database”);
  * the information you submit when you complete a voluntary questionnaire; 
  * if you are an employer, information about the transactions you undertake including details of payment cards used; and
  * automatically retrieved information, such as information about your browsing patterns on the Site (please also see the section below relating to cookies).



We recommend that you don’t submit sensitive personal information to the Site, such as information about:

  * your racial or ethnic origin;
  * your political opinions;
  * your religious beliefs;
  * whether you are a member of a trade union;
  * you physical or mental health or condition;
  * your sexual life; or
  * any offences you have committed or are alleged to have committed.



If you do choose to submit sensitive personal information to the Site, you authorise us to retain and use it in accordance with this Policy.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and would like to know your options in relation to�not having this information used by these companies, [click here.](http://www.google.co.uk/privacy_ads.html)

## 2 USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

The personal information collected throughout the Site is used by us to satisfy the expectations and requirements of our users, for instance as part of a job application. We also use it to administer user registrations, respond to your queries about the Site and operate and improve the Site.

The automatically retrieved information is only used in aggregate form and no individual will be identified. The aggregate data allows us to analyse the site traffic and manage our relationship with advertisers and thus provide a more relevant service to our users (please also see the section below relating to cookies).

Email and postal addresses supplied to us allow us to send you important information about changes and improvements to the Site or special announcements which we feel will be of interest to you. Each time you receive a message or mail shot, you have the option to decline to receive further marketing information relating to our activities. 

Through your use of the Site you may submit information to third parties, for example by applying to a job advertised on the Site or by allowing your CV to be searchable by companies looking for candidates to fill roles. We have no control over such third parties and we are not responsible for their use or retention of your personal information. We try to limit access to use of the job advertisement and Database services to paying employers, recruitment professionals, law enforcement and governmental bodies but we cannot guarantee this.

The Site may contain links to other sites which are outside our control and are not covered by this Policy. If you access other sites using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect information from you which will be used by them in accordance with their privacy policy, which may differ from ours.

If you have uploaded a CV and have provided a referee, it is your responsibility to ensure that the referee has consented in writing to having his/her contact details forwarded to any prospective employer and being contacted as a result.

Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process personal data necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Therefore, by browsing this Site and communicating electronically with us, you acknowledge and agree to our processing of personal data in this way.

## 3 RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

We will retain your personal information as long as you are registered to use the service.

If you use the Database service, your jobseeker status affects how the Database will treat your CV in a search. When you are an ‘active’ or ‘passive’ jobseeker your CV will be searchable. However, when you are not your CV will no longer appear in a search. An ‘active’ jobseeker is a person who is looking to transfer for jobs as soon as possible. A ‘passive’ jobseeker is someone not looking to move job but is open to offers.

If you have uploaded a CV you can update or ask us to remove your CV either from the online storage system or the Database at any time. We will retain an archive copy, which is only for our internal audit purposes and will not be passed to any third parties.

## 4 PHARMIWEB ALERTS

The job alert service aims to match your career requirements and preferences with appropriate vacancies as advertised on the Site. Our email alerts, advertising messages and newsletters aim to provide you with relevant news and information. As a user of any of these services, we may contact you by email from time to time to tell you about improvements to the site, or send you relevant messages from our sponsors or clients. We will only send you advertising messages or relevant messages from our sponsors or clients if you have signed up to the relevant alert service and you can unsubscribe at any time from any of your alerts [by sending us an email at the address below or by clicking on the link at the bottom of the alerts] . Advertising messages may contain promotional content relating to products and/or services from pharmaceutical and biotech companies.
