# The Chronicle of Philanthropy: Privacy statement

### Privacy Statement

_The Chronicle_ is committed to protecting the privacy of its subscribers and other users of its on-line services. We follow these policies:

**E-mail addresses**

We ask subscribers who register for our on-line services to provide us with their e-mail addresses so we can send them news briefings and account information. We also ask for e-mail addresses from people who want to receive our free e-mail updates.

Those addresses are used only to send news updates and account information to those subscribers. **_The Chronicle_ never sells, rents, or lends e-mail addresses of users to anyone.**

Registered subscribers can change the e-mail messages that they receive, or stop receiving them altogether, at any time by visiting our [e-mail settings page.](https://web.archive.org/pcgi-bin/circulation/users/mailinglistreset1.cgi)

Instructions for stopping the free e-mail news updates appear at the end of each e-mail message.

E-mail addresses that we collect as part of our "e-mail this article" service are used only to provide that service. We do not share them with anyone or use them for any other purpose.

**Advertising**

_The Chronicle_ has a contract with an outside company, DoubleClick Inc., to use its technology to deliver ads on our site. This allows us to deliver ads to users according to such factors as domain name and editorial content.

_The Chronicle_ is not a member of the DoubleClick Network. Our agreement with DoubleClick specifies that information about our users may only be used to deliver ads on our site and may not be aggregated with other information collected by DoubleClick. **We do not provide any personal information, such as names, postal addresses, phone numbers, or e-mail addresses, to DoubleClick.** The only information DoubleClick receives is what is automatically passed by a Web browser, such as Internet Protocol number, domain name, and browser type.

_The Chronicle_ sometimes rents its postal mailing list (but never e-mail addresses) to organizations that wish to offer products and services to its subscribers.
