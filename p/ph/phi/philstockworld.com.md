[LDK](http://www.interactivebrokers.com/php/graphs.php?symb=LDK) – Shares in LDK Solar, the China-based maker of multicrystalline silicon wafers used the production of solar cells, cannonballed 26% to read $48.71 this afternoon after a single analyst downgraded the stock to sell, citing a tighter outlook for the company's margins owing to higher silicon costs. Options in LDK, which for weeks now have been a marquee feature on our volume and volatility screens, traded on a volume of more than 84,000 lots this afternoon – measuring up to 40% of its total open interest and reflecting its highest level of call volume on record. While twice as many calls are represented in today's overall volume, traders appear to be making fresh bets on volatile price action persisting into the eleventh hour of LDK's December contract. They're doing this th

**Fixed Percentages**

When to sell?  When trading stocks the answer is often not that challenging.  As a longer term investor all you need do is glance at stock ranking services such as Zack's, Investools or Investor's Business Daily to note how few fundamentally attractive stocks exist relative to mediocre or unattractive stocks.  Once a stock is overvalued - and various measures (e.g. PEG > 2.0) indicate when that is the case -then it is time to sell. 

But determining when to exit an options trade can be an altogether different game.  When should you sell a put option, when should you sell a call options or exit a calendar spread.  How does your exit change when trading a bull call spread versus a ratio call backspread? What happens when an event is coming up?

When I first sought the answer I used hear generic rules thrown about such as "Always exit when yo [more from options sage](https://web.archive.org/author/optionsage)
