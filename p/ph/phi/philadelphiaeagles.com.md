**Web Site Privacy Policy**

Last Updated: December 8, 2011

This is the Privacy Policy for PhiladelphiaEagles.com and LincolnFinancialField.com, as well as Philadelphia Eagles’ various social networking profiles, operated by Philadelphia Eagles LLC (collectively, the "Website").  (However, this Privacy Policy does not apply to PhiladelphiaEagles.com/Kids, which has its own posted privacy policy.) 

We know your privacy is important to you, and we want you to know that it is important to us, too.  This Policy describes the kinds of information we may collect, how we may collect it, with whom we may share it, and the choices you have regarding our collection, use, and disclosure of this information.  By visiting our Website, you agree to the terms of this Policy as they may be amended from time to time.

Here are a few general principles to keep in mind as you read through this Policy:

  * This Policy may change as our business evolves, so check back to this page periodically to make sure you understand how your information will be treated.
  * This Policy is incorporated into, and part of, our [Terms of Use](http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/footer/terms-and-conditions.html), which govern your use of the Website as a whole.
  * This Policy does not apply to information that you may provide to us, or that we may obtain, other than through our Website, such as at our stadiums and live events.
  * This Website complies with EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.
  * **With your consent on a one-time basis, we may share your Personal Information with third parties for their marketing purposes.   **
  * **If you are located outside of the United States, you should know that the information you provide to us is being transmitted to us and processed in the United States and will be protected subject to this privacy policy and United States laws, which may not be as protective as the laws in your country.   Also, this Site places cookies on your computer or device which are further described below.  By using the Site, you agree to this.**



We are a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program, which covers our PhiladelphiaEagles.com and LincolnFinancialField.com sites but not our social networking profiles or downloadable applications.  TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build user's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices.  In addition to helping us with this Policy, TRUSTe is there to help you obtain answers to your questions or concerns about this Policy or our privacy practices.  If you attempt to contact us at webteam@philadelphiaeagles.com, and we do not acknowledge your inquiry or satisfactorily address your concerns, you should contact TRUSTe at http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php.  TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison to resolve your concerns.

_User Provided Information_

“Personal Information” is information that can be used to identify you as an individual or allow someone to contact you.  When other information, such as a favorite team or player, is associated with personal information, it also becomes personally identifiable information for purposes of this Policy.  We collect Personal Information such as your full name, telephone number, street address, email address, unique identifiers (like your Message Board User ID and password), demographic information (like your date of birth, age, gender, ticket holder status, game attendance, marital status, or number of children), and financial information (like your credit or debit card number) in various ways and for various reasons.  For example, we collect Personal Information when you sign up for our newsletters, register for an account on our Website, create account recovery credentials, register to play games on the Website, make online purchases, enter sweepstakes and contests, complete surveys or voting polls, contribute to a social forum on the Website, or submit a comment or question to us using a “contact us” or similar feature on the Website.

The “Tell-A-Friend” tool provided on the Website and/or in our e-mails allows you to send information about us to your friends and family members.  When you use this tool, we will ask you for your friend's or family member’s name and email address.  We will then use this information to automatically send your friend or family member an email inviting him or her to visit the Website.

_Website Usage Information_

As is the case with many Web sites, our servers automatically collect your IP address when you visit the Website.  We may also capture certain “clickstream data” pertaining to your Website usage.  Clickstream data includes, for example, information about your Web browser and operating system and their settings, the referring page that linked you to the Website, the pages or ads you see or click on during your visit and when and for how long you do so, the next Web site you visit when you leave the Website, and any search terms you have entered on the Website or a referral site. 

In addition, we and our third party partners may deploy various tracking technologies on the Website to collect additional information about your Website visits.  For example:

  * Cookies are small data files stored on your computer or device at the request of a Web site.  A cookie may enable us to relate your use of the Website to other information about you.  Cookies may also be used to enhance your experience on the Website (for example, by storing your MemberID and/or password for the online store) or to collect general usage and aggregated statistical information.  Most browsers can be set to detect cookies and give you an opportunity to reject them, but refusing cookies may, in some cases, inhibit or preclude your use of the Website or its features.  To learn more about the use of cookies, including how to manage or delete them, click here.
  * HTML5 (the language some Web sites are coded in) may be used to store information on your computer or device about your site usage activities.  This information can be retrieved by us to determine how our Website is being used by our visitors, how it can be improved, and to customize it for our users.
  * A pixel tag (also known as a “clear GIF” or “web beacon”) is a tiny image – typically just one-pixel – that can be placed on a Web page or in our electronic communications to you in order to help us measure the effectiveness of our content by, for example, counting the number of individuals who visit us online or verifying whether you’ve opened one of our emails or seen one of our Web pages.
  * Email Communications: When you open emails from us, we may receive a confirmation noting you opened the email, if your computer supports such capabilities. We also may keep track of what emails we send you and what emails you may be receiving from our subsidiaries and affiliates. Additionally, we keep a record of what communications you have opted to receive or not to receive.



These tracking technologies may be deployed by us and/or by our partners on our behalf. These technologies may enable us to relate your Website Usage Information to other information about you, including your Personal Information.

**By using our Website, you agree to our use of tracking technologies through our Website.**

_Social Networking_

We maintain presence on several social networking platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, and we also incorporate some of their features onto our Website, such as Facebook’s “Like It”.  Through these platforms and features, we receive some Personal Information and some usage information about you, and this Privacy Policy applies to that information as well.  In addition, third party social networking platforms have their own privacy policies which explain how the third parties that provide them will use and protect your information.

_Information Obtained from Third Parties_

We may supplement the Personal Information we collect from you with information that we obtain from third parties, such as our partners in sponsored content sections, our affiliates with whom you have previously done business, and data aggregators.  The information we obtain from third parties may include, but is not limited to, things like your contact information, preferences, and demographic information.

As applicable, we or one of our trusted partners may use the information we collect from and about you to:

  * contact you about the Website or your membership status;
  * respond to your requests, questions, and concerns;
  * confirm or fulfill an order you have made;
  * inform you of a prize you have won and deliver it to you;
  * monitor or improve the use of the Website;
  * develop new features and offerings on the Website;
  * customize the advertising and content you see;
  * monitor compliance with our terms and conditions of use of the Website;
  * assess the level of interest in, and use of, the Website, our e-mails, and our other messaging campaigns both on an individual basis and in the aggregate; and
  * send you our promotional material and special offers and those of third parties.



To perform the above functions, we may match information collected from you through different means or at different times, including both Personal Information and Website Usage Information, and use such information along with information obtained from other sources (including third parties) such as demographic information and updated contact information. 

We may share your personal information with others for various purposes. In addition to the kinds of information sharing you might expect, such as sharing with third parties who need your information in order to provide services to us (or on our behalf) and sharing what you voluntarily post to public areas on the Website with other Website users, we may share your information:

  * with the public if you win a contest or sweepstakes, but subject to the terms and conditions of such contest or sweepstakes, and not without your consent unless the law requires us to;
  * subject to your consent on a one-time basis, with third parties for their own marketing purposes;
  * subject to your consent, with our sponsor(s) if we obtain your information in connection with a contest, sweepstakes or other promotional activity that is offered by a third party or jointly offered by us and any third parties;
  * when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or property, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud or respond to a government, judicial or other legal request; and
  * in connection with a corporate change including a merger, acquisition, reorganization, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, bankruptcy or sale of assets.



In addition, we may share Website Usage Information and other non-personally identifiable information about our users and user behavior with our marketing partners, affiliates, and other third parties.

If you do not want us to send you our marketing emails, you may let us know by clicking on the appropriate link within the email you receive, changing your preferences at the [preferences center of our Website] [insert link], or by sending an email to webteam@philadelphiaeagles.com with the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject line.  To opt out of our SMS messages, please text STOP to 82565.

Please understand the following with respect to your request to opt out of having your information shared or receiving further promotional communications:

  * it may take us a few days to process your request
  * to stop receiving communications from a third party with whom we have already shared your Personal Information, you must contact that third party directly
  * even if you opt out of receiving promotional correspondence from us, we may still contact you in connection with your relationship, activities, transactions and communications with us.



You should be aware that when you are on the Website you could be directed to other Web sites that are beyond our control, including through links from advertisers, sponsors and marketing partners that may use the Website's logo as part of a co-branding agreement.  For example, if you click on a banner advertisement, your click may take you to a third party’s Web site.  These other Websites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies.  If you visit a Web site that is linked to our Website, you should become comfortable with that Web site's privacy policies and practices before providing any Personal Information.

This Website incorporates reasonable safeguards to protect the security, integrity, completeness, accuracy and privacy of the Personal Information that we may collect and we have put into place reasonable precautions to protect such information from loss, misuse and alteration.  Your sensitive personally identifiable information is transferred to our computers utilizing encryption software.  However, do not send us sensitive Personal Information by email or a “contact us” feature on our Website since these transmissions may not be secure.  Only those employees who need access to your sensitive information in order to do their jobs are allowed access.  Our security policies are reviewed periodically and revised as required.

If we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our care may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development.  If a notification is appropriate, we will endeavor to notify you as promptly as possible under the circumstances.  If we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail.  **You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification.**   **If you prefer for us to use the U.S. Postal Service to notify you in this situation, please e-mail us at** **webteam@philadelphiaeagles.com**. **.**

The Website is intended for a general audience.  We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of thirteen (13) on the Website.  For information about the privacy practices for our affiliated children's Web site, such as "PhiladelphiaEagles.com/Kids", please visit our Kids Club privacy policy.

You may review, update or modify certain of the Personal Information that is stored in your user account on the Website (such as your email address or zip code) by logging in to the “My Account” area of the Website or by sending an email to webteam@philadelphiaeagles.com.  If you send us requests via email, we may ask you to verify your identity and to provide other details before we are able to provide you with any information or correct any inaccuracies.  In any event, we will respond to your request within 20 business days. 

You may also be able to delete some of your Personal Information or deactivate your profile using the means described above.  Please note, however, that your right to delete your information is subject to our records retention practices through which we keep your information for as long as we need it to provide services to you and as necessary to comply with applicable legal requirements, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

You may request removal of your Personal Information from our publicly accessible blogs or community forums by sending an email to webteam@philadelphiaeagles.com.  But please be aware that in some cases we may not be able to remove your Personal Information despite your request.

We may change this Policy from time to time.  When we do, we will let you know by posting the changed Policy on this page with a new “Last Updated” date.  In some cases (for example, if we make a material change to the way in which we collect, use, and/or share your Personal Information), we may also tell you about changes by additional means, such as by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address we have on file for you, and we may ask for your consent to the change.  Please note that you should always update your personal information to provide us with a current email address.
