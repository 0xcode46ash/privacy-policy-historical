### Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms

We and our third party service providers may use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Site or Services.  We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our third party service providers may do so on our behalf).

Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests.  You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies); you also may opt-out of targeted advertising by following the instructions in the Third Party Ad Network section.

**Cookies.**   Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes.  Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site and Service.  There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.

  * **Session Cookies.** Session cookies exist only during an online session.  They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer.  We may use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site.  This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.
  * **Persistent Cookies.** Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer.  We may use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, and to display advertising both on our Site and on third-party sites.



**Disabling Cookies.**  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future.  The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.  Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.

### Local Storage Objects.

We may use Flash Local Storage Objects (“Flash LSOs”) to store your Site preferences and to personalize your visit.  Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored.  Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser.  For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose “Global Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions.  To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose “Website Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.

### Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.

Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages.  We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage.  We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.

### Third Party Analytics.

We may use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Site and, to the extent permitted, our Application. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Services.  We use these tools to help us improve our Services, performance and user experiences.  These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services.  We do not share your personal information with these third parties.

### Third-Party Ad Networks

We may use third parties such as network advertisers to display advertisements on our Site, to assist us in displaying advertisements on third party websites, and to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns.  Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Site as well as other websites.  This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested.  Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you.  These third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one.  We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Site and our services, as well as aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Site and users of our service.

You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”).  For more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to opt-out of third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective websites: www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp (NAI) and www.aboutads.info/choices (DAA).

Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you.  It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Site or other websites.  You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing.  Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective.  Additional information is available on NAI’s and DAA’s websites accessible by the above links.

### Third-Party Links

Our Site and Services may contain links to third-party websites.  Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third party websites.  We are not responsible for the information practices of such third party websites.

### Security of My Personal Information

We have implemented commercially reasonable precautions to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.  Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.

You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private.  We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.

### Access To My Personal Information

You may modify personal information that you have submitted by logging into your account and updating your profile information.  Please note that copies of information that you have updated, modified or deleted may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Site for a period of time.

### What Choices Do I Have Regarding Use of My Personal Information?

We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to you.  You may opt-out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the email.  Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests.  If you opt-out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you emails about your account or any Services you have requested or received from us.

### Children Under 13

Our Services are not designed for children under 13.  If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete such information from our systems.

### Your California Privacy Rights

California residents may request a list of certain third parties to which we have disclosed personally identifiable information about you for their own direct marketing purposes.  You may make one request per calendar year.  In your request, please attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for your response.  You may request this information in writing by contacting us at:  [info@philanthropyu.org](mailto:info@philanthropyu.org) .  Please allow up to thirty (30) days for a response.

### Changes to this Policy

This Policy is current as of the Effective Date set forth above.  We may change this Policy from time to time, so please be sure to check back periodically.  We will post any changes to this Policy on our Site, at <http://philanthropyu.org/privacy-policy>.  If we make any changes to this Policy that materially affect our practices with regard to the personal information we have previously collected from you, we will endeavor to provide you with notice in advance of such change by highlighting the change on our Site.
