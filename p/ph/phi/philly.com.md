**Will philly.com disclose any of my personal information?**   
philly.com will disclose personal information in some limited circumstances. When philly.com intends to disclose information, the purpose will be explained to you beforehand:  
\- From time to time, philly.com will run sweepstakes or promotions for Registration holders. In most cases, you will be required to provide additional information on in order to participate in the event, and some of this data may be provided to the sponsor of the promotion.

Also, you will not be signed up without your express consent.  
\- philly.com does disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. However, aggregate data is not traceable to a specific user.  
\- When philly.com decides to integrate 3rd party services which depend upon customer information, such as online email or personalized stock quotes, we may share some elements of our customer records (such as an email address) with the third party. Such partners, as well as Internet sites and services accessible through philly.com, may have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of philly.com. It is our policy to notify you of any differences between their policies and our own. However, philly.com has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or the actions of non-affiliated third parties.

**Will philly.com use my information for direct mailings?**   
Yes, unless you request that we donâ€™t. The registration form for the philly.com site provides you with the opportunity to opt-out of mailings. If you opt-out, then we will not send you anything.

**Does philly.com use Cookies and IP Addresses?**   
Yes. Philly.com stores a scrambled version of your Registration username in a permanent "Cookie" file on your hard drive so that we can remember who you are from one visit to the next, if you login through "Automatic Login". If you do not choose "Automatic Login", we will use a temporary Cookie after you log in (which expires after each visit) to keep track of you as you move from page to page during a given visit to our site. With these Cookies, we will be able to provide you with an increased level of personalized service and/or to target advertising. In addition, some of our sites and advertising systems may set additional cookies which contain no personal information whatsoever. 

When philly.com begins using Cookies, it will store all your registration data in your Cookie. To protect your privacy, each cookie will be scrambled using a proprietary encryption algorithm. Think of these Cookies as "claim checks". Like a coat room clerk, we will use the Cookie to help us keep track of your information on our systems. To anyone other than us, the information stored in your Cookies is meaningless. 

You might wonder if another Web site or online user would be able to steal your Registration username from your cookie? The answer is no. Only philly.com and affiliated sites can read the information about your Registration Username. Due to the design of Web servers and browsers, no other Web site has access to your philly.com Cookie and vice versa. However, if you have chosen Automatic Login, anyone who sits down at your computer can log on to the site using your Registration information. 

philly.com may also collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.
