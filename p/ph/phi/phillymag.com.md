We request this information when you [subscribe](https://commerce.cdsfulfillment.com/PHI/subscriptions.cgi) to Philadelphia Magazine or an affiliated publication, sign-up for and use a chat, club, message board, or forum (collectively, a "Forum"), or otherwise contact Philadelphia Magazine. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

We reserve the right to share both aggregate and personal information collected from you with third parties if we are authorized to do so, if the law requires it, to protect the rights of Philadelphia Magazine, or as part of a sale or other disposition of our assets (including our membership and/or customer records). We may also use and disclose Personal Information to prevent or trace abuses of the Site, including but not limited to use of a Forum.

If you make a purchase on our Site, including a subscription for a magazine, we will typically ask for your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, credit card number, and the expiration date. If the product or subscription is provided or shipped by a third party, we will pass on to the third party the information needed to fulfill your order.

**Promotions and Contests**

Philadelphia Magazine may from time to time sponsor sweepstakes, contests, or other events ("Promotions") which require the collection, processing, and storage of individual contact information plus demographic information. These Promotions may also ask registrants to answer survey questions. Any personally identifiable information collected through promotions will be treated as "Personal Information," as defined above. No purchase is ever necessary to enter a Philadelphia Magazine Promotion. Please see the official rules of each Promotion for more information.

Philadelphia Magazine may co-sponsor Promotions with other companies, in which case any information collected is likely to be shared with other participating sponsors, who may use this information as they wish. A registrant's personal contact and demographic information will not be released to any third-party organization other than named sponsors without the registrant's consent.
