# PhysioNet Privacy Policy

**Your privacy is important to us.** We do not collect personally identifiable information on our web site or otherwise unless you choose to give it to us via an electronic mail message, a phone call, or by postal mail. Even when you choose to give us such information, we keep it confidential. 

We do not sell, rent, share, or otherwise disclose mailing lists or other personally identifiable information. We maintain some records of individuals who contact us so that we may contact you later or provide further information to you in the future. We do not provide this information to anyone else unless you give us your permission. 

We do not use "cookies" on our web site. Our web servers collect information about dates and times when our web site was accessed, the IP addresses and host names of the computers that connect to our site, and the URLs of the web sites from which you linked to our site. We may use this information in summary form, stripped of personally identifiable information, to analyze web traffic and to document usage of this resource to funding agencies. 

You may register as a member of PhysioNet if you use PhysioBank data or PhysioToolkit software, or if you wish to contribute data, software, or commentary to the PhysioNet web site. The information you submit with your registration is entered into the PhysioNet membership database. The PhysioNet membership database is never sold, rented, lent, exchanged, or used for anything other than official PhysioNet activity. We may elect to send members mailings with information from other groups, but the mailings will always originate with PhysioNet. 

Members may post data, software, and commentary via PhysioNet, but all such postings are identified by the member's e-mail address (at a minimum; you may of course include other identifying information, such as a PGP signature, if you wish). 

Our privacy policy is based on those adopted by [Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility](http://www.cpsr.org/) and by the [Privacy Rights Clearinghouse](http://www.privacyrights.org/). This is a [P3P-enabled](http://www.w3.org/P3P/) web site. If you are using a P3P-enabled web browser, it should be able to fetch our P3P policy automatically. If not, here are our [P3P policy](https://web.archive.org/w3c/policy1.xml) and [P3P policy reference](https://web.archive.org/w3c/p3p.xml) files. 

Your comments and suggestions are welcome. We encourage you to use our [feedback form](http://physionet.org/cgi-bin/feedback) to comment on this page. If you would like to receive a reply, please send your comments by email to [ `webmaster@physionet.org`](mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=http://physionet.org/privacy.shtml), or post them to:
