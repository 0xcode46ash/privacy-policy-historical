### Registration

To receive and/or access some services, users have to complete a registration form. During registration, a user is required to give contact information (such as name and e-mail address). This information may be used to contact the user about the services for which they have expressed interest and also about other goods, services and features that IOP believes the user will find interesting. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information and unique identifiers, but it is encouraged so that IOP can provide a more personalized experience. If a user chooses not to provide such information then they will not be able to access parts of this website and/or will not be able to use all of the services offered by this website. A user may contact IOP about use of their personal information, edit it on this website and/or tell IOP not to use it in certain ways by e-mailing [data.protection@iop.org](mailto:data.protection@iop.org).

### Cookies

A cookie is a small text file written to a user's hard drive and does not contain any personally identifiable information. The use of cookies is now widespread. The reason that IOP uses cookies is to save its users time on this website (so that they do not have to log in more than once) and also so that it can personalize a user's experience of this website. If a user sets up their browser to reject the cookie, they may still use this website, although functionality will be impaired. 

### Log Files

IOP uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer this website, track users' movements and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. 

### Links

This website contains links to third_party websites. IOP is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. It encourages its users to read the privacy statements of these third party websites. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by IOP websites. 

### Surveys and Contests

From time-to-time this website may request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose any information requested.

Survey information will be used for the purposes of monitoring or improving the functionality of this website.

This can usually be done by the user within any personalization options of this website or by sending an e-mail to [custserv@iop.org](mailto:custserv.iop.org). 

### Notification of Changes

If IOP decides to change its Privacy Policy, it will make the updated version available via this website so that its users are always aware of what information it collects, how it uses it and under what circumstances, if any, it discloses it. If at any point it decides to use personal data in a manner different from that stated at the time when they were collected, it will notify users. Users will have a choice as to whether or not IOP uses their information in this different manner. IOP will use information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected.
