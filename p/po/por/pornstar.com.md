## Privacy & Security Policy 

Please take a minute to read the following policy so you understand how we use the personal information we ask you to submit. As we update and expand our services, this policy may change, so please refer back to it periodically. If you use any of services provided by pornstar.com, you agree to these terms and conditions. 

**Background**  
When you register at pornstar.com, we ask you for your personal information. We use this information to process your orders and to communicate with you about the status of your orders. We may also use your e-mail address to send you messages about special offers being made available by pornstar.com, promotional announcements and/or consumer surveys. If you no longer want to receive e-mails containing promotional announcements and/or consumer surveys, simply reply to the e-mail and request to be unsubscribed. 

**Collection and Use of Information**   
When you first register at pornstar.com, we ask you for your e-mail address, your telephone number, and that you create a password. We then ask you for you full name, physical address, so we can correctly ship your order to you. We use your telephone number only if there is an order-related issue, not for marketing purposes. We will never rent or sell your name, address, email address, or personal information to any third party without your permission. 

You must certify that you are at least 18 years old. All individuals under eighteen (18) years of age are strictly prohibited from using the services provided by pornstar.com. Our server stores this information so that placing future orders will be quicker and easier. If you want to update your address go to your Account page and make the appropriate changes. You must be logged in with pornstar.com to access your Account page. We also track your order and billing history so you can access Your Account and immediately determine which DVDs you've rented and how you paid for them. This information is also used to remove rented titles from your wish list. 

**E-mail Options**   
When registering at pornstar.com, we may subscribe you to various e-mail publications. You can find more information on these programs, including information on how to unsubscribe, by going to the pornstar.com Account Page. 

Viewing and Updating Your Information on pornstar.com   
You can always access the personal information you have provided to pornstar.com by clicking on Account at the top of the page. You can make changes to this information to update your account anytime. 

**Cookies**   
As you browse the pornstar.com site, cookies are placed on your computer's hard drive. (Cookies are small pieces of data that are sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your hard drive.) Cookies allow us to track the items you select, and help us match your address information with your order so you don't need to retype the information each time you visit our site. 

If your browser is set to not accept cookies, you will not be able to use the pornstar.com site or service. 

We also use cookies to gather usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to our site and its various pages. Third parties may serve some of these cookies. We analyze this data to determine which parts of our site customers like and which parts need improvement. Automatically logged information is also used to analyze trends and to administer the site. 

**Disclosure**   
Except as described in this section, we will not sell, rent or disclose your personally identifying information to third parties without notifying you of our intent to share the information and giving you an opportunity to prevent your information from being shared. 

We occasionally use other companies, agents or contractors to perform services necessary to our operations. For example, we have partnered with other companies to personalize our Web pages, analyze customers' interaction with our site and process consumer surveys. We also provide postal addresses to the U.S. Postal Service for mail delivery purposes. In the course of providing such services, these companies may have contact with your personally identifying information. By contractual agreement, these companies must treat your information in accordance with this Policy. We will not be liable for any damages that may result from the misuse of your personal information by these companies. 

From time to time, we may partner with companies whose products we believe will interest our users. In conjunction with these partners, we occasionally send promotional announcements to particular customers. We do not automatically include our users in any particular marketing promotion; instead, we use a variety of factors, including user activity at the pornstar.com site, to determine the appropriate users. You can go to the pornstar.com Account Page and request that your name be excluded from these mailings with our marketing partners. We may use a vendor to carry out these mailings. However, the partner company never sees your e-mail address or any other information that could identify you or be used to contact you directly. 

Any exceptions to this policy of sharing your name, address or e-mail address with a partner company will be done only with your permission. pornstar.com also reserves the right to disclose information when required to do so by law. Customers should check back for updates to this policy. pornstar.com will obtain e-mail consent from any user if the company is going to be using the information collected in a manner different from that stated when the user registered. 

**Security and Access**  
For transmitting your personal information to us, we use a secure server (SSL), which encrypts all of your personal information. This encryption process ensures that the information you give us is protected against unauthorized access. You can access Your Account from every page on the site to update and correct your name, e-mail address, password, postal address, and mailing list preferences. Please note that you must be logged in to pornstar.com to access this information. 

We have implemented technology and security features, as well as strict internal guidelines, to safeguard the privacy of your personal information from unauthorized access or improper use. We will continue to enhance our security procedures as new technology becomes available. While we make every effort to ensure that your information is secure on our system, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. 

**Return Policy**

**Sealed packages:**  
Because we cannot accept returns of products once they have been opened, before opening each product please check its packaging and label carefully to be sure you received the correct product and version.   
If the original packaging and seal is still intact, you may return the product to us within 30 days from purchase for merchandise credit (excluding shipping and handling charges), subject to a 15% restocking fee. Return shipping to us is at your own expense. 

**Defective Returns:**  
If your product is not functioning properly, please email our Customer Support Department at support@pornstar.com as soon as possible (but not later than 30 days from purchase).   
In such case, we will replace the product with an even exchange of the same item, subject to in-stock availability. No toy can be accepted for a return if it has been used. If any item is returned and our inspectors deem that it has been used it will be returned to you at your expense. We stress that you should inspect any item thoroughly before you use the item.   
Replacement items ship the same day the defective item is received and inspected by our Returns Department. All products returned to us must be accompanied by a valid Return Authorization (RA) number issued by us within 30 days of your original invoice date. After 30 days from purchase we can no longer issue an RA. RA's expire in 15 days after they are issued and cannot be extended or re-issued. All returned products must be 100% complete in original packaging. A valid RA number must be written clearly and conspicuously on the outside of the packaging. Incomplete or unauthorized returns will be refused. 

**Contact**  
If you have questions concerning your account, please email Customer Service support@pornstar.com. If you have questions concerning this privacy policy, please contact support@pornstar.com.
