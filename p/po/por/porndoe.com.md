**Cookies** When you first visit PornDoe, PornDoe may send you a cookie. A cookie is a small file that is placed on your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. It helps us to recognise you when you visit the Website and makes use of the Website easier and quicker for you. PornDoe may also use cookies for the compilation of certain statistics relating to the use of a service which does not identify you personally. Such information may include the number of visits, average time spent and other statistics relating to that service. Where we do compile such statistics, we may share this information with our clients and partners, but only in the aggregate, to help them to understand how PornDoe users use areas on the website. These statistics will not include any information which could identify you. 

**Analytics** PornDoe likes to keep track of what pages and links are popular and which ones don't get used so much to help us keep our sites relevant and up to date. It's also very useful to be able to identify trends of how people navigate (find their way through) our sites. This group of cookies, often called 'analytics cookies' are used to gather this information. These cookies don't collect information that identifies you. The information collected is anonymous and is grouped with the information from everyone else’s cookies. PornDoe can then see the overall patterns of usage rather than any one person’s activity. Analytics cookies only record activity on the site you are on and they are only used to improve how a website works. Some of PornDoe´s websites and some of the e-mails you might get from PornDoe also contain small invisible images known as 'web beacons' or 'tracking pixels'. These are used to count the number of times the page or email has been viewed and allows us to measure the effectiveness of its marketing and emails. These web beacons are anonymous and don't contain or collect any information that identifies you. PornDoe also use 'affiliate' cookies. Some of our web pages will contain promotional links to other companies’ sites. If you follow one of these links and then register with or buy something from that other site, a cookie is sometimes used to tell that other site that you came from one of our sites. That other site may then pay PornDoe a small amount for the successful referral. This works using a cookie. **Showing advertising that is relevant to your interests** PornDoe may sell, rent or make available space on some of our sites to advertisers. The resulting adverts often contain cookies. The advertiser uses the browsing information collected from these cookies to: 

  * restrict the number of times you see the same ad (frequency capping); and 
  * help show other ads that are relevant to you while you're on our websites. This is often called online behavioural advertising (OBA). OBA is a way of using information about your web-browsing activity, collected by using cookies, to group you with other users into interest groups and show you advertisements based on those interests. The OBA data collected from cookies you get when you're on our sites is only used to show relevant ads on PornDoe sites, not on other websites. 



Although the OBA data collected uses your browsing activity to understand your interests, the data is anonymous and isn’t linked to you as a person. 

Neither PornDoe, nor the companies who show ads on our sites sell data collected from cookies to any other organizations.   
**Security**   
PornDoe will take all reasonable measures to ensure that data PornDoe holds about you is secure and will inform you as soon as possible if any breach of security results in any unauthorised person accessing your data. 

**Privacy Commitment Changes** If PornDoe decide to change our privacy policy, PornDoe will post those changes here and e-mail (if e-mail is provided) you to let you know the policy has changed so that you will always know what information we gather, how we may use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. 

If you would like more information regarding the processing of your personal data or if you object to the use of your data in any of the ways mentioned here or you object to us contacting you by any of the methods referred to above, then please contact the Data Protection Officer [legal@tubolimited.com](mailto:legal@tubolimited.com).
