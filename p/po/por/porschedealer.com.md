# Internet Privacy Policy - HOME - Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG

Porsche recognizes the importance of protecting the personal privacy of its customers, potential customers and website visitors. This internet privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes the information that may be collected through our websites, the choices you can make about our use of your personal information and how we protect your personal information.

### 

This Privacy Policy applies only to websites operated by or on behalf of Porsche Cars North America, Inc. and only to those websites which provide a direct link to this Privacy Policy (the “Sites”). Unless otherwise indicated, all references to “Porsche,” “we” or “our” in this Privacy Policy shall mean Porsche Cars North America, Inc. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any offline data collection or practices of Porsche Cars North America, Inc. or any other Porsche companies.

Some of the Sites may contain links to the websites of other Porsche companies or to the websites of third parties. Porsche is not responsible and has no liability for the privacy policies or practices of those websites. We recommend that you review the privacy policies of each website you visit.

The Sites are designed for consumers located exclusively in the United States of America. If you are located outside the United States, please return to [www.porsche.com](https://web.archive.org/) and use the drop down box to find the website for users in your location, but please do not use the Sites, as the Sites’ personal information practices and the terms of this Privacy Policy may or may not comply with foreign law.

As used in this Privacy Policy, “personal information” means information that may be used to identify a specific individual, or that is about an identifiable individual, such as name, e-mail address, phone number or credit card number. “Aggregate information” refers to combined demographic information which has been derived from personal information but which cannot be used to identify any individual or that is not about an identifiable individual.

### 

You can visit the Sites and learn about our products and programs without providing personal information. However, to participate in our programs or receive newsletters, you will need to provide personal information. Porsche does not collect any personal information on the Sites unless you provide it voluntarily.

In addition to our General Uses listed below, we use the personal information you provide only for purposes consistent with the reason you provide it, such as:

**Registration / Porsche Travel Club and Other Programs / Webspecials:** At your option, you may register as a Porsche Site user to allow for easy registration for programs through the Porsche Travel Club or our driving schools, access to Webspecials offered only to online users, or other programs offered on the Sites. As part of registration, we collect your name, e-mail address, mailing address and other contact information. We may ask for other information in connection with specific programs (e.g. travel dates for the Travel Club), or more generally about your vehicles or interests in order to better customize your website experience or our offers to you. We indicate at the time of collection which information is mandatory and which information is optional to provide.

**Information Requests:** We may ask you to provide personal information in order to allow us to respond to your requests for information or other requests made over the Sites.

**Purchases of Products and Services:** Where the Sites allow you to purchase products or services online, we collect your credit card or other payment information in addition to your name, address and other identifying information. We may also verify your eligibility for certain programs, such as requesting your drivers’ license number for driving school programs.

**Newsletter:** On the newsletter section of the Sites, you may provide us with your e-mail address in order to subscribe for the Porsche newsletter, which contains the latest information on our products, events and our other offerings.

**Contests and Surveys:** In addition to your name, address and other identifying information, we may ask you to provide other information about your household and interests if you choose to participate in Porsche’s contests or surveys. You can always choose not to participate.

**Employment Opportunities:** Where the Sites allow the option of submitting your resumé or other indications of interest for employment at Porsche, we collect personal information such as name, contact information, job history and other background.

**Non-personal Information:** We collect non-personal information such as your Internet browser type, operating system, and the IP address of the website from which you are linked to the Sites. We use this information to help us tailor our Sites in a manner to better match your computer settings, interests and preferences.

**Porsche Dealers and Other Sources:** To the extent permitted by law, we may augment the information we have collected from you on the Sites with data obtained from other sources, including information you have provided to Porsche dealers, our affiliates or Porsche clubs, or information you have provided to us by phone or by mail. We may also obtain other information about you such as change of address, contact information or demographic information from commercially or publicly available sources.

**General Uses:** We will use your personal information as specifically described in the Site to which you submit it, in accordance with any published legal terms for such Site. We may also use your personal information internally to customize your experience with our company and our Sites, to communicate with you about our products or services, to help us develop new products and services, to verify your identity, to collect debts owed to us, or to investigate or settle inquiries or disputes, and for other legally required or permissible purposes.

Porsche may collect and share aggregate website statistical information (such as sales, traffic patterns or related information) with third parties. No such shared statistics will contain any personally identifying user information.
