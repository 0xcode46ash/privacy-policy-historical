PGEpark.com Privacy Policy

PGEPark.com is committed to respecting the privacy rights of all visitors to our web site. The following policy describes how we collect, protect and use information we receive from visitors to our site.

What information does PGEPark.com collect and how does PGEPark.com use it?  
• When you register on the site, we need you to provide your name, E-mail address and Team of interest. This allows us to keep a user profile so that we may customize preferences for each specific user, as well as provide a faster method for users to submit information to us, and receive back either the information desired.  
• When you register, you also have the discretion whether or not to submit your interest in ticket type, address, and phone number. This allows us to better know our visitors and possibly tailor any specific features, promotions, or other notifications to you.  
• Visitors will also be given a choice when registering whether they would like to be on our mailing list, or whether they would prefer to opt-out and not receive such mailings from us.  
• When you enter a contest, promotion, or use certain other site features, we may again ask for your name, address, e-mail address, date of birth, username, password or other information so that we are able to better administer the contest, promotion, or feature.  
• We may also use the information we collect during the registration process to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the Web site, new products and services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, or would like to opt-out of any other communication, simply follow the unsubscribe directions within the e-mail to be removed from our list.

How does PGEPark.com protect visitor information?  
We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems and who are required to keep the information confidential.

Do we use "cookies"?  
Yes. Cookies are bits of electronic information that a web site operator can transfer to your hard drive to help tailor and keep records of your visit to the site. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many web sites use them. Cookies allow us to better customize your visits to our site to your individual preferences. We also contract with third party service providers who assign cookies (which do not contain any personally identifiable information) to conduct site tracking for us. These companies use cookies solely to provide us with aggregate data about site traffic. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can usually change your browser to prevent that or notify you whenever you're sent a cookie. This gives you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it.

Do we disclose the information we collect to outside parties?  
Except for web site hosting partners, other parties who assist us in operating our web site and PFE Partners, we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide to us unless we receive your express consent in advance. For web site hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our site, we require them by contract to keep our customer information confidential.

However, customer information in an aggregate form may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

A special note to parents.  
We realize that many children will visit our site, and we therefore encourage children to consult with their parents before submitting any information to any web site, including ours. However, we believe that it is ultimately the parent's responsibility to supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing their name, address, and other personal information online without parental permission. For additional information about parental control tools, please consult the "Consumer Assistance" page of the Direct Marketing Association home page.

Third party links  
In an attempt to provide you with increased value, we may include third party links on our site. However, even if the third party is affiliated with PGEPark.com, we have no control over these linked sites which have separate and independent privacy and data collection practices. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content, including the privacy practices, of these linked sites. These linked sites are provided only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these linked sites (including if a specific link does not work).  
Please send concerns to: [webmaster@summitprojects.com](mailto:rob@summitprojects.com)

Your consent.  
By using our web site, you consent to our privacy policy.

Changes to our policy.  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page. Policy changes will apply only to information collected after the date of the change. This policy was last modified on January 29, 2001.

Questions and feedback.  
We welcome your questions, comments, and concerns about privacy. Please send us any and all feedback pertaining to privacy, or any other issue.
