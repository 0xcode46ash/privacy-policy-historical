**What personal information do we collect?**  
As a visitor to this Web site, your identity will remain anonymous unless you register to access certain products or services, such as the online account services, or elect to purchase certain goods using your credit card. In such cases, you will be notified that personal information, such as your name, address, phone number and e-mail address, is required. If you are starting a new electric service account, we will ask for additional personal information for credit verification and security purposes only. This information will be used to provide a requested service, to facilitate purchases or to provide you with an online newsletter. You may choose at any time not to receive e-mail from us.

**Online Purchases**  
In the event that you elect to make a purchase through this Web site, your credit card information will be required. For purchases made on this Web site through our Home Power Protection Program, we will collect your credit card information and other personal information such as your name, address and phone number. Your order and shipping information will be shared with our fulfillment vendor. In order to process payment for your purchase we will pass your credit card information to the necessary financial institutions. For purchases made using your credit card through our Home Power Protection Program, credit card numbers are received and stored in an encrypted format and remain encrypted in transit at all times. Access to credit card numbers is highly restricted and limited to a very few employees who have a need to process the information. PGE follows the Cardholder Information Security Program (CISP) guidelines set by VISA for handling credit card information electronically.

For purchases made through the Electronics Protection Store, your credit card number, in addition to your name, address, phone number and/or e-mail address will be transmitted to the vendor via encrypted e-mail. For these purchases, PGE does not store your credit card information.

Portland General Electric Co. will not sell or rent the information collected at this site to any party or share it in ways different from those disclosed in this statement.

**Release of information**  
On occasion, we may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to our Affinity Partners. This statistical information will not reveal any personally identifiable information.
