We Care About Your Privacy

Privacy Policy  


Portero, Inc. ("Portero") will not trade, sell, or disclose to any third party any form of customer identifiable information without the consent of the customer (except as required by subpoena, search warrant or other legal process or in the case where failure to disclose information will lead, in Portero's sole reasonable opinion, to imminent harm to the customer or others). This includes information derived from registration, application, and / or use of Portero's service. Notwithstanding this, Portero may share information with its partners or affiliates for the purpose of providing related services in which we deem our users have interest. The use that Portero's partners or affiliates make of customer information will not exceed Portero's use of the data. 

Portero shall collect and use customer identifiable information for billing, providing of Portero's service and to inform customers of new products or services that may be of interest to customer. If a customer expressly chooses not to participate in direct marketing of new products and services from Portero, that customer's information will not be used for the purpose of marketing new products. Key billing information (such as credit card number, expiration date and dollar amount) gathered from users making online purchases through Portero's services may be shared with VeriSign, our credit card processing partner, PayPal, eBay's credit card processor or other similar services in order to authorize charges to the credit card. 

Please be aware that in the event Portero merges with a third party or in the event all or substantially all of Portero's assets are acquired by a third party, customer information, including personally identifiable information, will be shared and/or transferred to such third party. The information may only be used or shared by such third parties for the primary purpose for which the information was originally collected. If such third parties, or if Portero for its own business needs, desire to use the personally identifiable information for another purpose, you will be notified prior to the information being used for a new purpose, and you will have the opportunity to opt out of such new use of your personally identifiable information. 

Portero protects your privacy by letting you remain anonymous. No buyer will ever harass you or know your identity. And our Deadbeat Bidder Database ensures that scam bidders never enter the picture.
