The Poynter Institute for Media Studies is committed to respecting privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for Poynter Online. Poynter is a non-profit school for journalists. We do not make any user information available to third parties. We take your privacy concerns seriously and we will do our best to make sure that we protect your privacy as much as possible on Poynter Online.

**Your Personal Information**  
We use information such as your IP address and browser type/version to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. We use cookies to save your Poynter Online Profile so you will not have to log in each time you visit our site and would like to use its more advanced features that require registration.

Poynter Online does not require registration to read the contents of the site.

Our feedback system requires you to register to post comments, and we promise that the information will not be shared with anyone. You should be aware, however, that anything you post to public feedback areas can be copied and used by any visitor to the site. On occasion, we may use your e-mail address to contact you with information about Poynter Online. If you choose to receive no communication from us, please send a note to [privacy@poynter.org](mailto:privacy@poynter.org).

**Search Terms**  
Periodically, we collect the terms users enter in searching for material on the site, but we do not associate those terms with individual users. To get a better sense of what users, in general, are looking for from Poynter Online, we generate a list of search terms that provides no indication of which user may have entered which terms.

**Links to Other Sites**  
This site contains links to other sites. Poynter Online is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. In various parts of Poynter Online, we have retained the use of vendors to provide specialized services. Examples: We work with DataGlyphics, Inc. of St. Petersburg for development and hosting services, and we have worked with Autonomy, Inc., for Nelson, our search engine. We will not share any of your information with those vendors.

**E-Commerce**  
Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitors’ contact information (including their e-mail address) and financial information (including their account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders and information about The Poynter Institute to our customers. The customer’s contact information also is used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. Users may opt out of receiving future mailings; see the [Choice/Opt Out section](http://www.poynter.org/profile/privacy_policy.asp#optout) below. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the customer for products and services.

Our online surveys may ask visitors for contact information (such as their e-mail address) and demographic information (such as their zip code, age, or income level). We use contact data from our surveys to send the user information about Poynter. The customer’s contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt out of receiving future mailings; see the [choice/opt-out section](http://www.poynter.org/profile/privacy_policy.asp#optout) below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. As we enhance the personalization aspects of Poynter Online, we may use this data to tailor our visitors’ experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences.

**Security**  
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.
