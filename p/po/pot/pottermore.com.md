# Pottermore: Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) contains 14 sections. You can view each section by selecting the links below:

## 1\. Introduction

1.1 Welcome to Pottermore (“Pottermore”), the digital home of the Harry Potter books! Pottermore is owned by Pottermore Limited (referred to as “we”, “us” or “our” as appropriate, a company established in England and Wales). Pottermore is currently available through the website at [http://www.pottermore.com](http://www.pottermore.com/). We may also make Pottermore or other versions of it available through a number of digital channels or devices. 

1.2 For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998, the data controller is Pottermore Limited. Please see our [Terms & Conditions](https://web.archive.org/en/terms) (“Terms”) and our [About Pottermore](https://web.archive.org/en/about) page for more information about Pottermore Limited.

1.3 We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of users of Pottermore and strive to make Pottermore a fun, safe and secure experience for all users. We encourage all users to act responsibly and with care when it comes to their personal information and that of others. Please read the following Privacy Policy to understand how the information you provide to us is used and protected. If you have any queries or concerns regarding these practices, please refer to our [Help](https://www.pottermore.com/en/help) pages in the first instance. 

1.4 Please note that by visiting and using Pottermore or consenting for your child to do the same, you are agreeing to the use of your or your child’s personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. For further information on how we use your child’s personal information and the measures we adopt to safeguard their privacy, please see our [Child Safety](https://web.archive.org/en/child-safety) policy.

## 2\. Changes to our Privacy Policy

2.1 We may make any change to this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make any material changes we will notify you by sending you an email to the last email address that you provided to us and/or by posting a copy of the changes on Pottermore. Subject to paragraph 2.2, any changes will take effect seven (7) days after the date of our email or the date we post the modified terms on Pottermore, whichever is earlier. Your continued use of Pottermore after that period expires means that you agree to be bound by the modified terms. As noted in our [Terms](https://web.archive.org/en/terms), you are responsible for keeping your account information up to date, including your parent or guardian’s email address. If the email address to which we send notification to you under this clause is no longer valid, the sending of our email (notifying you of any changes to the Terms) will be deemed, nonetheless, to be effective notice of the modified terms.

2.2 If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use and/or share personal information, we will give you prominent notice of these changes and offer you a choice about whether the changes should apply to any personal information that we previously collected from you. If we make material changes to how we collect and use personal information from children under the age of 13, we will notify parents or guardians by email in order to obtain verifiable parental consent for the new uses of your child’s personal information.

## 6\. Other types of information we collect and use 

6.1 We aim to provide a number of features on Pottermore that help provide a more personalised and enhanced experience to our users. To achieve this, we may collect and use a limited amount of non-personal information from you. In addition, we may ask you about which books and films in the Harry Potter series you have enjoyed. We will never publicly disclose any such information on Pottermore without obtaining your permission.

6.2 We also collect and share aggregated statistics data about visitors to Pottermore and traffic patterns with third parties such as our Partners. Just to be clear, this information does not identify users in any personal capacity; it simply gives generalised information about the users of Pottermore.

## 7\. Cookies

_Cookies and log files_

7.1 While on Pottermore, certain information is automatically logged about how you are using Pottermore to analyse performance and usage of Pottermore. This information may include the URL of the website which linked you to Pottermore, your IP address and the pages you visit while on Pottermore. The IP address indicates the location of your computer on the internet. 

7.2 Like many online services we may use a feature called a cookie. A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. It allows us to recognise you as a user when you return to Pottermore using the same device and web browser. We use the cookies (including some provided to us through online analytics services such as Google Analytics) and other automatically tracked information to: 

  * store login details. For example, to authenticate you as a user when you log in; 
  * enable you to move more easily around Pottermore; and 
  * track visitors to Pottermore to analyse performance and usage of Pottermore, in order to develop Pottermore in accordance with visitors’ requirements. 



7.3 You can delete cookies from your hard drive at any time. You can set your internet browser so that it will not allow cookies to be stored on your device. This may reduce functionality of Pottermore and may mean that certain features or content will not be available to you. Further information on how to prevent cookies from being stored on your device can be found on [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) under the 'manage cookies' section. Alternatively, you can access further information by going to the help menu within your internet browser. To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites visit [http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. ](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)

## 8\. Links

8.1 Pottermore contains links posted by us to third party websites that are not subject to this Privacy Policy. Read the [Terms](https://web.archive.org/en/terms) for further information on these links. In particular, you will see in paragraph 5.5 of the Terms that users are not permitted to distribute or post any links including links to websites, files or links that open or run programs. We strongly recommend that you read the privacy policy of any such websites that you visit.

## 9\. How do we protect personal information?

9.1 As required by UK Data Protection laws, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given to us to prevent unauthorised access. In particular, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt all your passwords. SSL encrypts the information you provide as it travels through the internet. Encryption creates millions of code combinations to protect each transaction made on the website, so your password or information cannot be viewed by anyone else using the internet. Despite using this technology, we cannot guarantee the security of the information that you disclose to us. You accept the inherent risks of providing information and dealing online and will not hold us responsible for any breach of security unless this is due to our negligence or wilful default.

9.2 If you have any concerns about security, please refer to our [Help](https://www.pottermore.com/en/help) pages in the first instance.

10.2 If you are a user aged 16 and above and you have previously consented to receiving marketing communications, you can withdraw this consent at any time by changing your Account Settings in your Experience Account. If you click on the “unsubscribe” link in any marketing communication, it will take you to the Account Settings page.

10.3 You can also edit your settings as described above in 10.2 to update your personal details held by us and to change your:

  * email address/parent’s email address; 
  * country of residence; 
  * language settings; and/or 
  * password.

12.5 Your personal information and activity history on Pottermore may persist in our backups after we have deleted your account(s) but will not be available to other users on Pottermore. We delete our backups every five (5) years and only use them if we need to restore content or functionality on Pottermore following a systems failure or to assist us with an investigation (please see paragraph 4 above for further information about how else we use your personal information).

## 13\. Transfer of information outside the EEA

13.1 We share your personal information with authorised third party service providers for the purpose of operating, managing and administering the accounts and services provided to you through Pottermore.
