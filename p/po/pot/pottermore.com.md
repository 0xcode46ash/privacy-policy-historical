## 3\. The information we collect and how we use it

 **Personal information**

3.1 We do not collect information that identifies you personally on or via pottermore.com, unless: (a) you choose to provide it to us when contacting us; or (b) the technical data that we collect (such as an IP address) are treated as personally identifying information under applicable laws; or (c) you provide this information to us in order to set up a Pottermore Account during the registration process. 

**Pottermore Account registration data**

If you wish to discover which house the Sorting Hat will place you in, which wand will choose you, or wish to discover other personalised content (together, the “Registered Services”), you will need to create an account on pottermore.com (“Pottermore Account”). Please note that the Registered Services are subject to age restrictions and may be subject to additional terms and conditions from time to time.  
When you register for a Pottermore Account, we may collect:

 **Your month and year of birth – these are not displayed publicly. We use this information only:**

  * to ensure that the site features and any communications you are offered are appropriate for your age range.



 **Your name (please use the name by which you would wish to be called) and email address – these are not displayed publicly. We use this information only:**

  * to identify you and to address you when communicating with you about your access to, or use of, pottermore.com;
  * to personalise your Pottermore Account;
  * to send you site-generated emails (for example, account verification emails);
  * to send you email communications from time to time containing: exclusive content; general news; special offers; prize promotions; and updates on events (for example, news about film or stage events), products, content and/or services (for example, information about attractions and books) provided by our trusted partners that are closely connected with pottermore.com, the Pottermore Shop, and J.K. Rowling’s Wizarding World, but only if you indicate that you wish to receive such communications via your Pottermore Account preferences, which will first be set at the time you create your Pottermore Account and can then be updated by you at any time. After receiving your permission to do so, we will send you email communications until you indicate that you wish to stop receiving such communications, which you can do at any time by following the instructions in section 9 (Editing your Pottermore Account settings and unsubscribing from Pottermore emails);
  * to send you a password reminder upon your request; and/or
  * for other business and operational purposes related to pottermore.com or your Pottermore Account.



 **Your gender – this is not displayed publicly. We use this information only:**

• to gain a better understanding of our audience.

 **Your password – this is not displayed publicly. We use this information only:**

• to give you the ability to log on to your Pottermore Account. 

**Information from other sources – this is not displayed publicly.**

We may receive information about you if you have registered with the Pottermore Shop. We also work closely with third parties (including, for example, business partners and analytics providers) and may receive information about you from them. In either case, we use this information in relation to pottermore.com for the purpose of understanding our audience. 

**Other types of information we collect and use**

In addition we may collect information that does not identify you personally for a variety of purposes as set out below:

 **Anonymous analytics data**

Like many companies who operate websites, we collect basic information about your use of our site, such as the number and duration of visits to pottermore.com, any search queries entered on our site, and details of which particular pages have been visited. We do not combine this information with any other information that could identify you personally. We use this information to analyse how pottermore.com is functioning and how it is used by our users, to help us maintain and improve pottermore.com on an ongoing basis.

 **Performance data**

While using pottermore.com, certain information is automatically logged about how you are using pottermore.com to analyse performance and usage of pottermore.com. This information may include the URL of the website that linked you to pottermore.com, your IP address and the pages you visit while on pottermore.com. The IP address indicates the location of your computer on the internet. We use this information to analyse how pottermore.com is functioning and how it is used by our users, to help us maintain and improve pottermore.com on an ongoing basis.

 **Third-party analytics data**

Like many companies that operate websites, we allow carefully selected third parties to set cookies in order to capture analytics information. When you use social-media functionality on pottermore.com, analytics cookies may be set to measure usage. This information is collected in an anonymous way that does not identify you personally.

 **Customer service queries**

If you contact us to raise a query, in doing so you may provide us with some of your personal information, such as your name or contact details. We use that personal information only for the purpose of responding to your query.

 **Children’s privacy**

We do not knowingly collect or use personal information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a user under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records. If you believe your child has provided us with personal information and you would like to have the personal information deleted, please contact us using the contact information below.

## 4\. How else may we use the information we collect?

4.1 We may use the information we collect to investigate a potential breach of pottermore.com’s [Terms & Conditions](https://web.archive.org/about/terms) or to prevent and detect unlawful or criminal activity, fraud and misuse of, or damage to, pottermore.com or the services made available through it, and to take appropriate legal action against those responsible.

4.2 We may on occasion link or combine the information that we collect about you with information that we receive from other sources. We may combine this information with information you give to us and information we collect about you. (For example, we may decide to combine two or more databases into a single database of user information.) We may use this information and the combined information for your and/or our benefit (for example, to allow us to provide a more seamless support whenever you contact us or to provide you with better, personalised services and content and/or, where you opted to receive such communications, recommendations about trusted partners’ products, content or services that might interest you). 

## 5\. Personal information sharing and disclosure

We share your personal information in certain limited ways as described below.

5.4 We do not send any information that we collect on pottermore.com to any social networking sites, nor do we share that information with such sites. We do not collect any personal information about you from those sites. We may, however, disclose information we collect, including personal information, to the following, for the express purposes set out below: (a) to our employees, agents and authorised third-party providers for them to administer any accounts or services provided to you through pottermore.com as described above (including, if you are a Registered User, in relation to the registration, creation and operation of your Pottermore Account); (b) if there is a change in the ownership of Pottermore Limited or any of its assets, including a change as a result of insolvency or bankruptcy, we may have to disclose information to the new owner. If we do so, we will require them to use it only in accordance with the terms of our Privacy & Cookies Policy; (c) apart from the use and sharing of your personal information in the circumstances already described, we may share information we collect (including personal information) as required or allowed by law (for example, as needed to protect our and our licensors’ rights and property or to comply with any applicable law or valid legal process).
