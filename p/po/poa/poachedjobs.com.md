# Privacy | Restaurant Jobs - Poached Jobs

Poached (“Poached”) operates a website, Austin.PoachedJobs.com. It is Poached’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

#### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Poached collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Poached’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Poached’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Poached may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

#### Aggregated Statistics

Poached may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. However, Poached does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

#### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Poached’s websites choose to interact with Poached in ways that require Poached to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Poached gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, Poached collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Poached. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities. For instance, Poached collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments. Poached only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.

#### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Poached uses cookies to help Poached identify and track visitors, their usage of Poached website, and their website access preferences. Poached visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Poached’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Poached’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

#### Ads

Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Poached and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Poached may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Poached’s sole discretion. Poached encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a Poached account your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
