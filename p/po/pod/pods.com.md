 **Personal Information.** PODS collects personal information of its customers only when they voluntarily submit such information to us, such as when placing an order through the website. "Personal information" means any information by which you can be personally identified and may include, for example, name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number, credit card information, your responses to survey questions, and information relating to any orders you place.

Although we can not prevent children under 18 from submitting personal information, we will destroy such information if we are made aware that proper consent was not given.

 **Use/Disclosure.** We will only use information collected by us for responding to your inquiries and otherwise corresponding with you, processing orders you have submitted, and maintaining your account. We may use aggregate statistics about our customer’s preferences, geographical information, or other patterns, but no information that can be traceable to a particular individual.

We do not sell or release our customer’s personal information to outside organizations. However, we may disclose information you provide to us to third parties in order to complete a transaction that you requested (for example, disclosing credit card information for processing purposes is necessary to complete transactions).

 ** _Security  
_  
** PODS recognizes your personal data is your private information, so we strive to achieve high standards in how it is used and providing for its safekeeping. PODS’ website uses some of the most secure forms of online communication available, including industry-standard encryption technology to keep your personal information safe. Whenever you provide information, we use secure socket layer (“SSL”) technology to make sure that it is "encrypted," or, scrambled, so that no one else can read it while it is being transmitted over the Internet.

To protect your personal information, PODS maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in keeping with industry standards and practices, all of which are regularly updated in response to changes in technology. We strictly limit access to information about you to those employees who need to know the information in order to perform their jobs. All employees are prohibited from accessing our files and databases without proper authorization. We periodically audit for compliance with this standard and impose penalties for any failure to comply with this policy.

You should always safeguard your own personal information by protecting passwords used to access websites and by safely disposing of records no longer needed.

You should check this page periodically for changes which will be prominently announced by the posting of a notification. Your continued use of this website following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy Statement will mean that you accept those changes.
