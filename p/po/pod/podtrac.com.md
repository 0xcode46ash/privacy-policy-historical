# Privacy Policy - Podtrac

At Podtrac we care about your privacy.  Podtrac, Inc. (“Podtrac”) interacts with current and prospective clients and the general public via its website, Podtrac.com, and other consumer-facing and publicly available sites, products, services and platforms offered by Podtrac (collectively, “Offering(s)”).  This Privacy Policy describes Podtrac’s privacy-related policies and practices as they relate to the collection and use of information gathered from users of Podtrac’s Offerings.

Podtrac also conducts online surveys and operates various research panels involving consumers.  Podtrac’s privacy policy relating to such activities is posted at the entry point to each individual survey or panel, and describes policies for those activities.

 **Privacy Commitment**

Podtrac recognizes the importance of privacy to Internet users and is committed to respecting the privacy and confidentiality of users of its Offerings.

 **Children**

Our Offerings are not directed to children and children are not eligible to use our Offerings.  We do not collect or maintain PII (as defined below) from individuals who we know are under 13 years of age, and no part of our Offerings is designed to attract people under 13 years of age.  If we later learn that a user is under 13 years of age, we will take steps to remove that user’s PII from our databases and to prevent the user from using our offerings.

 **A Note to Users Outside of the United States.**

If you are a non U.S. user of our Offerings, by visiting our Offerings and/or providing us with information, you acknowledge and agree that your PII may be processed for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy.  In addition, your PII may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of PII may be less stringent than the laws in your country.  By providing your PII, you consent to such transfer and/or processing. 

 **Collection, Use, Disclosure of Information**

Podtrac collects personally identifiable information (“PII”) from users of its website and from businesses (e.g., advertisers, agencies and publishers) (“Clients”) wishing to use Podtrac’s Offerings.  Clients are required to provide PII in order to register for Podtrac’s Offerings and to receive certain Podtrac publications.  Examples of PII that may be requested include name, address, phone number, email address, etc.  Podtrac may also collect non-PII, such as zip code, approximate location, browser type, cookie IDs, device identifiers, IP address, websites visited, and advertisements viewed or clicked.  Podtrac also collects non-PII such as aggregated, de-identified, and/or anonymized data.  This information is used to allow Podtrac to conduct business with its Clients, e.g., for verification of data and for sending administrative e-mails regarding Offerings.  Third parties interested in obtaining additional information about Podtrac’s Offerings may also provide personally identifiable information to Podtrac via our website.  

Whether you interact with an Offering as a visitor or Client, Podtrac automatically creates logs regarding user sessions, which session logs include the following information:  information sent to us by browsers, including, for example, browser type, time of access, screen resolution, IP address, referring site URL, current site URL, and search strings; and features that you use, actions that you take and information that you access.  We generally use this information in statistical and aggregate formats to assess the effectiveness of our Offerings and to better understand your priorities and interests.

Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy or as required by law, Podtrac does not sell, distribute or disclose to third parties your PII collected via the Offerings without your consent.  Podtrac reserves the right to sell, distribute or disclose non-PII in its sole discretion.

Podtrac currently provides free services to podcast publishers whereby Podtrac gathers data specific to individual podcasts (e.g., audience survey data, content ratings, measurement data, etc.).  This podcast data is not PII and may be shared by Podtrac with member advertisers or other third parties in Podtrac’s sole discretion.

If you contact us by email, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence.  If you provide contact information to us, we may use that information to contact you with Podtrac newsletters, marketing, or promotional materials.  If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.

 **Information Shared with our Service Providers**

We may use third parties and Podtrac affiliate companies to help us administer and improve our Offerings.  For example, these companies may assist with hosting, data processing, database management, and administrative tasks.  These third parties and affiliates may have access to your PII, but only to perform these tasks on our behalf.

 **Use of Cookies**

Cookies are pieces of data stored on a user’s hard drive that contain information about a user.  To enable secure content access, we use cookies that contain encrypted login information so we can ensure that Client-specific information is secure from unauthorized access.  These cookies are used only for this purpose and are intended to be used only by our Offerings.  (You can view and delete these cookies by accessing the privacy settings of your browser.)

 **Choice and Data Access**

Clients who register on our website can view and modify their profile information in the secure Client areas of our site.

 **Data Security/Integrity**

Podtrac employs industry standard security measures designed to protect the security of all data.  Data stored on Podtrac’s servers is treated as proprietary and confidential and is not available to the public.  Only authorized employees and contractors have access to PII.  Our employees and contractors who have access to this data have agreed to maintain the confidentiality of this information.

 **Information Disclosed in a Change of Ownership**

Podtrac may sell, transfer, or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your PII, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.  

 **Other Websites and Apps**

The fact that we link to a particular site or app or receive data from a site or app, does not mean that we endorse that site or app, or its privacy practices.  Other sites and apps have their own terms of use and privacy policies, and we encourage you to read those terms and policies when you use those services.

 **Notification of Changes**

If we change our practices in handling PII as described in this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting the changes on this Privacy Policy.
