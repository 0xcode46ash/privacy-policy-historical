# Privacy Policy | Podio

_Last Updated on March 12, 2015_

Citrix Podio is committed to respecting your privacy. This Online Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices for Podio's website (www.podio.com or the "Site"), the Podio mobile application (the "App") as well as Podio’s collaboration services (the "Services"). 

Podio has received TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy statement and our practices have been reviewed for compliance with the TRUSTe program viewable on the validation page available by clicking the TRUSTe seal. If you are not satisfied with our response you can contact TRUSTe [here](http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint). The TRUSTe programs apply only to the information collected on the Podio Site, Podio App and Podio Services, and do not apply to any downloadable software available on the Site. 

Podio complies with the U.S. – E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Podio has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

## 1\. Why is my information needed?

Podio products are web based; because of this they may require the use of first and last names, billing contact information, a password and a valid email address as a login. Therefore, at a minimum, we may require such necessary information in order to establish your account with us.

## 2\. What information does Podio gather/track and how is it used?

**PERSONAL INFORMATION** : Information gathered at www.podio.com is done so on a voluntary basis. We collect personal information from users including (at a minimum) first and last names, an email address to be used as a login, and a password as well as comments on blog postings and job and press inquires. When a user registers online for the free version of the service, Podio will take steps to verify the email address supplied to us to ensure it is accurate. The premium service requires Podio to collect billing contact information and a credit card number which will also be verified to ensure it is accurate. Your email address may be used to send you periodic product newsletters, offers and usage tips from Podio. We use the collected information to deliver services, process payments, update our records, communicate with you about products and services, and generally maintain your accounts with us. Because of our commitment to present the best possible product to all our users, we track the category of services selected by our individual users as well as all information pertaining to user satisfaction. To ensure the quality of our product, we reserve the right to maintain evaluation and feedback records. 

**BUSINESS INFORMATION** : Information that is collected by our Services is considered confidential Business Information. Business Information includes app data, task data, messages, files, contact lists, and any other business information you provided when using the Podio Services. We will collect and use Business Information only as necessary to appropriately support the Service, for the purpose of anticipating, diagnosing, supporting or resolving any problems that might limit or disrupt the quality of our customers’ service experience or as required by law. We do not build or give access to administrative tools that would allow Podio employees to view business information. You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit to your Podio profile or blog can be read, collected or used by others who share the same workspace(s) as you. 

**MOBILE APPLICATIONS** : When you download and use our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and information necessary to configure the application for your device and preferences. We collect geolocation data only if a user elects to provide it in conjunction with an activity such as a post. You may opt-in to receive push notifications in order to alert you to messages, tasks, items in which you are mentioned or referenced, subscribed events, workspace changes, or reminders you have set. You can change your notifications at any time in the app Settings. 

**PARTNERS** : In some cases we provide the Services or sell product lines jointly with other businesses. For these co-branded offerings in which a third party is involved in your transactions, we will sometimes share or jointly collect customer information related to those transactions with that third party. On the co-branded registration pages we will state who is collecting or receiving the information and whose privacy statement governs its use so that you will know at the time you create your account exactly how your information will be used. If you are registered with Podio through a partnership and you request to opt out of receiving promotional updates we will also provide your email address to that partner so that they may also discontinue sending you messages on behalf of Podio. 

**AFFILIATES** : We may sometimes share or jointly collect information with our parent entity (Citrix Systems, Inc.) and the wholly owned subsidiaries and affiliated divisions of our parent company entity. 

**SESSION RECORDS** : To maintain our quality of service and to assist in the analysis of product performance, we may also gather data on connection information, including the timing and size of all packets sent over the Internet during a session. The gathered information is used only to ensure the highest quality experience possible when using Podio products. 

**SECURITY INFORMATION** : Podio also collects certain standard information about your computer for security and identification purposes. This information may include: IP addresses, domain names, access times, cookies and other unique identifying information of machines that have our software downloaded and installed on them. This information is used for the operation of the service, to identify and protect our customers and to control unauthorized use or abuse of our services. All information is encrypted during transmission and is stored securely within our servers. 

**SURVEYS** : In addition to required member information, we may conduct surveys and ask users to volunteer demographic information to be used on an aggregate basis for internal market research, presentation to advertisers and joint research projects with outside companies involved in product development. We use such information to better focus our product and personalize the scope of services offered to each individual user. 

**WEB AND MOBILE ANALYTICS** : We continuously improve our Sites and Apps and utilize different analytic tools to help us do so, such as cookies and web beacons. We are interested in how visitors use our products, what they like and dislike, and where they have problems. We also use analytic tools on our Apps to help gather non-personally identifiable data about download and application usage. In our use of analytics tools we do collect general geographic data, but it is only on an aggregate basis and not specific to an individual’s exact location. We may use precise geolocation data, but only if you specifically opt-in to collection of such data. These tools may be provided by third parties in order to assist us in collecting the information. 

**GOOGLE ANALYTICS** : We use Google Analytics as described in [How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/) You can prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics on websites by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). We also employ IP address masking, a technique used to truncate IP addresses collected by Google Analytics and store them in an abbreviated form to prevent them from being traced back to individual users. Portions of our website may also use Google Analytics for Display Advertisers including DoubleClick or Dynamic Remarketing which provide interest-based ads based on your visit to this or other websites. You can use [Ads Settings](http://www.google.com/settings/ads) to manage the Google ads you see and opt-out of interest-based ads. 

**WEB BEACONS** : Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. The web beacons used in connection with our web analytics services do not share any personally identifiable information about our website visitors with third parties. These tools may gather data such as what browser a person uses, what operating systems are used, what is downloaded, and what content, products and services are reviewed when visiting or registering for services at one of our websites. This information is used solely to assist Podio in maintaining a more effective and useful website for our customers. We track aggregate traffic patterns throughout our Site but we do not correlate this information with personally identifiable data about individual users. We also track domain names, browser types and MIME type. 

**COOKIES** : A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit them. We use cookies to track user traffic patterns and hold certain registration information. When you register at Podio Sites, we use cookies to store unique, randomly assigned user IDs that we generate for administrative purposes. These cookies enable you to enter the Podio Sites without having to log on each time. We do not store passwords or any Personal Information about you in the cookies. We may also use cookies in partnership with selected marketing companies to help us track the effectiveness of our websites, generate visitor traffic, or as part of a referral program. 

Our site may also use local shared objects (LSOs), also known as HTML 5 and Flash cookies. LSOs are used to store preferences for the videos such as volume control. They are not used to back up, recreate, or re-spawn a browser cookie that a user may delete. LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount of and type of data stored, as well as the way that data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies please click [here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118). Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. 

We have no control over the use of third party tracking technologies after they are placed on our Site. If you wish to not have the information these technologies collect used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). The Help section on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether. You can still review the Site if you choose to set your browser to refuse all cookies; however, you must enable cookies in order to establish an account and to download and install any of the software. 

**SOCIAL MEDIA** : Our Site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Facebook Connect. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. These services will also authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Site to your profile page to share with others within your network. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them. 

**TESTIMONIALS** : With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us via one of the methods listed in this privacy policy.
