## Privacy Policy

PointRoll firmly believes in the importance of online privacy for its advertisers, publishers and users. We welcome you to read the following privacy policy to learn more about PointRoll's online information collection practices. 

This privacy policy only governs PointRoll's online information collection practices and does not apply to any information you may provide to us or that we may collect offline and/or through other means (for example, via telephone, or through the mail). If we need to change this privacy policy in the future, we will post the changes to the privacy policy on this website and update the Effective Date of the privacy policy to reflect the date of the changes. 

PointRoll does NOT collect any personally identifying information in connection with the delivery of our advertisements, nor from the websites on which those advertisements appear. PointRoll's patent-pending technology may use non-personally-identifying information, such as browser cookies, to improve the user experience, including to better direct ads to specific types of visitors, and/or to measure the effectiveness of these advertisements for the advertiser. This information is never redistributed to anyone outside of PointRoll, Inc. Also, to help protect your privacy, PointRoll Ads are delivered via P3P-compliant servers that communicate the details of this policy to P3P-enabled web browsers such as Internet Explorer 6.0. 

In most cases, any information (including personally identifying information) that is supplied by users within the panels of PointRoll Ads is provided directly to the advertiser, and is not collected by either PointRoll or the publisher's site on which the advertisement is displayed. This information is used solely for the purpose that is identified by the advertiser within the advertisement in which the data is being supplied or as established within that advertiser's privacy policy. 

In certain cases, an advertiser may request that PointRoll assist the advertiser in collecting the information supplied by users within the panels of PointRoll Ads, which may include personally identifying information. When this occurs, PointRoll only collects such information on behalf of that advertiser and this information is used solely by that advertiser for the purposes identified within the advertisement (e.g., to provide the user with requested goods, services, or information). PointRoll is not responsible for the advertisers' use of this voluntarily supplied information. PointRoll does NOT distribute this information to any party other than those indicated within the advertisement. 

In some cases, information (including personally identifying information) that is supplied by users within the panels of PointRoll Ads for use of services of a third-party (for example, supply of userid and password for use of Twitter) is provided directly to the third party, and is not stored by either PointRoll or the publisher's site on which the advertisement is displayed. This information is used solely for the purpose that is identified by the third party within the advertisement in which the data is being supplied or as established within that third party's privacy policy. 

Depending on the user's individual browser settings, some anti-spyware software programs may erroneously flag PointRoll advertisements or cookies as computer threats. PointRoll does not distribute viruses or any computer code that monitors or causes changes to users' computer system registries as part of its advertisements or cookies. 

If a user would like to Opt-Out of the non-personally-identifying cookies that PointRoll may use, the user can click on the Opt-Out link below. To Opt-back-In after having Opted-Out, simply click the Opt-In link below.

Note: This Opt-Out process provides an opt-out cookie to your browser. Therefore, if cookies are disabled, erased, or altered, or browser and/or machine software is changed, then the results of this opt-out process may be undone, and the opt-out will need to be performed again. 

Please note that we may occasionally release information that we collect in order to comply with law, or to protect the rights, property or safety of advertisers, publishers, users, the public or PointRoll. Also, in the event that we sell some or all of our assets, or we are acquired by another company, information that we collect may be among the transferred assets. 

_Your California Privacy Rights_

California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our customers who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to: **PointRoll, Privacy Information Request, 951 East Hector Street, Conshohocken, PA 19248**.
