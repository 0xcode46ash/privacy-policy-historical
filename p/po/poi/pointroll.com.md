## Privacy Policy

PointRoll firmly believes in the importance of online privacy for its advertisers, publishers and users. We welcome you to read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. 

PointRoll does NOT collect any personally identifying information during or after the delivery of our advertisements, nor from the websites on which those advertisements appear. PointRoll's patent-pending technology may use non-personally-identifying information, such as browser cookies, to improve the user experience, including to better direct ads to specific types of visitors, and/or to measure the effectiveness of these advertisements for the advertiser. This information is never redistributed to anyone outside of PointRoll, Inc. Nor is this information ever associated with personal data such as email, name, address, or any other identifying information about the end user. Also, to help protect your privacy, PointRoll Ads are delivered via P3P-compliant servers which communicate the details of this policy to P3P-enabled web browsers such as Internet Explorer 6.0. 

Depending on the user's individual setting, some anti-spyware software programs will erroneously flag PointRoll advertisements or cookies as computer threats. This is simply not the case as PointRoll does not engage in any spamming, virus or other negative attacks against users' computers. 

If an end user would like to Opt-Out of the non-personally-identifying cookies that PointRoll may use, the user can click on the Opt-Out link below. To Opt-back-In after having Opt'ed-Out, simply click the Opt-In link below.

---|---|---  
  
Note: This Opt-Out process provides an opt-out cookie to your browser. Therefore, if cookies are disabled, erased, or altered, or browser and/or machine software is changed, then the results of this opt-out process maybe undone, and the opt-out will need to be performed again. 

Data collection and submission that occurs within the panels of PointRoll Ads is provided directly to the advertiser, and is not collected by either PointRoll or the publisher's site on which the advertisement is displayed. This data is used solely for the purpose that is identified by the advertiser within the advertisement in which the data is being collected or as established within that advertiser's privacy policy. 

On some occasions, an advertiser may request that PointRoll provides or assists in the data collection of information supplied within panels of PointRoll Ads, which may include some personal information. When this occurs, PointRoll only does so on the behalf of that advertiser. This information is used solely by that advertiser for the purposes identified within the advertisement to provide the user with requested goods, services, or information. PointRoll is not responsible for the advertisers' use of this voluntarily supplied data. PointRoll does NOT distribute this information to any party other than those indicated within the advertisement. PointRoll never associates any of this information with any data gathered or used in the delivery of that advertisement. 

_Your California Privacy Rights_

California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our customers who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing. 

To address any questions, comments, or concerns related to our privacy policy, please email [support@pointroll.com](mailto:support@pointroll.com).
