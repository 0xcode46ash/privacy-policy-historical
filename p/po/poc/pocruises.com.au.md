# P&O Cruises Australia - Privacy Policy

Carnival plc is a publicly listed company in the United Kingdom. Carnival plc, trading as P&O Cruises, has registered branches in Australia (ABN 23 107 998 443 2TA 5580), and New Zealand.

These branches (collectively referred to as “we”, “us”, “our” or “P&O Cruises”) are subject to the National Privacy Principles introduced under Australian privacy legislation and the Information Privacy Principles introduced under New Zealand privacy legislation. 

All of our websites (including [www.pocruises.com.au](http://www.pocruises.com.au/) and [www.pocruises.co.nz](http://www.pocruises.co.nz/)) are maintained by our Australian branch and are subject to our Website Terms & Conditions.

Our WEBSITE PRIVACY STATEMENT details the privacy protection you are afforded when your personal information is collected through one of our websites. If you would like to view our [GENERAL PRIVACY STATEMENT](https://web.archive.org/web/20060615231824id_/http%3A//www.pocruises.com.au/html/general_policy.cfm), which governs how both of these branches manage personal information in general, please visit [GENERAL PRIVACY](https://web.archive.org/web/20060615231824id_/http%3A//www.pocruises.com.au/html/general_policy.cfm) page.

We are committed to protecting the privacy of all persons we have contact with online to the same extent and standards as contact made by other means of communication. However, contact through our website has slightly different implications due to the nature of the technology. 

**How Do We Collect Your Personal Information Online?**

In an online environment there are several means by which information may be collected. The type of information collected depends on how you have interacted with our website. 

**1.** **Browser detection and Server log files**   
When you visit our website (or any Internet site) the server records a number of details of your visit, including: 

  * the type of browser and operating system (eg. Mac, PC) you are using
  * the address of the referring site (ie. the previous site that you visited)
  * your IP address (a number unique to the computer through which you are connected to the Internet)
  * the country or region you come from
  * the date and time of your visit
  * the address of the pages accessed and documents you downloaded.



In addition to this we also use software to detect what screen size your computer uses and what plug-ins you have. Plug-ins are used to run features such as our Flash movies and the Quicktime VR ship and cabin virtual tours. The sole purpose of this is to make sure we can present the best viewing experience for each visitor. Also if you send us an error report, to assist us in resolving that error, we use software to detect whether you are browsing from behind a firewall and what type of error you have encountered.

**2.** **Cookies**   
Cookies are pieces of information that a website can transfer to an individual's computer hard drive for tracking the websites browsed by the person. This tracking enables us to customise our site information to your requirements and interests. By these means our website can become easier to use as the cookie will store information about your preferences on our website, for example if you’ve already seen a Flash movie you won’t have to see it again. Cookies are not unusual, most major websites use them. Indeed most internet browsers accept cookies. However, you can set your internet browser to refuse the cookies entry into your computer's hard drive. If you are not sure how to do this, contact the company which produces your browser. You can also delete the cookie after leaving the site so that you are seen as a new user when you next visit. Your level of satisfaction using our site may be impeded if you do not accept our cookie. 

**3.** **Email & Web Forms**   
If you send us email via our website or you complete a form on our website (eg. to request a brochure), the personal information submitted may be retained for the purposes of answering your query or complying with your request. Every email we receive is automatically stored on our server and backed up in accordance with our usual data management procedures. If you have completed a web form to request one of our brochures, you will be added to our mailing list to ensure that you receive notifications of any special promotions that are on offer. Any information we collect is held in the strictest confidence and in accordance with our privacy policy. It is stored securely and access is restricted.

**How Do We Use The Personal Information We Have Collected From You Online?**

We use your information to improve the way we present material on our website. It also enables us to gauge which of our services most interest visitors and tailor them to your needs and interests. Your personal information will not be used, without your consent, for any other purpose, other than the purpose for which it was provided. 

Some of our functions are provided by third parties. In those instances, it is necessary for us to supply your information to a third party as part of fulfilling the purpose for which you have provided the information (for example, the agency which administers and maintains our e-newsletter on our behalf). Whilst we do not seek your consent again we do seek an assurance from that third party that the information will only be used for the purpose for which it is supplied and that your information is kept safe and secure in line with our own policies in that regard. 

**Disclosure To Prevent a Threat to Life or Health or to Comply with Law**

If Carnival plc has reasonable grounds to believe that disclosure is necessary to prevent a threat to life or health or is required to provide information in response to subpoenas or warrants or other legal processes, it will disclose your information for those purposes without seeking your consent. 

**Opt Out**

All our email communication with you is on an Opt In basis, that is, you decide which specific service you want. Every email you receive from us will have details of how to remove yourself simply from our email lists. Remember to change your preference for each email address and other contact details you have given us. If you have any difficulty with this process you can email the Web Editor at [editor@pocruises.com.au](mailto:editor@pocruises.com.au) and specify your request. Please let us know whether you would like to opt out of one or more of our services or whether you would prefer not to receive any notifications from us at all. 

**Acceptance Of And Changes To Our WEBSITE PRIVACY STATEMENT**

You acknowledge and accept that your use of our websites indicates your acceptance of our WEBSITE PRIVACY STATEMENT and our WEBSITE TERMS & CONDITIONS. If we decide to change our WEBSITE PRIVACY STATEMENT, we will post these changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect online, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it.
