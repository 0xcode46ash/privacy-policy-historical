## Privacy Policy

## This privacy policy was last updated 11/21/05 

Ottaway Newspapers, Inc., the parent company of Ottaway Newspaper Group, and its affiliates (collectively referred to as "Ottaway", "we", "us" or "our", as applicable) are committed to maintaining the privacy of personal information that you provide to us when using their respective web sites (the "Pocono Record"). This Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal information received about you when you visit the Pocono Record. 

Website Usage Information

We automatically collects IP addresses and web site usage information from you when you visit the Pocono Record. This information helps us in evaluating how our visitors use and navigate the Pocono Record on an aggregate basis, including the number and frequency of visitors to each page of the Pocono Record, and the length of their visits. 

Features

When you use some of the special features of the Pocono Record and at other times, we may collect personally identifiable information from you that may include your name, age, address, e-mail address, credit-card number and facts about your interests and similar information. 

Surveys and Forms

We may conduct occasional online surveys or ask you to fill in forms. For example, when you are within the Pocono Record, you may see a pop-up window offering you the optional opportunity of participating in a survey. These surveys and forms are entirely voluntary and you may easily decline to participate. 

Children

We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 although certain third party sites that we link to may do so. These third-party sites have their own terms of use and privacy policies and we encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide information on the Pocono Record without their permission. 

How We Use Information Collected

We may use information that you provide us in the following ways: 

  * For the purposes for which you specifically provided the information, for example, when you request that additional information be sent to you, we will use your personal information to process your request. 
  * To send you e-mail notifications about our new or existing services, special offers, or to otherwise contact you. 
  * To allow us to personalize the content and advertising that you and others see based on personal characteristics or preferences. 
  * To enhance existing features or develop new features, products and services. 
  * To provide advertisers and other third parties with aggregate information about our user base and usage patterns. 



We may combine the information that we collect from you on the Pocono Record with information that you provide to us in connection with your use of our other products, services and web sites. 

We use third party network advertisers to deliver ads to you on our behalf. We may also use third-party service providers to contact you on our behalf, or facilitate some aspects of our services or fulfill your requests. These network advertisers and service providers may be supplied with or have access to your personally identifiable information solely for the purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf. 

We may disclose and use personally identifiable information in special circumstances where it is necessary to enforce our Terms of Use (for example, when necessary to protect our intellectual property rights) or when we, in our sole discretion, believe it is necessary or appropriate, in connection with a sale or transfer of some or all of our assets in the Pocono Record. We may also disclose personally identifiable information when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires us to do so. As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In transactions such as these, customer information is generally one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, in the unlikely event that we or one of our publishing lines are acquired, customer information may be one of the transferred assets.

Except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your personally identifiable information outside of Ottaway unless you "opt in" to having your personally identifiable information shared with a company that is not affiliated with us.

Your Ability to Choose

You can always decide not to provide your personal information to the Pocono Record, however in some cases failing to provide such information may limit your ability to use certain or features available at the Pocono Record. You can let us know that you do not wish to receive information about special offers and new products and features by opting out at the time you give us your personally identifiable information or after opting in by contacting us at the following e-mail address: [webmaster@poconorecord.com](mailto:webmaster@poconorecord.com)

Cookies

We use cookies to allow you to move quickly through our site, to recognize repeat visitors and to allow you to take advantage of some of our site's special features. A cookie is a string of information that is sent by a Web site and stored on your hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory. Cookies are small files (just a few hundred bytes) and should not pose any significant disk-space concerns. When you visit the Pocono Record, or use some of the features, like saving your personalized Pocono Record settings, we may pass cookies to your computer. Some of the cookies that we pass to your computer are long term. Otherwise, we would need to ask you for certain information with each new session, such as your login information. Some cookies do expire after a short period of time. 

Other cookies that you will receive during your sessions here are from third-party service providers or third party network advertisers. These network advertisers may use their own cookies in order to serve ads on the Pocono Record, ensuring that you will not see the same ads over and over again. We are not responsible for the cookies of such third parties or any use of your personal information collected by such third parties. 

Pocono Record Ads

When you view an ad for the Pocono Record on other sites, our third party advertising company may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. The Pocono Record and the advertising company may also use invisible images (often referred to as pixel tags, clear GIFs or web beacons) to note which Pocono Record pages you visit after viewing our ads. The information that is collected through the use of these images is not personally identifiable and is used only to track responses to our advertising efforts.

We recommend that you review the terms of use and privacy policy at each such web site to determine how that site protects your privacy. We are not responsible for the content of those web sites or the actions of third party web site operators.
