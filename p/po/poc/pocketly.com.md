We may use such non-personal information for internal purposes, including but not limited to improving the content of our website and App. Pocketly may use personally identifiable information in aggregate form to improve our goods and services, including our website, and to make them more responsive to the needs of our customers. This statistical compilation and analysis of information may also be used by Pocketly, or provided to others as a summary report for marketing, advertising, or research purposes.

### Confidentiality and Security

We limit access to personal information about you to employees for whom we reasonably believe it is necessary in order to provide products or services to you. We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our website.
