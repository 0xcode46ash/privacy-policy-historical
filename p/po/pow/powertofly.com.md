# Privacy Policy

Effective October 30, 2014 

PowerToFly Inc. ("PowerToFly", "we" or "us") is committed to respecting the privacy of your information. This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") describes the personal information we collect through our website and any mobile applications (the "Site"), and how we collect and use this information. Terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given to them in the Terms of Service, available [here](https://web.archive.org/terms).

### 1\. COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.

Depending on how you use the Site, we may ask you to share personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") with us. Whether you choose to share your Personal Information is completely up to you, but keep in mind that you may not be able to access some areas of the Site or effectively use the services we offer on the Site without sharing Personal Information. Personal Information includes any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact or locate you. Examples include your name, address, email address, phone number, age, educational background and credit card information. Below are some examples of when we collect Personal Information. 

1.1 Basic Account Information. When you register for the Site, we will ask you to provide your name and e-mail address or to log in using an existing social media account. Please see paragraph 4 regarding the information that we may collect from such social media accounts. We may use your email address to send you account confirmations, notifications, and to otherwise provide services to you in connection with the Site. We also use your Personal Information for administrative purposes, such as addressing account and billing issues, troubleshooting Site issues, investigating abuse on the Site, responding to inquiries and enforcing and applying our Terms of Service. 

1.2 Contractors. If you are registering as a Contractor, we may also ask for the following information: phone number, Skype ID, photo, work history, educational background, location, biographical information and skills. Contractors have the option to control whether Personal information is made publicly available on the Site through the Contractor’s profile privacy settings. 

1.3 Companies. If you are registering as a Company, we may also ask for the following information: phone number, location, company name, company logo, website URL, company size and contact person(s). 

1.4 Reviews and Other Public Content. Companies may have the opportunity to provide reviews about Contractors they have used. Users may also have other opportunities to contribute to the Site, such as public forums, bulletin boards and talk threads. We may store these contributions ("Public Content"), display them to other Users, and use them for promotional purposes. Your Public Content becomes public information once you post it, and copies of it may continue to be viewable even after you delete your account. Your Public Content may appear on other websites or web searches, and therefore this information can be read, collected and used by others. Note that if you include Personal Information about yourself in your Public Content, it can be used and viewed by others. Please remember that you are not permitted to disclose any Personal Information about another User or anyone else in your Public Content. 

1.5 Payment Information. To process payments, we will require your credit card information and billing information. Credit card transactions are processed through a third party, which only uses your information for that purpose. 

### 2\. COLLECTION AND USE OF NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION.

Non-personal information is information that does not identify the specific User. This type of information may include things like the URL of the website you visited before and after visiting our Site, the type of browser you are using, and the IP address of the computer you use to visit the Site. 

2.1 Cookies. We collect some anonymous information about how you use the Site by setting and accessing cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer. These cookies track information such as how often you visit the Site, what pages you view, and where you go after you leave the Site. The cookies track your computer, not you. They are not connected to any personal information about you. If you choose to disable a cookie, you may not be able to use certain features of the Site. PowerToFly uses cookies for authentication, to enable and support our security features and to help us detect malicious activity and violations of our Terms of Service. PowerToFly also uses cookies to learn about how the Site performs in different locations and to understand, improve, and research products, features and services. PowerToFly uses both persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie helps us recognize you as an existing User, to make it earlier for you to return to PowerToFly without signing in again. After you sign in, a persistent cookie stays in your browsers and will be read by PowerToFly when you return o the site. Session cookies only last for as long as a session in the Site (typically, the current visit to a web site or a browser session). 

### 3\. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.

3.1 Disclosure By Law; Protection of Us and Others. We may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law, at the request of a third party, or if we, in our sole discretion, believe that disclosure is reasonable to (1) comply with the law, requests or orders from law enforcement, or any legal process (whether or not such disclosure is required by applicable law), (2) protect or defend PowerToFly’s, or a third party's, rights or property, (3) protect someone's health or safety, such as when harm or violence against any person (including you) is threatened, or (4) enforce our Terms of Service. 

3.2 Permitted Disclosures. We may disclose information you provide: (1) if we have your consent, (2) where it is necessary to carry out your instructions, or (3) as reasonably necessary to provide our features and functionality to you.
