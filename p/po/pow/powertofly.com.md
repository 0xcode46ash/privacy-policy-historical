# Privacy Policy - PowerToFly

PowerToFly Inc. (“PowerToFly”, “we,” “us” or “our”) values your privacy. This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes the types of personal information we obtain through our website at www.powertofly.com (the “Site”), how we use the personal information we obtain and with whom we may share it.

**1\. COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Depending on what areas of the Site you use, we obtain different types of personal information from or about you. Our Site is available to talent looking for jobs (each a “Candidate”) and to prospective employers (each an “Employer”). We primarily obtain personal information about Candidates. In addition, we obtain certain personal information about Employers’ representatives who use the Site to find or hire Candidates. Please keep in mind that you may not be able to access some areas of the Site or effectively use the services we offer in connection with this Site without providing your personal information.

1.1 **Basic Account Information.** When you register for the Site as a Candidate or Employer, we will ask you to provide your name and email address or to sign up using an existing social media account.

1.2 **Candidates Profile Information.** If you are registering as a Candidate, we ask for information such as your phone number, Skype ID, photo, work history, educational background, location, biographical information and skills. We may ask you to voluntarily provide additional information about you, such as your race, gender and sexual orientation.

1.3 **Employers.** If you are registering as an Employer, we ask for an Employer’s representative phone number and job title in addition to the company name and size.

We use a third party, Stripe, to process payments made through payment cards on the Site. Stripe’s use of your personal information is governed by their privacy policy, which is available at <https://stripe.com/us/privacy>. We also may obtain your bank account number and routing number in order to make payments to your account.

1.6 **Cookies and Other Automated Means.** When you visit or use the Site, we and our service providers may automatically collect certain technical information from your browser or mobile device, including through cookies, log files and other technologies.

We may use cookies to improve your experience with the Site, by, for example, allowing the Site to keep you logged in. We may also use cookies to collect aggregate information about Site users.

_Interest-Based Advertising_

On our Site, we and third parties may collect information about your online activities to provide you with advertising about services or products tailored to your interests.

Ad networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs and web beacons. The information ad networks may collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the relevant advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites. This data collection takes place both on our Site and on third-party websites or apps that participate in the ad networks. This process allows us and third parties to deliver more tailored advertising.  In addition, it helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
