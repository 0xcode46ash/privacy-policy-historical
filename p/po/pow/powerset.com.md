# Privacy Policy - Powerset

## Powerset Privacy Policy

This privacy policy was last modified on May 8, 2008.

1\. Privacy Policy and Amendments. Powerset, Inc. ("Powerset") owns and operates Powerset.com and the services offered there (the "Service"). Powerset respects the privacy of its users. This document explains how Powerset will use the information that you provide to us via the Service. Powerset may amend this privacy policy from time to time. If Powerset does so, the revised privacy policy will be posted on the Service, and you will have the opportunity to modify your information on file with Powerset as explained below. 

2\. Posting. Users of the Service may post content, information, text, links, communications, software, images, video, audio, data, or other material (collectively, "User Content") on the Service. Any User Content may be saved on our servers and may be accessible to the public. Accordingly, to the extent that your User Content includes personally identifiable information, such information may be saved on our server(s) and may be disclosed to the public in perpetuity. 

3\. Personally Identifiable Information. "Personally Identifiable Information" is any piece of information which can be traced back to a specific individual user and thus potentially be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate that specific individual. Examples of Personally Identifiable Information include names, telephone numbers, social security numbers, and other unique identifiers. In no event will Powerset sell or transfer Personally Identifiable Information to third parties, or otherwise provide third parties with access thereto, except as specifically provided in this Privacy Policy and/or the Terms of Use. You are not required to provide personally identifiable information to visit and view the Service; however, in order to post User Content to the Service you must register as a Powerset participant ("Participant"), which may require that you provide personally identifiable information to Powerset to create your Participant account. If you register as a Participant, Powerset may store your account information, including personally identifiable information you enter into your account, your user name, and your password for the Service, on our server. In addition, Powerset may collect usage data and other information on all users, but usage data and other user information is not personally identifiable except as described below. 

4\. Cookies. Powerset may use Cookies on or in connection with the Service. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer's hard drive by our servers to identify your computer to our servers. Except as provided in Section 5, below, no personally identifiable information stored in the Powerset Cookies will be shared with outside companies for any purpose without your permission. You can also disable Cookies or otherwise manage them through tools provided with your browser software and with third-party software packages, or not use the features that require Cookies. 

Advertisers or other third parties may also use Cookies on the Service. The information advertisers or other third parties collect is governed by their own privacy policies. Powerset does not take responsibility for the content of such third-party privacy policies and does not guarantee that the third parties will comply with them. 

5\. Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Non-personally identifiable information is information that, by itself, cannot be tracked to a specific individual. Examples of non-personally identifiable information include, but are not limited to, the type of internet browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, your IP address, the time and date of your use of the Service, and whether or not you clicked on hypertext links within the Service. Powerset may collect non-personally identifiable information while you use the Service. 

Powerset may use non-personally identifiable information for administrative and analytical purposes, such as generating statistics and other user data. If Powerset provides any such information to others, Powerset will provide such information in the aggregate only and will not include any personally identifiable information about any individual Participants or other users. 

In cases of suspected abuse or service problems, Powerset may use an IP address in conjunction with personally identifiable information provided to Powerset to enforce the Terms of Use and/or to protect or troubleshoot the Service, its users or others who may be affected. Except as provided in Section 6, below, Powerset will not share personally identifiable information associated with IP addresses with third parties without your permission. 

6\. Sharing of Information. Powerset may share personally and non-personally identifiable information with third parties in the following cases: 

a. to enable the normal course of functionality of the Service. In some cases, Powerset may work with third parties that do analysis and development on our behalf. We may share your personally identifiable information with such a third party on the condition that the third party maintains the information as confidential and uses the information only to perform the services specified by Powerset; 

b. to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; 

c. to otherwise comply with the law or law enforcement requests; 

d. to enforce or determine violations of any Terms of Use or other Powerset policy; 

e. to protect the rights or property or safety of Powerset, its employees, or users; or 

f. in the event that Powerset is acquired by or merged with another company, in which case Powerset will transfer information about you to that other company. 

By providing Powerset your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. You may opt out or change the frequency of many Service-related communications by clicking the unsubscribe link in any email communication from Powerset. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features of the Service, or special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out by clicking the unsubscribe link in any email communication from Powerset. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers. 

7\. Security of Personal Information. We have implemented commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. You acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your own risk. 

To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from Powerset, at all times.

8\. Compromise of Personal Information. In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Powerset will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law. 

9\. Notification Procedures. It is the policy of Powerset to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to our customers, Participants, or other web site users via E-mail notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notices on our web site page, [http://www.powerset.com](http://www.powerset.com/ "Powerset"), as determined by Powerset in its sole discretion. Powerset reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our customers, Participants, or other web site users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy Policy. 

10\. Links to Other Sites. The Service contains links to media and other content from other sites. In addition, such third-party media and content may also contain external links. Powerset cannot and does not guarantee the privacy policies or practices of any third party. Powerset does not control, operate or endorse any information, products or services of any third-party website that may be reached through links from the Service. The use of any personal information provided to such a third party will be governed by that party's privacy policy. 

11\. Child Protection. We do not offer services to, or target, persons under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we will purge any information we receive from people we believe to be children under 13 from our database and cancel the corresponding accounts. 

12\. Your Choices About Your Information. You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through Powerset, in which case Powerset may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your account information [and email preferences] at any time by logging in to your account. You can review and correct the information about you that Powerset keeps on file by contacting us directly at [feedback@powerset.com](mailto:feedback@powerset.com).
