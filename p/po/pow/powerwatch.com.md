# Privacy Policy - PowerWatch – Home Energy Management System HEMS

PowerWatch is committed to protecting the privacy of personal information provided to us by our customers or visitors to our website. Since our Privacy Statement may change from time to time, we encourage you to visit our website or contact us to request a copy of the then-current PowerWatch Privacy Policy (please see our contact information below).

**How Personal Information is Collected**  
We know how important personal privacy is to our customers and visitors to our website. Whether you are browsing our website or you otherwise voluntarily submit information to us, we may be collecting personal information about you such as your name, address, telephone number or email address, and the internet address that identifies your computer. Personal information you provide us enables you to access customer services offered on our website and enables us to provide you with better information and service.

**Use of Your Personal Information**  
We may use your personal information to contact you to respond to your query or questions to us, or to keep you informed about us and our products and services. Except as we explain in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties without your prior written consent (which consent may be obtained electronically, such as by e-mail), unless we reasonably believe the disclosure is essential to the conduct of our business or to provide products or services to you. Examples of this might be when disclosure is necessary to (i) comply with the law, legal process or our regulators’ requirements, (ii) collect unpaid bills, (iii) enable our employees or consultants to provide service or information to you and otherwise perform their duties, or (iv) solve specific customer issues. We do not provide your personal information to third parties for telemarketing, e-mail or direct mail solicitation.

**Use of Cookies**  
Cookies are small text files placed on your computer’s hard drive by web page servers. When you visit our website, for example, our server may create “cookies”, making it easier for you to use our website by verifying when you move between pages of our website.

**Factors Beyond Our Control**  
While your personal privacy is very important to us, factors beyond our control make it impossible to always ensure that your personal information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, we may be legally obligated to disclose Customer Information to local, state or federal governmental agencies or third parties under certain circumstances (including in response to a subpoena), or, despite our best efforts, third parties may circumvent our security measures to unlawfully intercept or access your personal information. You may also link to one or more third party websites from our website, and we do not control and are not responsible for the collection of your personal information by third party websites that you link to from our website; you should consult and understand their privacy policies independently.

**Technical Problems**  
Even though we have taken significant steps to ensure that your personal information is not collected, used, or disclosed by us except as set forth by this Privacy Policy, technical mistakes are possible. If such a mistake occurs, we will take commercially reasonable steps to correct it.

**Access by Children**  
PowerWatch feels strongly that parents should be involved in supervising internet usage by their minor children. In any event, we do not monitor the age of visitors to our website. If you are under the age of eighteen, you should not submit your personal information to us without the consent of your parent or guardian.

**Contact PowerWatch**  
Our intention is to be diligent in protecting your personal privacy. If you would like to make suggestions or find out more about our privacy practices, please call us at 866-964-2046 or send us a letter or email at the addresses below.
