# PowerSchool

The Internet is a unique communications medium and PowerSchool is committed to protecting the privacy of users who utilize the PowerSchool student information system portal sites. PowerSchool fully discloses its policy about the collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and security of personally identifiable information obtained from users of our online services. PowerSchool is especially sensitive of the need for children to consult with their parents before furnishing personally identifiable information or ordering products online, and we make special efforts to advise children to do so. We also urge parents to monitor and supervise their children's online activities and use of software and other tools that may enhance their use. Throughout cyberspace, we want to contribute to providing a safe and secure environment for users of services. 

**SPECIAL ATTENTION TO KIDS**

PowerSchool takes special care to protect the safety and privacy of young people using our services. We do not collect personally identifiable information about children under the age of 13 and require that children under the age of 18 get their parents' consent before completing a child's registration with PowerSchool. 

PowerSchool does not rent, sell, exchange or share personally identifiable information with anyone else. The term "personally identifiable information" means information including, without limitation, name, address, telephone number, Social Security number, e-mail address, age or physical description.

PowerSchool uses personally identifiable information about its Web site users only in defined and responsible ways. When we gather personally identifiable information, we ask permission first. We also disclose, at the time of collection, how the information will be used by us.

PowerSchool complies with applicable law governing online privacy including the Child Privacy Protection and Parental Empowerment Act and the [Children Online Privacy Protection Act](https://web.archive.org/web/20011201023512id_/http%3A//powerschool.com/company/coppa.html). If you would like to review these laws and their related regulations we suggest you link to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's Web site at [http://www.ftc.gov](http://www.ftc.gov/) and [Kidz Privacy](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html).

PowerSchool would like to remind our customers about how to comply with federal laws applicable to school districts. Read more about the [Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)](https://web.archive.org/web/20011201023512id_/http%3A//powerschool.com/company/ferpa.html).

PowerSchool will collect personally identifiable information in relation to a users voluntary participation in PowerSchool promotional contests. Under these circumstances, you have the option to volunteer additional information, including but not limited to your e-mail address, mailing address and/or phone number for the purpose of notifying winners. Personally identifiable information may also be used for activities such as site registration, site membership, newsletter subscriptions and mailings that describe upcoming products, events and features. This information will never be rented, sold, exchanged or shared with third parties.

[PowerSchool.com](http://www.powerschool.com/) is a Web site for educators, parents and students where information about the company can be obtained and general educational resources can be accessed. On our Web site, users are able to request more information about PowerSchool, comment on the site, and apply for employment. We collect name, address telephone numbers and e-mail information to fulfill the specific requests of our site's users and may keep a record of the information for potential follow-up. We do not rent, sell, exchange or share this information to third parties.

Whenever possible, PowerSchool allows users to make choices about how their personally identifiable information will be used.

For all sites, we do gather log server data to use in the aggregate to analyze what features of the site are used most often by site users.

**Non-personally identifiable information collected by PowerSchool FOR THOSE SITES THAT HAVE ELECTED TO RAISE MONEY THROUGH SPONSORSHIP**

For those sites that have elected to raise money through sponsorship, PowerSchool does collect non-personally identifiable information about your computer, such as the server your computer is logged onto, your browser type (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer), and whether you responded to the ad delivered.

We use a technology called "cookies" to customize banner ads and promotions. Customization allows us to provide you with information tailored to your unique tastes and interests. This makes it even easier to find quickly the information that interests you the most. This non-personally identifiable information collected by PowerSchool is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of PowerSchool's sponsors. This information is only provided in the aggregate - meaning that it's about our site as a whole. We never distribute personally identifiable information about individual users.

To enable PowerSchool to compile meaningful reports for it's sponsors, Internet sites in general, including PowerSchool collect the following types of non-personally-identifiable information about users who are served advertisements by our sponsorships:

  * Your computer's IP address (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet). Information that PowerSchool can infer from the IP address includes the user's geographical location (not your address), company, and type and size of organization. 

  * Internet domain type being used (i.e., .com, .net, or .edu. )

  * Standard information included with every communication sent to the Internet. Information which PowerSchool can infer from this standard information includes your computer's browser version and type (i.e., Netscape or Internet Explorer), operating system (i.e., Windows or DOS), browser language (i.e., JAVA or UNIX), service provider (i.e., MindSpring or AOL), your local time, etc.

  * How you utilize the pages visited within a PowerSchool client's site (e.g. which pages you view).




We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements ON THIS AND OTHER SITES about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please [click here](http://www.sonar.com/content/privacy.htm).

**OTHER WEB SITES**

When users access the Internet whether through links from the PowerSchool Web site or otherwise, they access other Web sites not controlled by PowerSchool. PowerSchool is not responsible for those other Web sites, and we recommend users carefully examine the privacy statements of Web sites. Personally identifiable information that you choose to provide to other sites will be subject to the privacy policies of that Web site.

If you think that any sponsors, advertisers, or links on our Web site are inappropriate, please contact us immediately. Our address, telephone number and e-mail address can be found below.

**SECURITY**

The security or personally identifiable information is a high priority at PowerSchool. We maintain our Web site and all associated data with technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect against loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification and improper disclosure. PowerSchool uses industry-proven security procedures such as encrypted administrative communication and restricted access to hardware. No computer system or information can ever be fully protected against every possible hazard. Nonetheless, PowerSchool is committed to providing reasonable and appropriate security controls to protect our Web site and its information against foreseeable hazards. You may want to check with your local school to determine what safeguards they have in place to protect personally identifiable information on their systems.

PowerSchool might be required to disclose personally identifiable information in response to valid legal process. This includes a search warrant, subpoena or court order. In this respect, we are no different than any other record keeper. Disclosures also may be appropriate to protect the safety of a child, during emergencies if physical safety is believed to be at risk, to protect the security or integrity of our Web site, or to take precautions against liability. We think that these events are unlikely, but they are possible. PowerSchool will take reasonable steps to limit the scope of any of these disclosures.
