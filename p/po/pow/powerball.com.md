**PLAYER PRIVACY . . .**  
**Our Continued Commitment**

We at the Multi-State Lottery Association place your privacy at the utmost level of concern. We have always been committed to keeping your information safely stored within our systems. To ensure your trust, we have developed this privacy policy to help you understand both what information we collect and to whom it may be distributed. 

**COLLECTING INFORMATION  
**The Multi-State Lottery Association only collects the player-specific information that you specify on our e-mail signup page. Non player-specific information that is collected includes general usage information on our site (number of page accesses, frequency of page visits, number of unique visitors, etc.) and is used to enable us to provide the best quality of service possible. The Multi-State Lottery Association will also occasionally survey Multi-State Lottery Association website users for their opinions on new games, game changes and other matters of interest to lottery players. 

**MAINTAINING SECURITY PROCEDURES  
**The Multi-State Lottery Association maintains strict security procedures to protect the confidentiality of our visitor information. Our employees must abide by our privacy policies and have access to visitor information only for business purposes. If an employee is found in violation of our policy, disciplinary actions are taken. 

**SHARING INFORMATION AMONG AFFILIATES  
**Your information stays with us on our secured servers and will not be available to anyone outside of our immediate government lottery members.
