# Privacy Policy | Post Holdings

**Effective Date: September 30, 2013**  
Post Holdings, Inc. is concerned about online privacy issues. We want you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose any personal information that individually identifies you (e.g., your name, address, phone number, email address, etc.). This privacy policy explains our online information practices and the choices you, as a visitor to this site, can make about the collection and use of your information..

## What personal information do we collect?

We collect personally identifiable information from you (such as your name, address, phone number, email address, etc.) when you voluntarily provide it to us. We may use the information to communicate with you regarding our products, services, and promotions, to provide you with other information that you request, and/or to improve our product and service offerings. We do not require you to provide personally identifiable information to play our games.

If you contact one of our Consumer Affairs Representatives through our site, we may ask you for personal information such as your name, address, phone number, or email address so that we can respond to your questions or comments.

In addition, when you use our website, we may ask you to provide personal information if you:

  * register for a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion;
  * register as a user of our site;
  * register to receive coupons or recipes through our site;
  * join a club through our site;
  * participate in a recipe review, survey, a consumer research panel, or similar type of activity;
  * ask to receive online information such as recipes or material from us;
  * participate in our tell-a-friend option; or
  * otherwise participate in features of our website that ask for personal information.



If you purchase or otherwise request a product, publication or promotional offering from us or take advantage of a rebate or similar offer, you may be required to provide your contact and/or payment information (such as a credit card number) in order for us to process your request.

Your participation in any of these activities is voluntary. We may use the information you provide to respond to your questions or comments, to administer our promotions and sites, to fulfill your request, subscription, or order, or to otherwise provide or improve our products and services. We will not send you any online newsletter or similar email communication unless you expressly consent to receive such a communication from us. We may, however, send you notices of changes to our privacy policy. And if you do choose to receive any such email communication from us, you will always have the opportunity to unsubscribe from receiving the email at any time.

We reserve the right to disclose any personal information as needed if such information is requested by law enforcement agencies or if we are requested to do so by law, regulation, subpoena, court order or government entity.
