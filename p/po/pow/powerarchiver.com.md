We at ConeXware, Inc. are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us.

Further information about this program is available at [bbbonline.org](http://www.bbbonline.org/).

ConeXware has established this Privacy Policy so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your Personal Information.

Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether at work or at home. In general, you can visit ConeXware's Web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.

ConeXware strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, ConeXware intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy. Our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained.

ConeXware collects Personal Information when you place an order for one of our products, request support from ConeXware, sign up for a newsletter, or submit a PowerArchiver skin.

When you place an order for one of our products, ConeXware collects Personal Information as required to complete your order. This data includes your name, address, phone number, IP address and credit card details, depending on the payment method selected.

ConeXware sometimes collects limited non-personally identifying information your browser makes available whenever you visit a Web site. This log information includes your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your query and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. We use this information to operate, develop and improve our services.

When we require personally identifying information, we will inform you about the types of information we collect and how we use it. We hope this will help you make an informed decision about sharing your Personal Information with us.

Personal Information is strictly used for processing orders, or to contact you regarding a support request and newsletter update. Personal Information is not used for any other purposes.

When you place an order for PowerArchiver or other ConeXware products, our Web page utilizes "cookies" to uniquely identify your browser. A "cookie" is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a Web site. ConeXware uses cookies only to correctly identify you throughout the order process.

You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will not be able to place an order for a ConeXware product on our Web site.

We do not rent or sell your personally identifying information to other companies or individuals, unless we have your consent. We may share such information in any of the following limited circumstances:

  * We have your consent.
  * We provide such information to trusted businesses or persons for the sole purpose of processing personally identifying information on our behalf. When this is done, it is subject to agreements that oblige those parties to process such information only on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
  * We conclude that we are required by law or have a good faith belief that access, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of ConeXware, its users or the public.



In the event of a transfer of ownership of ConeXware, Inc., such as acquisition by or merger with another company, we will provide notice before any Personal Information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to ConeXware. The notice we intend to provide where ConeXware collects Personal Information on the Web should help you to make this choice. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of ConeXware's Web sites, but you will not be able to place an order or request support.

The PowerArchiver Release Newsletter is an opt-in e-mail newsletter to inform you when ConeXware products have been updated. You will not be contacted for any marketing purposes beyond software update notices. If you wish to unsubscribe, you can do so by visiting the [newsletters section](https://web.archive.org/newsletters/). 

ConeXware takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. We restrict access to your Personal Information to employees who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services.

To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, ConeXware wishes to maintain accurate Personal Information. Where we collect Personal Information from you on the Web, our goal is to provide a means of contacting ConeXware should you need to update or correct that Information. If for any reason those means are unavailable or inaccessible, you may [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact/) via e-mail with updates and corrections to your Personal Information.

If you wish to request access to, or review your Personal Information please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact/) via e-mail.
