_Last Updated 22 May 2002_

_This Privacy Notice will inform you as to what personal information PocketMail collects, in connection with your use of the PocketMail Service and how we use it and protect it in accordance with the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2001. We value your expectations for privacy and take care to protect, consistent with this Privacy Notice, the confidentiality and security of the information we collect from you and our subscribers_

  
  
  
This Privacy Notice applies to PocketMail Group Ltd. and its subsidiaries worldwide ("PocketMail"), our PocketMail Service, and our Web sites www.pocketmail.com, shop.pocket.com, my.pocket.com and localised national versions of those same Web sites published by us. It does not apply to any other Web site, or any company, entity, or person that is not under the direct or contractual control of PocketMail. 

"Personal information" means personally identifiable information such as your name, street address, telephone number, credit card information, screen name and e-mail address. PocketMail will not collect any personal information from your visits to the Web sites used with our Service unless you provide this information voluntarily. By subscribing to the PocketMail Service, you have agreed to provide this information. 

When you provide us with Personal Information, you are authorising us to use that information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Notice. If you have any questions or concerns regarding our use of your personal information, please see "Who to Contact" below. 

We collect personal information you submit during the initial registration process. We also collect payment information, including credit card information, in connection with your subscription or if you request any additional products or services for which payment is required. We also collect non-personally identifiable information from all users of the Service that allows us to understand how our Service is used, so that we may continually improve it, and to customise the features of the Service for our users. Please see "Do We Use Cookies?" below for more information. 

We use the registration information you submit in order to keep track of who our customers are, so that we may provide you the services you request, and so that we may contact you with offers of products or services in the future. If you submit credit card information, we use this information in order to process your payments and maintain our own financial records. We do not use your credit card information for any other purpose, or transmit it to anyone except our credit card processor, unless we are required to do so by law. 

We do not sell, rent, or give the personal information of our subscribers to any company not affiliated with us. Other companies that perform services for us may have access to your personal information from time to time, but we contractually require these companies to keep such information confidential and not to use it for any other purpose than to perform the service for which they have been retained. 

We may aggregate information you provide in a manner that does not disclose any personally identifiable information and provide that information, in aggregated form, to one or more advertisers, service partners or other businesses. In no event will that aggregated information be sufficient to allow you to be personally identified, either alone or in combination with any other information that may exist about you. 

Certain features of our Service, such as e-mail sent to your e-mail address may also serve to notify us when the message itself is opened. This enables us to measure the effectiveness and improve the delivery of these and other features of our Service. None of these files transmit any additional information to us. By using the Service, you agree to receive e-mails from us and to permit the collection of this information. 

We may also collect information about your PocketMail device, such as the e-mail address and the unique identification number associated with that device, and information about any computer you use to access our Web sites, such as your IP address (a number assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Internet), the type of Internet browser you are using and the type of computer operating system you are using. This information is used to manage the security and efficiency of our Service and in connection with measuring the effectiveness of certain advertisements and services. We also use your personal information in connection with your use of our Service in order to better understand how our Service is used, so that we may continually improve it, and to customise the features of the Service for you. 

This issue does not apply to the use of PocketMail devices, however it may apply to your use of Web browsers to access our Web sites. Cookies are small files or pieces of information that are stored by your Web browser on your computer's hard drive, or, if you access the Web via a mobile phone, in a temporary directory on your WAP service providers' network servers. Cookies do not damage or harm your computer or your mobile phone in any way. 

We may use cookies to collect information during your visit to our Web sites (on a non-personally identifiable basis), such as the particular site areas you visit and the products or services you obtain through the Service. We collect this information to better tailor the Service and our products to the interests and needs of our users. Cookies may also be used to help speed up your future activities with the Service; the computer can remember that you have already provided personal information and service preferences, and not request that you provide these a second time. 

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, your refusal of the use of cookies with our Service may limit your ability to use certain features or to receive personalised information during your use of the Service. 

We maintain physical and technical security measures at our facilities to ensure that no one obtains access to personal information that does not have a legitimate reason to do so. When we collect credit card information, we do so by means of a secure server using Secured Sockets Layer ("SSL"). SSL is a type of encryption that encodes your credit card information while it is in transit to us so that it is very difficult to intercept and read. We may upgrade the type of security measures we use from time to time, as technology and threats to security change. 

  
The personal information records we collect are part of our business operations and assets. In the event that we sell or transfer the ownership or operation of the Service to a third party, that transaction may include the transfer of our records containing your personal information. However, in that situation, we will contractually assure that the party to whom the business is sold or transferred may only use your personal information in a manner consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

We are unlikely to make frequent changes to the ways we collect, use and disclose personal information. However, we reserve the right to change our privacy practices at any time. If we do make any significant change to how we use personal information, notice of that change will be prominently posted in this area of our Web site. We encourage you to check this page regularly in order to stay informed if we make any changes that may affect you. 

You may access, correct and update the personal information that we hold about you. We encourage you to let us know if there are any errors in your personal information and to advise us of changes to the information. To ensure the integrity and safety of your personal information, we will only disclose such information if our internal procedures are satisfied. If you have any questions or concerns regarding our collection, use or disclosure of your personal information, please contact PocketMail Customer Service via the e-mail, telephone or fax contact information listed under "Contact us" in the Company section of this Web site. We always appreciate your feedback because it helps us to continually improve our service to our customers.
