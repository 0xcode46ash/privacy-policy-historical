# Poodwaddle Privacy Policy

_Do unto others as you would have done to you._

The golden rule makes a pretty darn good privacy policy. At Poodwaddle.com (and our sister site AskYuki.com) we value your privacy. We don't sell, use, or even ask for your personal info. We don't track your habits or tell your mommy what you have been up to. But, of course, there are situations where some non-personal data is gathered and stored for the sake of site operations... that is, for site functions such as saving your settings. 

Like many other Web sites, www.poodwaddle.com makes use of log files. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol ( IP ) addresses, type of browser, Internet Service Provider ( ISP ), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement around the site, and gather demographic information. IP addresses, and other such information are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. We don't really use log files... they are just generated by our host... but we thought we would tell you anyway. 

Poodwaddle.com does not use cookies to store your info, but we do use "flash cookies" which essentially save your settings and preferences on your computer, not on our site. Other aplets, such as the Message in a Bottle, do have to use server side databases to store the info you send. This info is never shared or used for any other purpose. We will never email you or offer your address to someone else.
