**Privacy Statement**

PoolHost.com collects some personal information during the registration process. This information is NOT shared with any individual or company that is not associated or affiliated with PoolHost.com. PoolHost.com does NOT sell or trade e-mail addresses to any organizations and does NOT make such information available to companies that send SPAM.

So why do we collect personal information?  We collect demographic info during registration from users to get site wide data that can be helpful in securing sponsorship for our site.  Sponsors help us cover costs so we can provide our service for free.  We only share the site wide data about our user base as a whole like the percentage of male to female, average age groups, etc.  We never share personal data for individual users which means your email address and any data specific to you stays PRIVATE.

Users have the option of making their e-mail addresses available to be seen by other system users. In choosing to do so, this information may become available to visitors of PoolHost.com, especially in the case of members of Public Pools. Users who make this information visible and who only participate in Private Pools will be making this information available only to members of the Private Pools they are in.

With respect to Ad Servers: To try and bring you offers that are of interest to you, we have relationships with other companies that we allow to place ads on our Web pages. As a result of your visit to our site, ad server companies may collect information such as your domain type, your IP address and clickstream information. For further information, consult the privacy policies of:

CPX Interactive: <http://www.cpxinteractive.com/privacy_policy.htm>  
Advertising.com: <http://www.advertising.com/abt_privacy.php>  
24/7 Real Media: <http://www.247realmedia.com/privacy.html>

Sensitive data for online transactions collected directly on our site is NOT kept in our servers.  It is only used to execute the transaction and then discarded.  We do this to protect your privacy.  In the unlikely event that we suffer a security breach, we will not have any of your sensitive transaction data in our database.

PoolHost.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Should this policy change in such a way as to make some information available outside of PoolHost.com, users would be notified and allowed to opt out of such information sharing first.
