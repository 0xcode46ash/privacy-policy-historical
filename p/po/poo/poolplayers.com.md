# APA Privacy Policy

American Poolplayers Association (APA) Online Privacy Policy

What personally identifiable information does APA collect from me?

APA collects information in several ways from different parts of our Web sites. Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, APA asks for your name, e-mail address, and other personal information. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to APA - you are given an APA ID and are able to take full advantage of APA's many offerings. 

APA also occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for internal research. Wherever APA collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page. 

What are cookies and how does APA use them?

As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services to its Web site visitors, APA uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. All sites on APA where you are prompted to log-in or that are customizable require that you accept cookies.

Generally, we use cookies to remind us of who you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or "Sign In" and is modified when you "Sign Out" of our services.

How does APA use my information?

APA's primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our sites. This includes personalization services, interactive communications and other types of services, which are completely free to you. 

Who is collecting information?

When you are on an APA site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with APA. APA does not distribute its e-mail list.

Please be aware that APA advertisers or Web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those Web sites linked to APA are not covered by this privacy statement. 

With whom does APA share my information?

As a general rule, APA will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. 

What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, APA cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
