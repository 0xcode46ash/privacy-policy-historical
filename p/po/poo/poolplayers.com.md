# APA Privacy Policy

American Poolplayers Association (APA)   
Online Privacy Policy

This Web Site Privacy Policy is effective on September 27, 2005 . 

This American Poolplayers Association web site (the “Site”) is a service of the American Poolplayers Association, Inc., a Missouri corporation ("APA" or “we”). This Web Site Privacy Policy applies only to information that we collect from this Site. This Web Site Privacy Policy does not apply to other information that we may collect including, without limitation, information that we may collect from any email messages and associated information that you may send to addresses published on this website. 

**Data Collection**

We collect "personally identifiable information" and "automatic information." 

"Personally identifiable information" is information that tells us who you are, such as your name, your postal address, and your e-mail address. We collect personally identifiable information only if you voluntarily choose to provide it to us. We may associate automatic information with your personally identifiable information. In the event of such association, such automatic information will be considered personally identifiable information. Personally identifiable information does not include aggregate information that, by itself, does not allow for the identification of an individual person.

“Automatic information” is information automatically collected by our web server (which may be hosted by a third-party) that your web browser makes available whenever you visit our Site. This information may include your Internet Protocol address, the identity of your internet service provider, the type of browser that you use, and the date and time of your visit. An Internet Protocol address is a number assigned to your computer when you connect to the Internet.

Our Site also uses “cookies.” A “cookie” is a small amount of data that is sent to your computer from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. When you initially visit our Site, a “cookie” is sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. The cookie is read by us each time you visit our Site. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some portions of our Site may not function properly without cookies.

**Information Use and Sharing**

We use personally identifiable information for the purposes for which it was collected. For example, to the extent that we collect personally identifiable information for membership registration, we will use such information in connection with, among other things, providing you with membership services which may include the creation of a membership directory which may be provided to others. 

In addition to using personally identifiable information for the purposes for which it was collected, we may also use personally identifiable information to send you publications, invitations and other marketing materials that may be of interest to you. 

We may share your personally identifiable information with third parties including, without limitation, affiliated entities, and third parties performing services for or on our behalf (such as communications, event management, and/or marketing services). 

We may disclose personally identifiable information when we reasonably believe that the law requires it, and/or when we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to, or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally), our rights or property, other users of this Site, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. 

We might sell or buy subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, personally identifiable information may be one of the transferred business assets. 

We use non-personally identifiable information to help us run and maintain the Site, study traffic patterns and generally learn about the usage of the Site. We may also use such information for purposes of system administration, to improve the design and content of the Site, and/or to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We may disclose non-personally identifiable information to third parties including advertisers, business partners, and sponsors, to analyze site usage and manage and improve our business relationships.
