PokerRoom.com offers you a wide range of secure depositing options.

Since we've been in the business for so long, we have had the time to identify the best partners in the industry – and we work only with them. We use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol that encrypts all data. The credit card processing at PokerRoom.com is handled by Montreal-based [Optimal Payments](http://www.optimalpayments.com/), a publicly traded company with many years of experience as one of the leading credit card processing companies on the Internet. This guarantees the security of all online transactions here at PokerRoom.com – and we handle thousands of them every day.

More about the security here at PokerRoom.com can be found in the [SECURITY](https://web.archive.org/about/#Security) section.

At PokerRoom.com, each player's cards are sent exclusively to that particular player's computer – the cards can therefore not be viewed from anywhere else. All game activities are logged and saved in PokerRoom.com's database. We are therefore able to analyze the hands in the game log, and search for suspicious playing patterns.

Management will thoroughly investigate all possible complaints registered by players suspecting collusion. Hand history transcripts are available for all players and will show the exact betting of each game and the final hands of all players that called the river card. Any player that attempts to collude at PokerRoom.com will be permanently banned from our games.

As an extra security measure, it is not possible for two players with the same IP number (on the same computer or same network) to play at the same table.

The PokerRoom.com [support staff](https://web.archive.org/support/) are always available when collusion activities are suspected.

In order to live up to the word 'secure' in our company mission, several measures have been taken. One of them is PokerRoom.com’s use of Thawte SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) Certificates that offers secure communications by encrypting all data to and from the site. Another is the fact that PokerRoom.com is licensed by the [Kahnawake Gaming Commission](http://www.kahnawake.com/gamingcommission/) – Kahnawake being the place of the PokerRoom.com servers.

In order for our players to be able to manage their gaming activity on PokerRoom.com we have developed new procedures and introduced many new features in co-operation with the [Global Gambling Guidance Group (G4)](http://www.gx4.com/).

Together with G4, PokerRoom.com has developed a system where a player can set his or her own daily, weekly or monthly limits for deposits. G4 has also verified PokerRoom.com’s self assessment test, where a player can get fast information regarding his or her possible problems when it comes to gambling.

The [support staff](https://web.archive.org/support) at PokerRoom.com can be contacted at any time and will be able to assist you in the right direction for assistance if you are worried that a loved one may be addicted to gambling.
