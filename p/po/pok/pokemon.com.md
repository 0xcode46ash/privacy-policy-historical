## Online Privacy Policy

Welcome to Pokemon.com.  We want you to know that Pokemon.com is very concerned with the privacy rights of its online visitors and are committed to protecting the information collected about you.  To further this commitment, we have adopted an Online Privacy Policy that guides how we collect, store, and use the information you provide.       

This Privacy Policy Statement and the certification seal located on this page confirms that Pokemon.com is a valid licensee and participating member in the [Entertainment Software Rating Board's Privacy Online Program: ESRB Privacy Online](http://www.esrb.org/).  To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative and all of our websites have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Online to meet established online information collection and use practices.  As part of this privacy program, we are subject to frequent audits of our sites and other enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by the ESRB. 

**If you have any questions, complaints or comments regarding our privacy policy or practices, please send an email to[feedback@pokemon-usa.com](mailto:feedback@pokemon.com) or address written correspondence to:**

The Privacy Policy currently applies to the following websites operated by Pokemon.com:

www.pokemon.com 

From time to time, Pokemon.com may add new websites to the list above, so please check back with us periodically. 

Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted and collected online through the website(s) listed above, and does not apply to information that may be collected by Pokemon.com offline.  In addition, this Privacy Policy applies only to sites maintained by Pokemon.com and not to websites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link.  Pokemon.com is therefore not responsible for the content or activities provided on such sites. 

**What information does Pokemon.com collect and how it will be used?**

Pokemon.com does not collect personal information from you when you visit our site.  The only information we collect from you directly is demographic in nature and usually will take the form of a survey or a user login (e.g., Pokemon Community). 

**Does Pokemon.com use cookies, track IP addresses or use other passive means to collect information?**

Pokemon.com uses cookies on its website.  Cookies are small pieces of information that are transferred and stored on your computer’s hard drive, not on our site.  Cookies do not spy on you or otherwise invade your privacy, and they cannot invade your hard drive and steal information.   In addition, cookies do not collect or store any personal information about you.  Rather, they help you navigate a website as easily as possible.  Pokemon.com uses cookies to prevent you from having to reenter your registration data (e.g., password) at each connection.  If your browser does not support cookies, or you have disabled cookies on your browser, you will not be able to take advantage of these timesaving features. 

Pokemon.com does not keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.  An IP address is a numeric address that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider.  Your IP address is typically used to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.

The only other information collected by Pokemon.com is in the form of log files that record website activity, including how many “hits” a particular web page is getting.  We also use the log file entries for our own internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you.  Log files are used internally only, and are not associated with any particular user, computer or browser.

**Who is collecting my information?**

The demographic information that you disclose while visiting our websites (listed above) is collected by Pokemon.com and is used in the manner specified above. 

**With whom does Pokemon.com share my information?**

From time to time, Pokemon.com may employ entities to provide support for the internal operations of Pokemon.com website(s).  If we do employ third parties for internal support purposes, Pokemon.com requires that those third parties take adequate and appropriate measures to assure the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the shared information.

Pokemon.com does not disclose any information to outside third parties.  This policy, however, does not apply when Pokemon.com is required to disclose information to law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation or fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability.  In addition, in the event of a merger, acquisition, or the unlikely event of bankruptcy, the information maintained by Pokemon.com may be transferred to its successor or assign.

**What is Pokemon.com’s policy regarding links to other sites?**

You should be aware that while you are on a website operated by Pokemon.com, you may be directed to other sites that are beyond our control and for which we are not responsible.  Because we cannot guarantee that the privacy policies of these websites meet our high standards and the requirements of the ESRB Privacy Online Program, we recommend that you read the privacy policy of the website to which you link before you submit any personal information.

**What safeguards does Pokemon.com use to protect my information?**

Pokemon.com maintains appropriate safeguards that ensure the security of the information we collect.  Information collected by Pokemon.com is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public and is only accessible by authorized employees (e.g., firewall protected server).

**How do I ask a question or file a complaint?**

If you have any questions, complaints, or comments regarding our Privacy Policy or practices, please contact us via email at feedback@pokemon-usa.com or address written correspondence to:
