## 1\. What information does this Privacy Policy cover?

This Privacy Policy applies only to personal information collected on the Site where this Privacy Policy is posted, and, unless Pokémon specifies otherwise in writing, does not apply to any other information collected by Pokémon through any other means.

Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted and collected online, and does not apply to information that may be collected by Pokémon offline.

This demographic information may be associated with your personal information.

### Information Collected Through Technology

We collect information through technology to make our Site more interesting and useful to you. For example, when you come to one of our Site, we collect your IP address. An IP address is often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet Service Provider), your company, or your university. At times, we also use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our Site. We may combine this information with personally identifiable information.

### Location Based Information

We may collect and store your device’s source IP address which may disclose the location of your device at the time you access the Site. Advertisements and certain content could be directed to you as a result of this data. In addition, in some cases the Site can deliver content based on your current location if you choose to enable that feature. If you enable that feature, your current location will be stored locally on your device which will be used by the Site to serve you certain content tied to your location. If you elect to have your location-based searches saved to your history, we will store such information on our servers (collectively, all location based information collected by Pokémon is “Location Information”). You always may disable these features or withdraw your consent to providing your Location Information. However, if you prefer not to disclose Location Information, you will not be able to enjoy certain features of our Site.

### Cookies

Our Site also use cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a Site sends to your computer while you are viewing the Site. We and other companies use cookies for a variety of purposes. For example, when you return to one of our Site after logging in, cookies provide information to the Site so that the Site will remember who you are. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You can do this through your browser (like Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your experience smoother, like the features mentioned above, and some of our services may not function properly.

### Web Beacons and Log Files

Our Site use a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including Web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of various sites. We also use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our Site, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our Site. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. Our Site use log files to record which pages visitors to our site accessed, how long they stayed on the site, where they came from and other data. We also use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that we send our guests to determine whether our guests have opened those e-mails or clicked on links in those e-mails. The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is personally identifiable.

Finally, once you've clicked on an advertisement or other link and have left our Site, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the host of that site to see how your personal information will be handled on their site.

## 3\. How is your personally identifiable information used and shared?

We don't share, sell, or rent your personal information to third parties without your prior consent. We don't require personal information to access our Site. However, if you prefer not to disclose personal information, you will not be able to enjoy certain features of our Site.

Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives.

Information provided in order to create an account, payment information, and other account data is passed through to our vendors, who provide back-end fulfillment and other services for our Site. We do not retain any credit card data, all of which is stored by Authorize.net.

### Pokémon Online Tools and Events

For example, if you register on our Site, your information will be used to provide you the benefits associated with registration. In addition, if you participate in a game, contest, sweepstakes, or other similar event ("promotion"), the information provided in connection with the promotion will be used to determine your entry eligibility, to contact you with the results, and for prize fulfillment purposes.

### Message Boards, Comments, and Reviews

If you register for access to our message boards or chat rooms, we will use your personal information to enable you to view and post messages on the boards. However, you should understand that community forums and message boards are tools that allow you to communicate with members of the online community. That's why whenever you give out personal information online in public areas, that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. Any review that you submit may be posted on the Site, so you should not submit any information in a review that you do not want to share with the general public.

### Operational Uses

We may also use your personal information for other purposes such as "Operational Uses." For example, we may use your information to send you administrative communications either about your account with us or about features of our Site, including any future changes to this Privacy Policy.

We may use your personal information to fulfill your requests and orders for products and services or to communicate with you regarding such request and orders.

### Outside Vendors

Pokémon may share your personal information with other companies and individuals we hire to support our internal operations and to provide services on our behalf, including fulfilling orders, payment processing, sending postal mail and email, technical support, customer service, and delivering packages. For example, Amazon.com, Inc., and its affiliates, and venders will receive your personal information, including your name, address, and credit card information, in order to create your account and process and fulfill your orders for products. In the course of providing such services, these companies may have access to your personally identifying information. These entities have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of all the personal information they obtain from us.

### Use of Your Location Information

We may only use and share your Location Information in conjunction with our right described in “Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Site and Others” below and to:

We also may use and/or combine information that we collect off-line to enhance, expand, and check the accuracy of your customer records. For example, we may combine information or data that we collect through your purchases on PokemonCenter.com with information or data we collect from your activity on Pokemon.com and off-line.

### Aggregate Information

Finally, we may take your personally identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information). Given the nature of this information, no restrictions apply under this Privacy Policy on our right to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information, and we may use and share in any way with third parties the resulting non-personally identifiable information.

If we purchase a business, the personally identifiable information received with that business would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do so.

### Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Site and Others

We will disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that such disclosures (a) are required by law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena, or (b) will help to: enforce our Terms of Use; enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game rules; protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of property that belongs to you; and/or, protect the safety and security of our Site or third parties.

## 4\. How Long Do We Keep Your Personally Identifiable Information?

Pokémon will keep your personal information so long as you have an account with Pokémon, provided, however, that Pokémon will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete any personal information collected by Pokémon that is no longer relevant to your use of the Site or the Services offered by Pokémon. Information passed through to our vendors may be retained in accordance with each vendor's individual privacy policy.

## 5\. What choices do you have about the collection, use, and sharing of your personally identifiable information?

As mentioned above, you have control over the personal information you submit to us. If at any time you decide to remove your personal information from our database, you may do so by contacting us at The Pokémon Company International, Inc., Attention: Pokémon Center Privacy Policy Administrator, 601 108th Avenue NE, Suite 1600, Bellevue, WA 98004.

## 6\. What kinds of security measures do we take to safeguard your personally identifiable information?

The security and confidentiality of your personal information is extremely important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and improper use. To prevent unauthorized electronic access to personal information, we limit access to only those employees performing a legitimate business function; maintain information collected online behind a firewall-protected server; verify your identity by asking you for an email address or by other means; store your personal information on servers separate from other corporate information and systems; and notify you by email if we learn that a breach has occurred. We also collect personal information from you only on SSL-protected (encrypted) web pages and it is transmitted over the Internet only through an SSL-protected (encrypted) channel. From time to time, we review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technology and methods. However, please understand that, despite our best efforts, no security measure is perfect or impenetrable.
