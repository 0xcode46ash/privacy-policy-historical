### 1\. General information

All features on the Poki site are available without the need for registration by Users. No personal data (such as email addresses and phone numbers) are collected. Poki will collect certain electronic data (such as the User’s IP address, cookies or device ID).  
When a User clicks to leave the Poki Site, Poki may try to inform the User that they are leaving the Poki Site and that this Privacy Policy will no longer apply. When a User provides personal data on any third party website or application, the processing of such personal data will be governed by any privacy statement applicable to that site/application. In any event, Poki shall not act as the Data Controller or the Processor of such personal data.

### 2\. Data collection and its purposes

Our servers automatically recognize visitors’ domain names and IP addresses (the number assigned to computers on the Internet). The Poki site may gather anonymous “traffic data” that does not personally identify you, but that data may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer.  
When your computer or mobile device contacts our web servers (for example, when you visit the Poki site), our web servers automatically collect usage information. Such usage information includes information about how our visitors use and navigate the Poki site. It can include the number and frequency of visitors to each web page and the length of their stays, browser type, referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting our Site, and IP addresses.

We may use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, to help administer the Poki site, or to display the content according to your preferences. Traffic information may also be shared with business partners and advertisers on an aggregate and anonymous basis. More information about sharing information will follow in part 7.  
In addition, Advertisers on the Poki General Site might use information gathered by the use of cookies for targeted advertising purposes. Further information regarding the use of cookies can be found below.

### 7\. Children Users

We recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of children and encourage parents to check and monitor their children’s use of online activities regularly. This is why we created a separate age-appropriate experience for Children Users through the Poki Kids Site.

The Poki Kids Site supports and complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). No personal information is purposefully or knowingly collected from Children Users on the Poki Kids Site. There is no registration required for the Poki Kids Site and any advertising shown on the site is age-appropriate. The Poki Kids Site will not show behaviorally targeted ads or allow third parties to track the activity of Children Users for that purpose.

The Poki Kids Site may collect and use IP addresses and other persistent identifiers from Children Users, but only for purposes of supporting our internal operations, such as to help us:

  * Maintain or analyze the functioning of the Poki Kids Site
  * Perform network communications
  * Authenticate users of, or personalize the content on, the Poki Kids Site
  * Serve contextual advertising on the Poki Kids Site and cap the frequency of advertising



If you are a Child User, you should only use the Poki Kids Site and only with the permission of a parent or legal guardian. If Poki ever becomes aware of the collection of personal information from a Child User, we will purge that information from our system immediately.

To learn more about COPPA, please reference this simple one-page informational guide from the kidSAFE Seal Program: <http://www.kidsafeseal.com/knowaboutcoppa.html>.

### 8\. Revisions to this Privacy Policy

We may change this privacy policy from time to time to accommodate new technologies, industry practices, regulatory requirements or for other purposes. If we update this policy, changes will be reflected on this page and we will update the “last updated” date above.  
We will obtain prior parental consent for any changes we make if those changes affect Children Users in a way that requires parental consent under COPPA.
