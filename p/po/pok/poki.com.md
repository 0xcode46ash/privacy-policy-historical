# Privacy Policy | Poki

This Privacy Policy was last updated on June 17, 2016.

This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to provide transparency into Poki’s privacy practices and principles.

Poki offers games and content for children of all ages, including those under 13. Poki is committed to protecting the privacy of children who use our sites and applications. This Privacy Policy explains our information collection and disclosure with respect to information provided by children under the age of 13. This policy is in accordance with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and the guidelines for the Children’s Advertising Review Unit (“CARU”). This Privacy Policy applies to Poki’s web portal Poki.com and all applications available on smartphone devices and tablets (together, the “Works”). Poki.com (hereinafter the “Website”) is a property of Poki B.V. (“Poki”). Poki respects the privacy concerns of all users of its Works.

By using the Works you agree to observe and be bound by this Privacy Policy and you consent to the processing, collection, use and disclosure of your information and data in accordance with its terms. Please do not use the Works if you do not agree to this Privacy Policy. If you are a parent or legal guardian, by allowing your child to use the Works, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy on your child’s behalf.

If you have any questions concerning this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [privacy@poki.com](mailto:privacy@poki.com). A simplified summary of our Privacy Policy can be found [here](http://poki.com/company/privacy-policy-summary/).

## **1\. General information**

All features on the Website are available without registration to users of all ages, including children under the age of 13. No personal data (such as email addresses and phone numbers) is collected. Poki will collect certain electronic data (such as the user’s IP address, cookies or device ID). 

We recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of children and encourage parents to check and monitor their children’s use of online activities regularly. The Website supports and complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and other applicable laws for all users in the United States. No personally identifiable information is purposefully or knowingly collected from children under the age of 13 by Poki. If you are under the age of 13, you should use this Website only with the permission of a parent or legal guardian.   
  
In case the user is leaving the Website, Poki will try to inform the user that they are leaving the Website and the protection of its Privacy Policy.

In any event, Poki shall not act as the Data Controller or the Processor of such personal data.

## **2.  Data collection and its purposes**

Our servers automatically recognize visitors’ domain names and IP addresses (the number assigned to computers on the Internet). The Website may gather anonymous “traffic data” that does not personally identify you, but that data may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer.

When your computer or mobile device contacts our web servers (for example, when you visit the Website), our web servers automatically collect usage information. Such usage information includes information about how our visitors use and navigate our Website. It can include the number and frequency of visitors to each web page and the length of their stays, browser type, referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting our Site, and IP addresses.   
  
We may use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our site, or to display the content according to your preferences. Traffic information may also be shared with business partners and advertisers on an aggregate and anonymous basis. More information about sharing information will follow in part 7.

We only use IP addresses and other persistent identifiers as defined under the exceptions in COPPA, to support internal operations, specifically to:

  * Maintain or analyze the functioning of the Website
  * Perform network communications
  * Authenticate users of, or personalize the content on, the Website
  * Serve contextual advertising on the Website and cap the frequency of advertising



In addition, Advertisers on the Website might use information gathered by the use of cookies for advertising purposes. Further information regarding the use of cookies can be found below.
