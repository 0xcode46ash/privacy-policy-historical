# Lulu Poetry Privacy Policy

### What this Privacy Pledge covers:

This privacy pledge covers how Lulu Poetry treats personal information that we collect and receive, including information related to your use of Lulu Poetry services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.

At Lulu Poetry, we value our customers and respect their privacy. When you register, we may collect personal information in an effort to improve your overall experience. Once you register and sign in to Lulu Poetry, you are not anonymous to us. Lulu Poetry may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies in order to provide services you have requested from us. We do not purchase any personal data from other companies.

Lulu Poetry may collect usage information when you visit our site. Website usage information is not personally identifiable information. It describes how our website is used and navigated, including the number and frequency of visitors to each web page and the length of their stay. It also includes the domain names of users and browser types that visit our website, the time of day the website was visited, and other non-personally identifiable information.

Lulu Poetry automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, browser settings, and pages requested. Lulu Poetry also requires a cookie, used only to keep track of your login status.

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. Lulu Poetry will set and access Lulu Poetry cookies on your computer. The information stored by our cookies is linked only to your email and password. We do not link other personally identifiable information you provide to cookies. Lulu Poetry uses session ID cookies to ensure that you are recognized when you move from page to page within Lulu Poetry. These cookies are deleted when you close your browser. You can manually delete cookies at any time by following the directions given in your Internet browser’s Help file. If you reject cookies, you will only be able to browse the site. Lulu Poetry uses information for the following general purposes:

  * To fulfill your requests for products and services
  * To improve our services
  * To contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients



At the registration stage, you also have the opportunity to opt-in to news and updates from Lulu Poetry. If you choose to opt-in, we may send you email communications such as newsletters and special site updates.

Whether or not you opt-in to news and updates from us, there are still certain (very rare) types of email communications you will receive from Lulu Poetry. These communications include site-critical announcements, changes to our Member Agreement, and any other communication it is necessary for all of our members to receive.

Lulu Poetry takes reasonable precautions to safeguard information transmitted between users and the websites. Certain pages of the websites, including those that offer users the opportunity to provide credit card information for purchases, use Secured Socket Layers (SSL) encryption. However, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open communications network, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and Lulu Poetry and information stored on our servers will be free from unauthorized access. Users understand and acknowledge this risk when communicating with and providing information to the Site. Verisign LogoVerisign provides authentication that you are communicating over a secure connection with Lulu Poetry.

We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Lulu Poetry under confidentiality agreements. These companies may only use your data as directed by Lulu Poetry. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information, nor do they have any right to contact you for matters not pertaining to Lulu Poetry.

Otherwise, Lulu Poetry does not share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies, and we only share your personal information with third parties in the following circumstances:

  * We may disclose your personal information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, or as otherwise required by law
  * We may disclose your personal information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Lulu Poetry’s terms of use
  * We share information about you if Lulu Poetry or Lulu.com is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Lulu Poetry will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy pledge.



If you include your personal information in content that you upload for posting on Lulu Poetry, that information may be widely available to other users. We do not exercise control over those users and cannot guarantee that your personal information will be protected as described in this Privacy Pledge if you make it available as part of content posted on Lulu Poetry. We do not delete or redact your personal information from content you provide. If you do not want your personal information to be displayed as part of the content you share, then you must delete it prior to sharing it.

Lulu Poetry will transfer personal information about you to other countries where Lulu Poetry does business. In particular, Lulu will transfer personal information from the EU to the United States for the purposes of providing users in the EU with the services Lulu Poetry offers. Although other countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country where you reside, Lulu Poetry will apply the terms of this Privacy Pledge to all personal information that it collects.

  * You can edit your account information at any time. Certain communications from Lulu Poetry, such as critical service announcements and administrative messages, are considered part of Lulu Poetry membership and you may not opt out of receiving them.
  * You may correct, update, delete, or deactivate personal information by contacting us [here](mailto:help@poetry.com), or at the mailing address listed below.
  * We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
  * We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you.
  * Your Lulu Account Information is password-protected. You are responsible for not sharing your password.



If you have any questions about our privacy policy or information security, you can contact Lulu Poetry by emailing help@poetry.com

Lulu Poetry may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address you have provided us or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
