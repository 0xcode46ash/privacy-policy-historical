### Right to Opt In and Opt Out

You have the right to “opt-in” and “opt-out” of certain of our uses of your Personal Information. For example, you may elect not to receive correspondence from us or have your Personal Information shared with other entities for their marketing purposes. If you do not want to receive any promotional correspondence, you may request to be removed from our email list. Send an e-mail to [heather@poetsandquants.com](mailto:heather@poetsandquants.com) requesting removal from the Site’s email distribution list. You may also delete your registered user account on the Site.

Please understand that if you opt-out of receiving promotional correspondence from us, we may still contact you in connection with your relationship, activities, transactions and communications with us.

We may allow third-parties to display advertisements on our Site. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. These third parties may collect information about whether you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver (such as click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, etc.), and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies and provides information about this behavioral advertising practice ( [www.networkadvertising.org ](http://www.networkadvertising.org/)). You may opt out of our collection of data for use by third party ad companies to provide targeted advertising to you of our products as you visit other sites. Cookies are unique to each computer. Therefore, you must opt out separately on all computers you use. If you delete all of your cookies (specifically, the “Out-Out” cookie), you will have to go through the opt-out process again to reactivate your opted-out status.
