Your privacy is a serious matter to us. This Privacy Policy represents our commitment to you to be completely transparent. It outlines the type of information, personal and otherwise, that is collected through this website and how that information is used and protected.

You have the right to “opt-in” and “opt-out” of certain of our uses of your personal information. For example, on this website, you may be able to elect to or not to receive correspondence from us or have your personal information shared with other entities for their marketing purposes.

Information Collected on this Website

**User-Provided Information**

We may collect personal information from users, for example, through such user’s activities, transactions and completion of surveys and other online forms on our website.

You may be able to send information about our website, products and services to your friends and family members by clicking on an “E-mail to Friend” or similar button on our website or in one of our e-mails.

**Web Site Usage Information**

**Cookies:** We may use “cookies” to keep, and sometimes track, information about you, and to create a personalized Web experience. Cookies are small data files that are stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies track where you travel on our website and what you look at and purchase. By using this website, you agree to our use of cookies in this way.

Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on your computer, your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies. However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the website or certain areas or features of the website.

**Clear GIFs:** We may use “clear GIFs” (a/k/a “Web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies, on the website and/or in our communications (e.g., in our HTML-based e-mails) which enable us to know whether you have visited a Web page or received or opened a message. This allows us to know the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

**IP Address and Clickstream Data:** Our server may automatically collect data about your server’s Internet address when you visit us. This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that’s automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you’re on the Internet. In addition to logging your IP Address and sometimes your domain name, our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another website or a search engine); the pages you visit on this website; how long you stay, the website you visit after this website; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about your computer and its settings; any search terms you have entered on this website  or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data.

**Matching Web Site Usage Information and Personal Information:** Website usage Information may be tracked in both aggregate form and at an individual user level. We may also match information collected from you through different means or at different times, including both personal information and website usage information, and use such information along with information obtained from other sources, including third parties. We may also analyze user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our website and e-mails, both on an individual basis and in the aggregate. Any or all of these activities with regard to website usage may be performed on our behalf by our services providers.

**How Personal Information is Used**

We may use your personal information, for example, to respond to your requests and to provide you with our product and service offerings (for example, to process your orders and respond to your requests and inquiries). We may also use your personal information to maintain our internal record keeping. In addition, we may send you e-mail notices and offers and otherwise correspond with you, about products, services, companies and events, sponsored by us and others, that we think might interest you. You may opt-out of receiving such notices and offers from us, at any time, by following the instructions in the Right to Opt In and Opt Out section above

**Short Message Service**

We may make available a service through which you can receive messages on your cell phone or other wireless device via short message service (“SMS Service”). If you subscribe to one of our SMS Services, you thereby agree to receive SMS Service messages from us at the address you provide for such purposes (unless and until you have elected not to receive such messages by following the instructions in the **Right to Opt In and Opt Out** section above).

You understand that your wireless carrier’s standard rates apply to these messages, and that you may change your mind at any time by following the instructions in the **Right to Opt In and Opt Out** section above. You represent that you are the owner or authorized user of the wireless device you use to sign up for the SMS Service, and that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges. To use the SMS Service, you must be 18 years of age or older, or otherwise be authorized to accept the applicable charges on your carrier bill, and reside in the United States. You must first register and provide all required Personal Information, which may include, for example, your name, SMS address, wireless carrier and, if fees are applicable to the SMS Service you subscribe to, billing information (either your credit card information or mobile service carrier information if applicable fees will be billed through your carrier). We may also obtain the date, time and content of your messages in the course of your use of the SMS Service. We will use the information we obtain in connection with our SMS Service in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If fees are charged to your wireless account invoice, we may provide your carrier with your applicable information in connection therewith. Your wireless carrier and other service providers may also collect data about your wireless device usage, and their practices are governed by their own policies.

You acknowledge and agree that the SMS Service is provided via wireless systems, which use radios (and other means) to transmit communications over complex networks. We do not guarantee that your use of the SMS Service will be private or secure, and we are not liable to you for any lack of privacy or security you may experience. You are fully responsible for taking precautions and providing security measures best suited for your situation and intended use of the SMS Service. We may also access the content of your account and/or wireless account with your carrier for the purpose of identifying and resolving technical problems and/or service-related complaints.

**Targeted Advertising**

Security

The Princeton Review will take steps to protect the security and integrity of all sensitive personal information provided to us. However, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.

If you contact us by e-mail or a similar feature on our website, your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information you send by these methods in transit.

If so, you are responsible for protecting your account password, and you are responsible for any access to or use of the website by you or any person or entity using your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by or on behalf of you.

In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail. **You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification.**
