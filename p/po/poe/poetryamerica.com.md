The NAI Opt-out Tool was developed in conjunction with our members for the express purpose of allowing consumers to "opt out" of the behavioral advertising delivered by our member companies. 

Using the Tool below, you can examine your computer to identify those member companies that have placed an advertising cookie file on your computer. 

To opt out of an NAI member's behavioral advertising program, simply check the box that corresponds to the company from which you wish to opt out. Alternatively, you can check the box labeled "Select All" and each member's opt-out box will be checked for you. Next click the "Submit" button. The Tool will automatically replace the specified advertising cookie(s) and verify your opt-out status. 

**Opting out of a network does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising.** It does mean that the network from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your Web preferences and usage patterns. 

If you have any questions, please visit our [FAQ section](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/faqs.asp).
