Poetry for Kids - Privacy Policy 

Our aim is to provide poetry for children of all ages in a fun and enjoyable way. We've tried to make getting around the site as easy as possible. Parents of younger children may want to first explore the site with their children to help orient them.

Poetry for Kids respects the privacy of its visitors. There is no registration required to use our site. We adhere to the [Children's Online Privacy Protection Act](http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/childrens.html).

**Information We Collect**

Your child will be asked to provide a name and email address only if they wish to become a member of the Funny Poetry Fan Club. **A valid email address is required** for participation in the funny poetry fan club, but **a real name is _not_ required**. Children 13 years of age or younger must obtain parental permission before submitting any information. Your child will never be asked for his or her gender, age, address, phone number, or any other identifying information.

Members of the Funny Poetry Fan Club may cancel their membership at any time. Doing so removes all record of the member from our database.

Children will not be required to submit any other personal information when they are in the Poetry for Kids web site, although they may, from time to time, submit information voluntarily including their ratings and comments on the poems provided here and messages in the discussion forums. Children may also voluntarily send comments via email using the feedback form provided on the website. All information submitted by children will be used by Poetry for Kids only for the development and improvement of the site and will never be sold or shared with other companies or web sites.

In addition:

  * We automatically collect and store: the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet; the Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our sites; and the Internet address of the site from which you linked directly to our sites. We use this information only as anonymous aggregate data to determine the number of visitors to different sections of our sites and to help us make our sites more useful. We do not use it to track or record information about individuals. Generally, we delete this information after one year.
  * We do not use "cookies" or tracking mechanisms that collect personally identifying information on our sites.

How We Use and Disclose Information 

We do not disclose any information about our members or visitors with any other other organizations or individuals.

**Links to other sites**

We do link to other sites on the Internet, which may or may not require registration. Parents should advise children to get their parents' permission before submitting any information over the Web. See the Federal Trade Commission's [Kidz Privacy](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html) page for more information on how to protect your children's privacy online.

We have done our best to ensure that all the sites linked to from our web site are kid-friendly, but content on the Internet changes minute by minute, so we can't guarantee the content of every site.

**Advertising**

Currently the Poetry for Kids website advertises for sale books of poetry by author Kenn Nesbitt, and anthologies containing Kenn Nesbitt's poems. All books listed in the Books section of the Poetry for Kids web site are for information purposes only and are not paid advertisements. In addition, we offer advertisements through the [Google AdSense](http://www.google.com/adsense) program and other select vendors that may be of interest to the viewers of our website.

It is our intention to adhere to the [Self-Regulatory Guidelines for Advertising](http://www.caru.org/guidelines/index.asp) of the [Children's Advertising Review Unit](http://www.caru.org/) of the [Better Business Bureau](http://www.bbb.org/).

As mentioned above, we have done our best to ensure that all the sites linked to from our web site are kid-friendly, but content on the Internet changes minute by minute, so we can't guarantee the content of every site. If you feel that any ad links to an inappropriate website, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20081218073504id_/http%3A//www.poetry4kids.com/modules.php?name=Feedback) with the name of the site so we may filter it to prevent it from appearing on poetry4kids.com.
