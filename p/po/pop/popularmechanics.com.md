**Purpose of this Privacy Policy  
** This privacy policy describes how Hearst Communications, Inc, the company that publishes Popular Mechanics magazine ("Hearst") treats the personally identifiable information that is collected about you by Hearst when you visit the web sites to which this policy is linked and the information collected on Hearst's behalf to the extent Hearst uses third- party service providers to collect information about site users.

**What is Personally Identifiable Information**  
"Personally identifiable information" is information that we can use to identify you as an individual. Personally identifiable information includes your name, address, telephone number and any other information that is connected with you personally.

**Information This Privacy Policy Does Not Apply To**  
This privacy policy does not apply to information collected about you by anyone except Hearst (and its third party service providers acting on its behalf) and only applies to the Popularmechanics.com web site (that is, the home page bearing the URL "Popularmechanics.com" and the subpages of the site bearing the high level domain "Popularmechanics.com"). Any information you provide when you visit web sites other than those covered by this policy (including the web site to which you will be linked if you subscribe online to Popular Mechanics magazine and including other web sites affiliated with Hearst and its magazines) or when you purchase any products or services that may be offered or advertised on our web site by companies other than Hearst is subject to the privacy policies of the third party organizations who run and/or own these web sites. This Policy does not apply to information you may provide to us offline.

**Collection of Personally Identifiable Information**  
Hearst generally collects personally identifiable information with your specific knowledge and consent. For instance, when you complete a survey, subscribe to our newsletter, or send us e-mail, you will be asked to provide information such as your e-mail address, name, phone number, and sometimes shipping address. Optional information such as your age or gender may also be requested. This information may be collected by third party service providers with whom Hearst contracts to host the web site or to fulfill requests for services; in that event, Hearst asks such service providers to make the personal information available only to Hearst for Hearst to use in accordance with the terms of this policy and not to use the information for any other purpose.

Hearst uses this information to provide you with the service you have requested. If you elect to receive our newsletter, we may use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice and your mailing address to send you your magazine. Similarly, if you enter online sweepstakes, we will use this information to notify you if you are a winner.

In addition, Hearst may use information you provide us through emails and in response to polls for editorial purposes. Please be advised that any such submissions become the property of Hearst, and may be used by Hearst for any lawful purpose.

Hearst may share or disclose personally identifiable information about you to other companies or individuals, including our advertisers, when:

  * we have your consent to share the information (you can refuse consent by declining to select the appropriate box that authorizes sharing or by notifying Hearst at [pmwebmaster@hearst.com](mailto:pmwebmaster@hearst.com).); 
  * we utilize third party service providers to provide products, services or functions on our behalf (such as sending emails or processing credit cards or fulfilling subscriptions), and ask these service providers to agree to maintain the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information and not to use your personally identifiable information for any reason except to carry out the purpose(s) for which we hired them; 
  * the entity to whom the information is disclosed is one under control of, or under common control with Hearst (for these purposes, a company controlling 20% or more of the voting stock of another entity shall be deemed to control such entity); 
  * the entity to whom the information is disclosed is hosting web sites associated with our magazines or magazines we publish in conjunction with a third party, other than those web sites covered by this policy; 
  * we need to protect our legal rights (for example, if we are trying to collect money you owe us); 
  * we must comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal or regulatory process; or 
  * in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange, or other disposition (whether of assets, stock, or otherwise) of all or a portion of the business conducted by the web sites to which this policy applies.
