# Privacy Policy

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact our **Privacy Coordinator** by e-mail, phone or postal mail:

**Personal Information**   
ApexMail.Net has access to information about members from the registration form and from upgrades to the Professional service.

From the site's registration form, we obtain the user's name and e-mail address. This information is used for system administration and for contacting the user when necessary. Contact is made for reasons relating to customer support, account upgrades, new feature announcements, virus alerts, and maintenance disruptions to the mail service.

From time to time, selected and consenting users may be asked to complete online surveys, either relating to customer service or on behalf of advertisers. Demographic information collected by surveys may be shared with advertisers, but on an aggregate basis only. 

**Financial Information**   
Financial information that is collected for Professional upgrades is used to bill the user for products and services only. We share financial information with third party intermediaries (credit card companies and banks) when processing credit card payments; these intermediaries do not store, retain or use the information we give them. During upgrades, members have the choice of sending their credit card information through a secure server or a non-secure server. Information submitted through the secure server is encrypted for protection.

**Updating Personal Information**   
Members can correct or update their personal information at any time by contacting us via e-mail or by telephone.

Member accounts are closed after ninety days of account inactivity, at which point personal information is erased from the system. 

**IP Addresses**   
We collect IP addresses for system administration and to share aggregate information with our advertisers. The originator's account name and IP address are inserted onto the header of a message when it is transmitted in or out of the system; this information is used to track the source of a message in cases of system abuse. 

**Children**   
Users must be 13 years of age or older to open an ApexMail account. If ApexMail learns that a user under 13 is publicly posting or sharing personally identifiable information, it will protect the child by closing the account in question and by deleting any personal information we may have inadvertently collected from the child.

**Partner Sites**   
Members who sign up for e-mail through one of our co-branded partner sites have the same privacy protection as ApexMail members. The personal and Professional upgrade information gathered from these members is collected by ApexMail, and not by our co-branded partners. We do not share any personally identifiable information with our partners.

**Banner Advertising**   
This site, ApexMail, uses the services of Engage for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions, and other marketing messages. To do this, Engage collects anonymous data about your visit to this and other web sites, typically by using cookies. To learn more about Engage, including your ability to opt out of the Engage system, follow this URL: <http://www.engage.com/privacy>.

**Cookies**   
Cookies are currently used by ApexMail only for our own statistical purposes, to aid us in the areas of site design, feature upgrades, service troubleshooting etc.; however, the functionality of the mail service is not affected in any way if the user's browser is configured to reject cookies. Cookies may also be used by third parties that provide value-added services to subscribers of the upgrade service; in this case, cookies are used to store user name and password for smooth integration between the mail service and the value-added service.

Advertisements appearing on our site may contain cookies. Cookies received with banner advertisements are collected by our advertising company (see above); we do not have access to this information, nor are we responsible for it.

**Security**   
We have security procedures in place to protect the member information we collect from loss, misuse or alteration. All member information is password-protected and limited to authorized personnel only. Our personnel are made aware of the privacy practices of the site through our in-house privacy policy, which is circulated to all employees twice yearly. Web security is reviewed once a month.

When our upgrade order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked or open when you are just 'surfing'.

**Links to Other Sites**   
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are going to another Web site. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of these linked sites, as their privacy policy may differ from ours.

**Legal Issues**   
ApexMail.Net will not disclose any personally identifiable information, such as e-mail address, name, phone number or postal address, without prior consent of the user; however, such information will be divulged if the law requires it, or to protect the rights or property of ApexMail.Net. The company will only disclose member information on an aggregate basis and under confidentiality agreements with partners, advertisers and third parties. 

**Changes to Privacy Practices**   
Members will be notified by e-mail in the event that ApexMail.Net changes its privacy practices. Any questions about the privacy policy, the practices of this site, or dealings with this site may be directed to our **privacy coordinator**.
