It is believed that the use of low-resolution images of works of art and other visual identifiers such as drawing and/or photographs qualifies as fair use under United States copyright law for both critical commentary and educational use, although we use several paid-for sources for photography we use for our websites. If you use any of our pictures for your website, we ask that you give credit to the photographer and a link to the source website.

If you are the owner(s) of any of these works, we will gladly link to your website or include specific copyright information, or work with you to insure proper credit for the information and creative content included on each page of the website.

Everything else © copyright 1999-2016 Pop Culture Madness, unless stated otherwise.

_Privacy Statement: We will not sell, give or share any personal information, including e-mail addresses, of any of our visitors to anyone outside of Pop Culture Madness. com or our affiliated network sites. We do not accept any stealth or spyware advertisers or third party sponsors of such programs. Pop Culture Madness. com and affiliated sites do not send spam, offer get-rich-quick schemes, offer or suggest “enhancement” devices or medications via e-mail._

_For purposes of Review, we often (usually) get samples, Reviews, get press access and other ‘inside information.’_

Take that into account when you read a positive (or negative) Review on PCM or anywhere on the internet. We do not place stories up for payment unless it is a stated sponsor or a link that we believe will be helpful and relevant to our visitors.

PCM does use third-party advertising companies, such as google, to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, _[click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). _

This Privacy Policy covers all of the sites on the Pop Culture Madness network.

The Privacy Policy governs your access to and use of the PCM, websites, and applications offered by Pop Culture Madness (the “PCM”). Please  
read this statement carefully before using or proceeding to access PCM. Your use of PCM indicates that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and indicates your agreement to abide by the Terms of Use in effect and to be subject to this policy.

PCM or third parties may collect information from our users at several different websites on PCM.

**Mailing Lists & Service Emails**

PCM may launch a mailing list, in order to provide subscribers with relevant information – breaking news, or weekly or daily round-ups, for example. In order to sign up to receive regular emails from a site’s mailing list, users must submit information including a valid email address and demographic information such as location and interests. Entering any PCM or affiliated contest may put you on our mailing list.

This information may be used in aggregate form in order to assess general user interest in various internal and third party products  
and PCM. Your personal and contact information will not be passed to any other organization. Users who choose to sign up for a mailing list may receive regular emails from the site.

PCM may from time to time track user email usage in a continued effort to improve our PCM. Most of the time, these communications will consist of content from the site in question, but we may occasionally send out an email from a third party sponsor. Since editorial independence is critical to us, you can be sure that we will always mark sponsored content as such, including in emails. If you do not wish to receive emails from third party advertisers, please do not sign up for the mailing list.

**Comment Service and Account Information**

In order to further enhance the user experience, PCM allows users to comment on some or all of PCM sites, enabling users to discuss and contribute to topics posted to those sites. In order to keep some type of accountability, we use Facebook comments. Users have the option of signing up for this service, and to do so must either submit some valid information or set up an anonymous account. PCM uses this information to screen out users who leave comments prohibited by our Terms of Use, to make notifications to users when necessary, to pick out topics of interest to commenters, and in certain circumstances to create a PCM “page” for each such user where such user’s contributions are collected. You may link your account to certain Third Party PCM and to do so, may be required to provide your login information for those PCM. If you login via a Third Party Service, we will receive an identifying token from that service, which will allow us to access some information from your account on that service, so that we can, for example, send you a message through that service. PCM does not receive or store passwords from your Third Party Service and will not pass information provided when you register via a Third Party Service to any other organization except in aggregate form.

**Cookies**

PCM or third parties may use cookies, web beacons, HTML5 local storage, java script, and other similar technologies to help us understand how you use the PCM and help us provide the PCM and advertising to you. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once the user closes the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following the user’s internet browser help file directions. We store a cookie on each user’s machine that contains user specific information. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use PCM that require you to “sign in,” and you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings. However, not all PCM require that you accept cookies.

**Links**

PCM contains links to other sites. Some of these links may be affiliate marketing links encoded by third parties. Such third parties do not collect any personally identifiable information unless you visit the referenced site. Please be aware that PCM is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by PCM.

**Embedded Content**

You should also be aware that some content delivered through PCM originates with another content provider. Such other content providers may place “cookies” on your computer, or otherwise gather information about you, including by asking you to provide information through the content player itself. Again, it is up to you to review the terms of use and privacy policy of the originators of such content.

Log Files – Like most standard Website servers we use log files to log certain information about how you use PCM. We do not, however, collect IP addresses or log IP address information.

In each case, we will collect and record the information you have provided. Other than names and email addresses provided at your discretion, we don’t generally collect any “Personally Identifying Information” about our users (such as social security number, telephone number, street address, drivers license number, etc.). However, we may offer you the opportunity to submit other information about yourself (such as birthday, gender, age, occupation, hobbies, interests, zip code, etc.), which would then also be covered by this Privacy Policy.

**Advertising**

The ads appearing on this website are delivered to you by our web advertising vendors, which may include Google’s DoubleClick, Viacom, Advertising.com, Amazon, additional third parties and PCM’s own proprietary advertising delivery software. In order to serve ads to you, we may use information collected during your current search or visit to our websites and information that we specifically acquire from third parties. Data that we collect may be shared with some other third parties and is only used for proprietary ad delivery, ad reporting, and contextual advertising. These third parties do not have the right to use the information beyond the scope necessary to support our advertising and are usually bound by confidentiality requirements unless we disclose to you otherwise.

**Advertising and Cookies**

Some of our third party advertising partners may distribute cookies to users in advertisements that are provided to us. PCM has no access to or control over these cookies once we have received the advertisements. Some of these advertisers and PCM we use to deliver advertising may be engaging in online behavioral advertising as defined by the Digital Advertising Alliance and FTC.

**Affiliate Advertising**

We participate in affiliate marketing and allow affiliate links to be encoded on some of our pages. This means that we may earn a commission when you click on or make purchases via affiliate links and affiliate partners may use cookies to understand your use of the PCM.

PCM does not provide any Personally Identifiable Information to third-party advertising companies. Note, however, that if an advertiser asks PCM to show an advertisement to users with certain characteristics (for example, women ages 18-24) or a segment of that group (for example, women ages 18-24 who have viewed certain categories of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the third-party advertising company may conclude that you have the characteristics of the audience that they are trying to reach.

Opt-out – As part of our commitment to transparency and your privacy, we provide the following links to opt-out of cookies provided by both our first party ad server and many third party advertising partners who may be engaging in online behavioral advertising:

First Party Opt-out – Please visit this link to opt-out of cookies from  
our first party ad serving vendor, Google: <http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/>

Third Party and Online Behavioral Advertising Opt-out – Please visit this link to opt-out of cookies from over 50+ major third party behavioral advertising providers: <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>

**Contests, Sweepstakes, and Promotions**

From time to time you may be able to participate in contests, giveaways, sweepstakes or other similar promotions we or third parties may sponsor. Participation may require sharing your personal information with us or third parties sponsoring the contest, giveaway, sweepstakes or promotion, and you should check the rules to determine how your information will be used and shared with others. PCM may announce specific rules in connection with any such opportunity, but regardless of whether specific rules are announced, all such opportunities will be controlled by PCM’s “Contest Policies” set forth at Contest Guidelines. Any contest entrant must have an address in North America.

Any rules announced at the time of a contest will be in addition to the Contest Policies. In addition, as a condition to receiving any awards or prizes, you may be required to provide additional information, to sign a release, or to authorize the use of certain information about you in marketing materials. If a third party administers the contest, your participation may be subject to additional terms and conditions and that third party’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for such third parties. You should carefully review the Contest Policies and these third parties’ terms and conditions before deciding whether to participate in a contest publicized through the Service.

**Additional Information**

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, PCM may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on PCM or affiliates. If we’re going to turn over information related to you, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with advance notice, unless we are prohibited from doing so by law or court order.

PCM has technical, administrative and physical safeguards in place to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of user information we maintain. Under our security practices and policies, access to personally identifiable information is authorized only for those who have a business need for such access, and sensitive records are to be retained only as long as necessary or business or legal needs and destroyed before disposal. Although we work hard to protect personal information that we collect and store, no program is one hundred percent secure and we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose personal information.

Whenever PCM changes its privacy policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy page, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. The prior version of our Privacy Policy is found here and more on why we’ve made the most recent changes here. You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any changes to this agreement.

If you become aware of a security issue, please email us at office[at] popculturemadness [dot] com. We will work with you to address any problems.

If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact the office[at] popculturemadness [dot] com., or by mail to Pop Culture Madness, 336 East Edgewater Way, Newark DE 19702
