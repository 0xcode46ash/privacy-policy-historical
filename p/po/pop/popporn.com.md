##  1\. Personal information we collect 

We collect personal information that you choose to provide voluntarily when using the TLA website. This information includes your name, email address and a password when you register to create your tlavideo.com account. You are able to browse our site and place an order without registering, but you will need to do so in order to take advantage of special TLA features. We may also ask you for personal information when you contact our customer service department. This is necessary so we can protect against fraud and to process your request more efficiently. 

###  Purchase information 

When you place an order with tlavideo.com, we collect your name, email address, phone number, billing and shipping addresses, credit card number, expiration date and identification code if applicable. This information is important in processing your order and verifying your billing address. It also allows us to ship your order and keep you informed regarding the status of your order. Billing information can be provided over the phone by calling our customer service department at 1.800.333.8521x1. 

If you are a registered customer of tlavideo.com, you can save your shipping address or billing information for one or more credit cards in [My User Account](https://www.tlasecure.com/customer/userlogin.cfm?v=4&sn=1&g=0&go=%2Fcustomer%2Faccount%5Fmain%2Ecfm%3Fv%3D4%26g%3D0%26sn%3D1&domain=popporn.com&fsc=\(*CFID*!2.40306325E8,*sn*!1,*CFTOKEN*!1.5091156E7,*ic*!false\)&adult_pass=y). You may change or delete this information at any time by clicking on [My User Account](https://www.tlasecure.com/customer/userlogin.cfm?v=4&sn=1&g=0&go=%2Fcustomer%2Faccount%5Fmain%2Ecfm%3Fv%3D4%26g%3D0%26sn%3D1&domain=popporn.com&fsc=\(*CFID*!2.40306325E8,*sn*!1,*CFTOKEN*!1.5091156E7,*ic*!false\)&adult_pass=y).

###  Cookies and other computer information

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once. 

Your browser must be set to accept this "cookie" for you to be able to shop on tlavideo.com. You can delete this "cookie" on your computer once you have completed shopping. To delete a cookie on your browser refer to the "Help" menu on your particular browser. 

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you. 

Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by TLA and our marketing and site customization partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers and chat providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. 

We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 or Flash to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as Flash to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. For information on how to manage Flash LSOs please click [here.](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html)

We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personal information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads. 

###  Other times we may collect personal information 

From time to time, TLA may conduct contests and/or giveaways using our Website, email, or other media. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. If you choose to participate, we may require you to supply personal information such as email and/or postal mailing information. We treat this information with the same policies as outlined in this document. 

We will use your email address that you provide to respond to your questions, suggestions, to send participants an email newsletter, and/or requests for assistance in using tlavideo.com. 

We do not currently use a third party service provider to conduct these contests or giveaways (though we reserve the right to do so in future); if we do ever use a third party service, that company will be prohibited from using our users’ personal information for any other purpose. We will not share the personal information you provide through a contest or giveaway with other third parties.

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. 

We never sell or rent your billing or credit card information to any third parties under any circumstance. We will share customer information only with our agents, representatives and trusted service providers and contractors for the limited purposes of fulfilling customer orders such as a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services and a shipping company to fulfill orders; offering certain products and services in connection with our Website; communication to customers; providing customer service via live chat software; enhancing and improving the customer shopping experience; providing a personalized shopping experience and completing credit card transactions. 

We will not share your email address with any third party without your explicit consent. Occasionally we run promotions on our site, which may include the opportunity to opt-in to email lists for specific partner companies. In these cases, sharing your email address will not be required and the promotion will include specific information about how your email address will be shared. 

On occasion, we partner with other major companies whose products or services we feel offer the same high quality and standards as our own. In these instances our postal mailing lists are made available to them. While we carefully pick and choose whom we partner with, we understand perfectly if you prefer to hear from no one but us. To remain exclusively with us and not receive information about any other companies or their services, please call us at 1-800-333-8521, ext. 1 or e-mail [helpdesk@tlavideo.com](mailto:helpdesk@tlavideo.com).

Aside from the purposes described above, we will never share your personal information with any third parties unless we have your express permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is required by law such as to comply with a subpoena, bankruptcy proceedings, or similar legal process. 

In the event TLA goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personal information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information. 

We may share aggregated demographic and statistical information with our partners. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

If you click on this image, a small pop-up window displaying site-security information will appear. The digital certificate guarantees that your personal information and/or sensitive information (such as a credit card number) is being transmitted to the secure and encrypted TLA Web server. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at [helpdesk@tlavideo.com.](mailto:helpdesk@tlavideo.com)
