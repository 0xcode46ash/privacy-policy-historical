## 1\. Who are you and what is this Privacy Policy about?

Mind Candy Ltd is a UK family entertainment company that creates extraordinary brands with online games at their heart.  We know that you care about how your Personal Information is used and shared and we care about that too.

Our Privacy Policy tells you how we look after, use and share the Personal Information that we collect from you. Please read this carefully. Unless we tell you or you agree, we do not share your Personal Information with anyone.

When you use any of our Services, you are agreeing to our Privacy Policy.

## 2\. How do you protect my Personal Information?

We are serious about guarding the security of your Personal Information and use a secure server to store your Personal Information. However, like everyone else, we cannot guarantee complete security. We use industry standard organisational and technical security measures to protect your data against unauthorised disclosure or processing. We have certified that we adhere to a legal framework established by the United States Department of Commerce called ‘Safe Harbor’, relating to the collection, use and retention of personal information from the European Union.   To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, please visit [Safe Harbor](http://export.gov/safeharbor/).

Where you are required to choose a password for your account, you are responsible for keeping that password confidential. This means you should limit access to your computer or device and sign off after you have finished accessing your account. If you think someone has access to your password or unauthorised access to your account, please inform us immediately at [info@mindcandy.com](mailto:info@mindcandy.com).

We are not responsible for the misuse of your account or information where you have not kept your password confidential or not reported a breach of security.

This may include your IP address, device information (e.g., MAC address, device type), pages you have requested and cookie information.  Depending on your privacy settings, we may also receive information from social networks you choose to connect with via our Services, e.g. your profile information from Facebook.

## 5\. To whom will you disclose my Personal Information?
