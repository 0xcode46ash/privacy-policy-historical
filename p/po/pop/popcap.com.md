# The PopCap Privacy Policy

* * *

Last updated: August 2011

PopCap Games, Inc. (“PopCap”) is committed to making our website a fun place to visit. We know that you care how information about you is used and shared.  And if you're worried about your privacy - or the security of our site - it's hard to have a good time! That's why we work hard to protect your rights.

Please read the following privacy policy (“Policy”) to understand how we use any information we may collect from you. The Privacy Policy is current as of the “last updated”  date set forth above.  We reserve the right to change this policy from time to time, so be sure to check back periodically.  

This Policy applies to PopCap.com and all websites owned or controlled by PopCap, including the majority of websites operated by subsidiaries or affiliates owned or controlled by PopCap (the “Sites”).  It does not apply to your use of PopCap’s social networking site applications, for which the privacy policy may be found [here](http://www.popcap.com/privacy/social?ad=off).  It also does not apply to those websites owned or operated by subsidiaries and affiliates of PopCap that display their own privacy policy.  PopCap and its owned or controlled subsidiaries and affiliates to which this Policy applies may be collectively referred to herein as “PopCap”, “we”, or “our”, as the context requires.

By visiting any of the Sites, you agree that your personal information will be handled as described in this Policy, which is incorporated by reference into PopCap’s Terms of Service, available at [www.popcap.com/terms](http://www.popcap.com/terms).    If your personal information will be transferred and subject to a materially different privacy policy, we will notify you and give you an opportunity to opt-in before your information becomes subject to such new privacy policy.  
 

##  1\. What Personal Information About You Does PopCap Gather?

The information PopCap collects from you helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at our Sites. Here are the types of information we gather:

  * **_Purchase Related Information_** **:** We receive and store any information you enter on a Site or that you provide to us when you enter promotions or sweepstakes or use our products or services. Some information, such as a valid email address or credit card billing information, may be necessary to purchase a game, subscribe to a newsletter or one of our services, access particular features, or otherwise transact business with us.  You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. As detailed more fully below, we use the information that you provide  to verify your right to access products and services, and for billing, responding to your requests, responding to customer service inquiries, customizing your experience at our Sites, improving our online stores, improving our products and services, and communicating with you.  We may also occasionally ask you to provide information voluntarily, such as your opinions about games or your demographics none of which is required to access our products and services.  
 


  * **_Information About Other People:_** On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you order a gift certificate online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient's name and email address. We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to send the gift certificate, and this information may be shared with companies or agents who perform this function on our behalf. We do not otherwise share this information with outside parties.  
 


  * **_Technical Information We Collect Automatically_** **:** We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us.  For example, we may automatically send software and other information to your computer and receive non-personally identifiable information from your computer, including without limitation, information about your operating system, hardware and software versions, which we will use to: 1) automatically update (with new features, bug fixes, etc.) our products and services that you have downloaded; 2) perform quality and assurance testing for our products and services; and 3) deliver information about other products and services we offer.  In addition, our servers automatically recognize your computer’s IP address and other technical information about your Web browser and domain name. See the section below entitled “IP Address Information” for more information. Like many websites, we also use  automated tools, such as “cookies,” to obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses our Sites and through your online interactions with our Sites.  Please see the section  entitled “Automated Tools”  for more information.

We may use the information gathered through these methods in anonymous or aggregated form to analyze ways to improve our products and services. In some cases, we may assign a unique anonymous identifier to the PopCap product or service which you have downloaded.  By using the non-personally identifiable information that is associated with such identifier, we can personalize your experience, recommend products and services or make special offers to you specifically based on your preferences and usage of our products and services, without personally identifying you.



  * Game Play Data: When you play a PopCap game while connected to the Internet, we may record game play activity, such as game scores, how often a game is played and the use of game features.    
 


  * Social Networking Site Services.  Some features of the Sites may be able to connect to your social networking sites to obtain additional information about you.  In such cases, PopCap may be able to collect certain information from your social networking profile when your social networking service permits it, and when you consent to allow your social networking site to make that information available to PopCap.  This information may include, but is not limited to, your name, profile picture, gender, user ID, email address, your country, your language, your time zone, the organizations and links on your profile page, the names and profile pictures of your social networking site “friends” and other information you have included in your social networking site profile.    
 


  * **_E-mail Communications_** **:  **To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from our Sites if your computer supports such capabilities. We may also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending undesired  messages to our customers, and to comply with best practices and applicable legal authority. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please visit <http://www.popcap.com/unsubscribe> for information about how to unsubscribe from such emails.




##  2\. IP Address Information

Each time you visit PopCap.com or another Site, our Web server automatically recognizes your IP address, as well as other technical information about your Web browser and domain name.  In addition, our servers may look up the IP address and other information about your computer or handheld device so that PopCap can: 1) display specific or localized content and advertisements that may interest you based on the geographic location of your computer, 2) to enable certain features of PopCap.com or the relevant Site, and 3) to display the appropriate monetary currency.  

We do not combine your IP address with personally identifiable information about you unless you have established a PopCap user account, such as a PopCap Passport Account or an account for the PopCap Forum, or if you contact PopCap for customer support.  If you choose to register for a PopCap user account, your IP address may be combined with the information you provide to PopCap when establishing that user account, including your email address, password, billing information and any language preferences you provide to PopCap.

##  3\. Automated Tools

PopCap uses certain automated tools to identify you as a unique user.  A “cookie” is an example of such a tool. A cookie is a small text file recorded on your computer's hard drive, your mobile phone, your PDA or other device through your web browser.   We use cookies on our Sites to improve the quality of our Sites and services. For example, some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Sites, while other cookies provide features such as storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits.  

Third parties may also use cookies on our Sites so that they can perform certain activities, such as tracking your Shopping Cart activity and recording information about your online activities  to optimize your experience with PopCap..  Third party advertisers also may send cookies to your devices and collect information from cookies (see the Third Party Advertising Companies section below).  
 

##  4\. Member Accounts, Passwords, and Invitations

Your password is unique to your PopCap account and is designed to protect your account from unauthorized use.  PopCap is not responsible for any lost, stolen, or otherwise disclosed passwords.  Additionally, PopCap will not replace or reinstate any game credits or other awards that are generated or redeemed by unauthorized password activity.  You are responsible for keeping your account information and password secret. PopCap representatives will never ask you for your password.

##  5\. How Does PopCap Use Information it Receives?

PopCap uses the information we gather for the following purposes:

•    To provide our products and services to you, to bill you for products and services, to collect and remit applicable taxes to communicate with you concerning your account, and for other customer service, authorization, account history and billing purposes.  This may include credit card authorization and verification, free trial access, location verification for products and services which may have limited geographical access, and the like.  
•    To improve our software and services by providing personalized experiences and recommendations, language and location customization, personalized help and instructions.  
•    To track purchases and usage as necessary for the purpose of making royalty or other payments to third parties.  However, your personally identifiable information will not be transferred to such third parties unless you have been notified in advance and given an opportunity to opt out or cancel.    
•    To offer you upgrades, updates, content, services, games or other products and services.  
•    To ask you to participate in surveys about products and services.  
•    To provide you with news and newsletters, special offers, promotions, and targeted advertising.  
•    To better understand how users access and use our products and services, including our Sites and advertising, on an aggregated and individualized basis, for the purposes of improving our products and services, and responding to customer desires and preferences.  
 

##  6\. When and How Does PopCap Share Information It Receives?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as (1) compatible with the purposes described above, (2) when we have your permission, or (3) as described in this section. 

  * **PopCap Subsidiaries:** We may share your information with subsidiaries and affiliates that we own or control, but only if those entities are either subject to this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy.


  * **Contractors and Agents:** We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance (including data concerning marketing and promotional programs), providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, providing customer service, or for other purposes within the ordinary course of business. These third parties have access to personal information needed to perform their functions on our behalf. We require these companies to agree (1) to provide adequate protections for your personal information that are no less protective than those set out in this Privacy Policy and (2) to use your personal information only for the purposes for which the third party has been engaged by us. We are not liable for the acts or omissions of these third parties, except as provided by applicable law.


  * **Promotional Offers; Third Party Advertising; Third Party Sites:  **We may send offers to PopCap customers on behalf of other businesses and/or include promotions of third party products and services (with links to third party websites). When we do this, we do not give that business your personal information. If you do not want to receive such offers, please go to [ http://www.popcap.com/unsubscribe](http://www.popcap.com/unsubscribe) for information about how to unsubscribe to such offers.   If you respond to such an offer, or if you click on a link that takes you to a third party’s website, you may, at some point, be required to provide personal information to the other business.  If so, you will have an opportunity to review that other entity’s privacy policy and decide for yourself whether or not to do business with them.  Similarly, third parties that advertise on our site may collect information from you when you navigate away from our site by clicking on another site link or third-party logo.

While we strive to do business only with other reputable entities, we cannot be responsible for how a third party collects or handles personal information obtained directly from you.  We believe our Sites and services are designed in such as way as to make clear when you have left a PopCap page or service and are interacting with another entity.  Each such third party entity’s use of your information is governed by its own privacy policy and/or terms of service.  



  * **Jointly Offered Products and Services:  **From time to time we may offer products or services jointly with another entity, or may offer an additional product or service from another entity that in some way enhances or is related to a PopCap product or service.  Examples include jointly developed or licensed games, another entity’s online service that is based upon a PopCap game, or products or services that may enhance your gaming or computing experience.  In such cases, PopCap’s use of your personal information is governed by this Privacy Policy, and the other entity’s use of your personal information is governed by that entity’s own privacy policy and/or terms of service.  
 


  * **Business Transfers:  **As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy online stores, subsidiaries, or other businesses.  In such transactions, your  personal information generally would be one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy policy (unless, of course, you consent otherwise). In the event that PopCap, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, we will provide notice before your personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a materially different privacy policy or will be handled in a materially different way.  
 


  * **Protection of PopCap and Others:  **We reserve the right to disclose your personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, judicial proceedings, court order or other legal process; enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of PopCap, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction purposes.



##  7\. How Secure Is Information About Me?

  * For information about you that PopCap receives or processes, we take commercially reasonable precautions to protect your personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
  * We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.
  * We will not reveal or store more than the last four digits of your credit card number when you place an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.
  * Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security all of the time.
  * It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. We strongly recommend that you implement measures to protect your computer from unauthorized access such as firewall protection and anti-virus software.



##  8\. Can I Access My Personal Information?

We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we collect and store is reliable, accurate, complete and current. You also may have the right (subject to certain exceptions) to be given a copy of certain data that PopCap may hold about you (and for which we may charge a small fee to process) and to have any inaccuracies in the data that PopCap holds about you corrected and/or erased.  You may exercise any such rights by emailing us at privacy@popcap.com. We will need sufficient information from you to establish your identity and to verify your access request, and also to assist us in handling your request.  Requests will be processed as soon as possible and not later than 40 days. 

##  9\. Third-Party Advertising Companies

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our Sites and on certain PopCap games. Our system and the third-party advertising technology use information derived from cookies on your hard drive. In the course of advertisements being served to you, a unique third-party cookie or cookies may be placed on your computer.  
Similarly, third-party advertising companies may provide us with pixel tags (also called “clear gifs” or “beacons”) to help manage and optimize our online advertising. Beacons enable us to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits the site on which the beacon is located, and to learn which banner ads bring users to a given site.  
PopCap does not provide any personal information to third-party advertising companies. Note, however, that if an advertiser asks PopCap to show an advertisement to users with certain characteristics (for example, women ages 18-24) or a segment of that group (for example, women ages 18-24 who have viewed certain categories of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the third-party advertising company may conclude that you have the characteristics of the audience that they are trying to reach.  
 

##  10\. What Choices Do I Have?

As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, but that may prevent you from being able to make a purchase or to take advantage of specific features of our Sites.

If you do not want to receive promotional e-mails or other promotional communications from PopCap.com, go to  [www.popcap.com/unsubscribe](http://www.popcap.com/unsubscribe)  for instructions about how to unsubscribe from such offers from PopCap.com.

In addition, if a third party ad serving network is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative, you may opt out of placement of certain ad-serving cookies used by such third party ad serving networks through this link [www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).  
The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. You, however, will not be able to use such important features as the PopCap store if you do not use cookies.

The Federal Trade Commission provides useful information about online privacy on its own [website](http://business.ftc.gov/privacy-and-security).

##  11\. Children

PopCap does not sell products for purchase by children and does not knowingly collect personal information from children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under age 13, you may use our Sites only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.
