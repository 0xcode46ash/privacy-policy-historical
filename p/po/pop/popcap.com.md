# PopCap Games - Privacy Policy / Terms of Use / Trademarks

## The PopCap Promise

  
No Spam. No Spy-ware. Ever. That's the PopCap Promise.

PopCap Games is committed to making our website a fun place to visit. And if you're worried about your privacy — or the security of our site — it's hard to have a good time! That's why we work hard to protect your rights. 

Please read the following privacy policy to understand how we use any information we may collect from you. We reserve the right to change this policy from time to time, so be sure to check back periodically. (Our [newsletter](https://web.archive.org/subscribe.php) is a great way to stay posted, too.)

## What information about me will you collect and how will you use it?

  
Wherever possible we collect the minimal amount of information from you that is needed. If you **subscribe to our newsletter** or our email list for special offers from us, we simply collect your email address so we know where to send it. 

If you **buy a game** from us, we collect billing information so we can charge you. We also ask that for your email address to let you know about product updates and more. (For example, if one of our new games has a problem that we missed, we fix it right away and will let you know about it!) 

On a more general level, we do collect information that we use in aggregate to get a sense of how many people have visited our site, which pages are most popular, and things of that nature. Take a look at our complete Privacy Policy and Terms of Use (below) to get really specific information about how this works...

## If I give you my email address, what exactly will you do with it?

  
Friends don't send friends Spam. If you're anything like us, your inbox is probably plenty full as it is. Respecting that, we'll only send you email when we have something important to tell you. 

Plus, you'll have to explicitly let us know if you'd like to receive our newsletter, _The Fizz_. You might also want to sign up for special offers and announcements so you can get exclusive discounts and hear about new games. In every email we send, there will be clear instructions about how to unsubscribe, and you're free to do so at any time! 

Other than that, you'll probably get confirmation emails from time to time, like when you buy a game or first sign up for the newsletter. 

## Do you ever sell or give my email address to third parties?

  
No way! We make our money selling games, not email addresses. Any information we collect is for our own use as described above and any exceptions will be clearly identified as such in advance. If we ever use a third party to say, help us send out our newsletter, they're held to strict privacy standards and are working on our behalf. 

However, our games are widely available through several partners we have. Be sure you understand their privacy policies before sharing any personal information with them. 

## Is it safe to download your games?

  
Absolutely! And it's free and easy! 

When you download our free trial games or buy a deluxe download, you'll be asked to "Save" or "Run" the game. It only takes a minute, and we'll walk you through each step. Then you can start playing right away...without being connected to the Internet!

## What about spyware?

  
Spyware is sneaky and deceptive, and we will never install any spyware software on your computer. We sell games, pure and simple...and we're not going to snoop into your privacy. The only information we know about you is information you offer us yourself and generalized, aggregate information about how all our visitors use our website and games. 

## Do you ever store "cookies"?

  
Yes we do, to give you the best web experience possible. Cookies are convenient ways for the website to remember you, which means we can personalize your experience on our website. For example, cookies help us keep track of what you've added to your shopping cart when you're ready to buy our games. They're really quite handy, and are a time-saver for you!

## What should I do if I think you're violating this policy?

  
Tell us about it! If you ever feel that we are not following this policy, please [send us an email](mailto:%66ee%64b%61c%6b@pop%63a%70.%63%6f%6d) and explain how or why you feel we are violating it. Here's our mailing address, too, if you'd rather send snail mail:  


PopCap Games  
2401 4th Ave, Suite 810  
Seattle, WA 98121  

That about does it. Give a shout if you have any questions or concerns. We'd love to hear from you! 

## And now, a word from our lawyers:

  


PRIVACY NOTICE   
Last updated: May 18, 2006

PopCap Games knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. **By visiting PopCap.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice**. 

**Terms of Use**

Please review our Terms of Use at <http://www.popcap.com/terms.php#terms>, which also governs your visit to PopCap.com. 

**BBB OnLine Privacy Program**

Your privacy is important to us. By participating in the Council of Better Business Bureau's BBBOnLine Privacy Program we have made a commitment to meet the program's strict requirements regarding how we treat your information and have it verified by BBBOnLine. Further information about this program is available at [http://www.bbbonline.org](http://www.bbbonline.org/)

All BBBOnLine Privacy Program participants are required to work with the program's dispute resolution process. The Privacy Program will only accept complaints regarding the misuse of personally identifiable information by a website operator. For more information about the Privacy Program dispute resolution process visit <http://www.bbbonline.org/privacy/dr.asp>

**What Personal Information About Customers Does PopCap.com Gather?**

The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience at PopCap.com. Here are the types of information we gather. 

  * **Information You Give Us:** We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you. 

On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you order a gift certificate online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient's name and email address. We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to send the gift certificate. We do not share this information with outside parties. 

  * **Automatic Information:** We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses PopCap.com. A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at PopCap.com if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist.
  * **E-mail Communications:** To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from PopCap.com if your computer supports such capabilities. We may also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please visit <http://www.popcap.com/unsubscribe.php> or <http://www.popcap.com/helpform_contactus.php>.
  * **Information from Other Sources:** We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.



**What About Cookies?**

  * Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits. 
  * The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of PopCap.com's coolest features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on. 



Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. 

**Member Accounts, Passwords, and Invitations**

You are responsible for keeping the confidentiality of your Member ID and password. PopCap representatives will never ask you for your password. 

**Does PopCap.com Share the Information It Receives?**

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries PopCap.com, Inc. controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice. 

  * **Agents:** We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 
  * **Promotional Offers:** Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of PopCap.com customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please contact PopCap Customer Support at <http://www.popcap.com/helpform_contactus.php>. 
  * **Business Transfers:** As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that PopCap Games, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 
  * **Protection of PopCap.com and Others:** We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of PopCap.com, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.
  * **With Your Consent:** Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. 



**How Secure Is Information About Me?**

  * We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. 
  * We will reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. 
  * Any information we collect will be securely stored and processed in a database that resides in either the United States or Ireland. 
  * It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. 



**Which Information Can I Access?**

PopCap.com will give you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with PopCap.com for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information as our Web site evolves. 

**What Choices Do I Have?**

  * As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of specific PopCap.com features.
  * If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please visit <http://www.popcap.com/unsubscribe.php>. You may also send mail to: 

PopCap Games  
Attention: Opt-Out  
2401 4th Avenue, Suite 810  
Seattle, WA 98121

  * (If you do not want to receive Conditions of Use and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of PopCap.com, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.)
  * The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, you will not be able to use such important features as the PopCap.com store if you do not use cookies. 
  * The Federal Trade Commission provides useful information about online privacy on its own Web site, [Site Seeing on the Internet](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/online/sitesee.shtm). 



**Children**

PopCap.com does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may use PopCap.com only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. 

**Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions**

If you choose to visit PopCap.com, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the state of Washington. If you have any concern about privacy at PopCap.com, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. 

Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the Conditions of Use will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of the persons affected. 

**Third Party Sites**

Other companies that advertise on our site may collect information about you when you view or click on their site or logos. PopCap.com does not control what information third parties gather once you leave the PopCap.com web site. You are encouraged to check the privacy policies of these sites. 

**Third Party Advertising**

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. 

**Third Party Cookies**

In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser. 

**Does Popcap.com Participate in the Safe Harbor Program?**

PopCap.com is a participant in the Safe Harbor program developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Union. We have certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles agreed upon by the U.S. and the E.U. For more information about the Safe Harbor and to view our certification, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's [Safe Harbor Web site](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/index.html).
