# Your Privacy Rights

Nice to meet you. We’re Poppin. For those who care about these kinds of things, our full corporate name is Poppin Inc., and we are a Delaware corporation.

Thank you for visiting us.  Poppin.com understands that you are mindful of how information about you is used and shared.  We respect your privacy and we appreciate your trust that we will use your information with care. We’ve put together this Policy to let you know what types of information we collect from you both on and off the Site and what we do with it.  By the way, when we use the word “Site,” it’s really shorthand for both the Poppin.com web site and any other applications (like iPad and iPhone applications, Facebook pages, etc.) that we may use to put all of our great products at your fingertips.

As much as we’d like to meet each of you personally, we know that you’re busy, and that it’s probably not possible. Since there is no way for us to meet personally and sign a contract, this Privacy Policy (along with our Terms of Use) act as the contract between us, and when you use the Site, you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use (which should be considered part of this document). So, you should definitely read this thoroughly, and if there is something in these Terms that you don’t agree with, you should not use the Site (our lawyers thought that the last part was so important that they insisted we put it in bold). In addition, you can only use the Site if you are over 18 years old. If you are under 18, you may use Poppin.com only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.

While we really like the way things are working right now, it is inevitable that we will change some things over time, as we learn more about you and how we can best serve you. Given that, we must reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we modify it, we will post the new version right here, so it is important that you check back on a regular basis to see whether we’ve made any changes, as you will be agreeing the new Privacy Policy by using the Site after the new version has been posted. For ease of reference, this Privacy Policy was last modified on September 4, 2012.

What information does Poppin collect?

**

We are fanatically driven to make your experience with us easier and better for you. So, wherever we can, we collect and store information that may make it easier for us to improve the shopping experience, display the product or content in which you are likely to be most interested, and make it easier for you to reorder without having to enter information you have already provided. Obviously, in trying to identify ways we can help you shop, we may collect some information we end up not using. However, we try to use common sense to only collect what we think could make a difference in your experience and try to limit it to only what we would be willing to share ourselves if we were in your shoes. We believe that you should know the kinds of information we are collecting. Specifically, we collect the following types of personally identifiable information from you:

**

Information You Provide

**

We collect information that you voluntarily provide when you are using or registering for the Site or communicate with us via phone, email and chat, such as your name, email address, friends’ email addresses, postal address, phone number and credit card, information about the products you purchase or tell us you are interested in and your third-party account credentials (for example your log-in credentials for Facebook). That was a long sentence.  If you access the Site through Facebook Connect or other services like it, you understand that some content and/or information in your third party account may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Policy.

**

Content You Provide

**

From time to time you may send us mail or email that gush about our products or service, videos that show how far your packing list can travel in the shape of an airplane or other content.  We will collect and store this information and reserve the right to use it for promotional purposes.

**

Information Collected by cookies

**

When you visit the Site, we may send one or more “cookies” to your computer. A "cookie" is a small line of text that is stored with your Web browser, which allows us to recognize you when you return to the Site. Your browser has options to accept, reject or provide you with notice when a cookie is sent. Using cookies helps us serve you better. It allows us to do things like save items in your shopping cart, save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the Site, and deliver product recommendations and other content that are customized to fit your interest. However, if you would prefer that we not use cookies on your computer, feel free to set your browser to reject them.

We may also use third-party advertising companies to help tailor site content to users or to serve ads on our behalf.  These companies may employ cookies and web beacons to measure advertising effectiveness (such as which web pages are visited or what products are purchased and in what amount).

**

Information Recorded by our Servers

**

Our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit the Site, such as the pages you visit on our site, your Internet IP address, your browser type, the place on the Internet that you came from immediately before going to the Site, the place on the Internet that you go to immediately after leaving the Site, the amount of time you spent on particular pages and the date and time of your visit.

**

Information Collected by “Clear GIFs”

**

We use "clear GIFs" (a.k.a. Web Beacons) to track online usage patterns anonymously. In addition, we also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails we may send to you in order to track which emails are opened.

**

Product Reviews

**

You may choose to submit a product review. If you post a review, we may ask for personal information such as an email address.  Any personally identifiable information that you submit as part of the review can be read or used by other visitors to Poppin.com. We are not responsible for any personally identifiable information that you choose to submit as part of your review. We believe you can post a helpful review without disclosing personal information.

**

Independent reviews by third parties

**

You may be asked to rate your experiences with Poppin after you place an order with us.  This choice is optional and it will not affect your order or service from us, whether or not you choose to provide feedback. Your feedback will be collected by an independent company and the information that you share is governed by their privacy policy.

**

Information from Other Sources

**

We may receive information from other sources to help us serve you better.  Examples include, but are not limited to, delivery and address information from our carriers which we use to correct our records.

**

How does Poppin use personally identifiable information?

**

We use the information you provide to process and fulfill your order, including to send you emails to confirm your order status and shipment. We also may use information we learn about you to customize our Site for you and to deliver product offers and other information that we think you would be interested in.

Payment information will be used only to process payment transactions.

**

Will Poppin share personally identifiable information with others?

**

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others.  We will not share your personally identifiable information with anyone for their commercial or marketing use except as part of a specific program or feature for which you have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.

Agents: We will share information with third party service providers where they require information to perform their functions.  Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending emails, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance or processing credit card payments.

Business Transfers:  In the event that Poppin.com is acquired, personally identifiable information will be transferred to the acquiring company subject to this Policy.

Protection of Poppin and others:  We may share information when we believe its release is appropriate and necessary to comply with the law, enforce or apply our conditions of use, or protect the rights, property or safety of Poppin, our employees and users.  We may exchange information with other companies or organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

**

How does Poppin keep my information secure?

**

We have implemented a number of security measures to protect your personally identifiable information and we have extra layers of security around your payment information.  We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.  In addition, your account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. It is important that you keep your password to yourself and log off once you have finished using a shared computer so that others can’t access your account.

While we use industry-standard precautions to safeguard your personal information, no security system can ever be guaranteed to be completely secured. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems.  However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.

If Poppin learns of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By providing personally identifiable information to us or using this Site, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues.
