# POPSTAR! » Privacy Policy

**Keeping Your Information Secure:**

Nothing is more important to PopstarOnline.com than protecting the private information of visitors to our Web site, www.PopstarOnline.com (the “Web Site”). Below you will find information about our commitment to ensuring the privacy of you and/or your children’s personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and credit card information. We have adopted this Web Site privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to explain what information may be collected on the Web Site and how such information may be used and/or shared with others. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected through the Web Site and not through any other sources. Please review this Privacy Policy each time you visit the Web Site to ensure that you have read and agree with the current policy, as it may be amended without notice.h

**Gathering and Use of Information:**

PopstarOnline.com will only collect personally identifiable information which is provided to us, by you, on a voluntary basis such as your name, date of birth, email address, city/state/zip and gender when you register with the Web Site. Visitors to the Web Site may also voluntarily supply certain personally identifiable information in connection with e-commerce transactions, including address, telephone number, and credit card information. This information will not be re-used, sold or shared in any manner by PopstarOnline.com. PopstarOnline.com will never willfully disclose any personally identifiable information about our online audience to any third party without first receiving the user’s permission, except to the extent that PopstarOnline.com is compelled to provide such information by law. In addition, personally identifiable information is voluntarily provided in connection with community postings (i.e., blog comments). Please remember that any community postings become public information. Use caution when posting. Users under the age of 18 should be especially careful not to provide any personally identifying information while using the blog.

Our web server also recognizes and records certain non-personal information about our visitors to the Web Site. This information includes the type of browser used (e.g., Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system (e.g., Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows NT, Windows XP, Linux, Macintosh), the IP address of the visitor’s Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, CompuServe, Earthlink), the number of users that visit the Web Site and the duration of such visits. Non-personal information is used only for internal review purposes such as tracking the total number of visitors to the Web Site on an aggregate, non-personally identifiable, basis to help analyze Web Site traffic. At no point, however, do we utilize any personally identifiable information in this process.

Cookies are pieces of information a website sends to your computer while you are viewing the website. These pieces of information allow a website to remember important information that will make your visit to the website more useful. Web Sites use “cookies” stored in your web browser software on your computer. This information is temporary in nature (called session cookies) and is deleted as soon as you close your web browser. We may use “permanent” cookies which are stored on your computer for your user name to manage your account, Web Site preferences and recording of your activity. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser “Help” menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won’t have access to some of the Web Site features that make your web experience more efficient — like the features mentioned above — and some of our services will not function properly.  
Children’s Guidelines:

PopstarOnline.com understands the concerns of parents regarding privacy, especially when it comes to protecting information collected from children, and we strongly encourage parents to supervise and participate in their children’s online activities and consider using parental control tools available through online services and software. These tools help parents maintain an internet environment appropriate for children.

The Web Site is operated in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). We do not request children under the age of thirteen (13) to provide more personally identifiable information than is reasonably necessary. We require children under the age of thirteen (13) to provide us with the contact information for their parent or legal guardian. We will use this parent/legal guardian contact information to (i) notify such parents or legal guardians of their children’s request to register on our website and of our privacy practices, and (ii) seek consent to their child’s registration by completing the process for the child. Without his/her parent’s or legal guardian’s permission, a child under the age of thirteen (13) is unable to register.

PopstarOnline.com does not currently give or sell any personally identifiable information collected from children under the age of thirteen (13) on the website to anyone, unless required to do so for legal reasons, such as a court order or regulatory agency rule. Any personally identifiable information collected for prospective entrants under the age of thirteen (13) will be used only by PopstarOnline.com only as described herein and is secured against unauthorized access.

A parent or legal guardian can request that we remove, change or refuse further submission of information relating to a child under the age of thirteen (13) by sending an e-mail to popstar@popstaronline.com or by contacting us at the address referenced above. Any such request must contain the child’s name and e-mail address so we can locate such child’s information.
