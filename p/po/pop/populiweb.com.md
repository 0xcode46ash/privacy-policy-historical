# Populi - Privacy Notice

Populi has a comprehensive security and Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) that extends to both www.populiweb.com (the “Site”) and a given institution’s unique instance of Populi (the “Service”). We take privacy very seriously and so We desire to explain how We handle the information We receive from You via the Site and the Service. 

“You” may refer to: a client Institution, individual users of the Service, and/or individual visitors to the Site. 

##### Information You Provide on the Site

The only information You provide on the Site is via A) Our “Sign Up” page, where You inform us if You wish to schedule a demo or receive Our newsletter and B) Our Data Migration Survey. We store this information securely and use it solely for the purposes of handling Your request for information from us. 

We collect anonymous information on what Site pages You access or visit. This information is used to improve the Site’s content and usefulness. We do not share, sell, or otherwise distribute this information to other organizations for any reason, except under the following circumstances: 

  * To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law. 
  * We transfer information about You if Populi, Inc or Populi is acquired by or merged with another company. Should this happen, We will notify You before Your information is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy. 
  * Further, We may also transmit or share Your personal information with Our third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other technology and services required to operate and maintain the Service. 



#####  Payment Information 

Populi accepts payment via Automated Clearing House (“ACH”). Invoicing and payment processing are managed via third-party intermediaries. These intermediaries are not permitted to store, retain, or use Your billing information except for the sole purpose of invoice or payment processing on behalf of Populi. 

#####  Information Entered, Stored, and Managed in the Service 

Although Populi owns the software, code, databases, and all rights to the Service, the Institution retains all rights to the personal, academic, and other data entered, stored, and maintained using the Service. 

#####  Cookies 

When You visit the Site or use the Service, We use “cookies”. A cookie is a security token that includes a unique identifier that is sent to Your browser from the Site and stored on Your computer. Populi cookies help us verify who you are and record current session information; they are not permanent. You must log in to Your Populi user account after a certain period of time has elapsed without any activity on Your part to protect against others accessing Your account. Cookies are required to use the Service; if You disable Your web browser’s ability to accept cookies, You will not be able to use the Service. 

#####  Information Sharing 

Except as described in this Policy, Populi does not and will not give, sell, rent, or loan any identifiable personal information to any third party. We may disclose such information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process; to establish or exercise Our legal rights and in defense against legal claims; and if, in Our judgment, it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law. 

We may also provide anonymous group statistics about Our customers, sales, traffic patterns, usage statistics, and related Site and/or Service information to reputable third-party vendors. Such statistics will include no personally identifying information. 

#####  Children’s Personal Information 

The Service and Site are not intended to, nor does Populi knowingly collect, any personal information from children under 13 years of age. 

#####  Protection of Information 

Populi actively maintains security measures to protect Your information and data from loss, destruction, misuse, unauthorized access, and disclosure. These measures help ensure the safety, security, and authorized access of Your data. However, internet security is an ever-evolving and largely defensive enterprise, and so We therefore cannot guarantee the complete security of any Internet data transmissions or information storage technology. 

#####  FERPA 

As a service designed to maintain and store student information, Populi is committed to full compliance with the confidentiality requirements of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). 

#####  Changes to Privacy Policy 

This Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time so that it may reflect updates to the Site and Service. However, We are committed to the fundamentals: You have a right to keep Your personal information private and You may reasonably expect us to respect that right and use Your information responsibly. 

You can review the latest version of this Privacy Policy at any time at **[www.populiweb.com/privacy](https://web.archive.org/privacy)**. You acknowledge and agree that Your continued use of the Site or Service binds You to whatever version of the Privacy Policy is in effect at the time of Your use. If You do not accept the terms of this Privacy Policy, Your only remedy is to discontinue use of the Site and Service. 

In the event of acquisition of or merger with Populi, We may assign or transfer this Privacy Policy, Your user account, and any related information and data, to the surviving organization of such a transaction. 

#####  Terms of Service 

This Privacy Policy is meant to be complementary to the **[Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms)**.
