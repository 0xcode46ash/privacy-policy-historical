**Online Privacy Policy**   


Your privacy on the internet is important to us at Polo.com. Our online privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") describes the types of information we gather online and how we use it. Please read this information carefully. If the online information practices of Polo.com change, we will let you know by posting the Privacy Policy adjustments on our Web site. At that time, we will remind you that you always have the opportunity to opt out of any new use of your Personal Information (as more fully set forth below). This Privacy Policy does not cover our offline privacy practices, which are described in our Privacy Statement for Polo Ralph Lauren stores. 

Our policies relating to the transfer of Personal Information from the European Union ("EU") to the United States are contained in our European Safe Harbor Policy. 

**Use of Information by Polo.com**

We gather certain types of customer information in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products, services, promotions and contests. Polo.com as well as Polo Ralph Lauren stores may also use this information to make offers to you, help us develop and improve Polo.com and tailor our site to your interests. 

**Information Collected by Polo.com**

Polo.com collects two types of information about users: "Personal Information" (such as name, email address, mailing address, phone numer, credit card number and the items you purchase) and "Aggregate Information" (such as information about how many users log on to our sites on a daily basis). 

**Personal Information Collected Online by Polo.com**

Personal Information is collected online when users voluntarily register with Polo.com to purchase items, receive electronic newsletters, use community and communication services, answer surveys and enter contests and other promotional opportunities provided on Polo.com, when users make a purchase, and when users utilize the "Email to a Friend" feature. We also maintain a record of your product interests and purchases online. We may receive personal usage and demographic information from our stores and from third parties we work with including DoubleClick [(www.DoubleClick.Com)](http://www.doubleclick.com/). 

**Aggregate Information Collected Online by Polo.com**

Aggregate Information is nonpersonally identifiable/anonymous information about you, such as age, gender, types of products purchased, pages you access most frequently or search terms you enter. Aggregate Information is used in a collective manner, and no single person can be identified by that compiled information. For example, the number of people who shopped at Polo.com during a specific time period is Aggregate Information that does not personally identify a specific user. Tracking Internet Protocol (IP) addresses is one method of collecting Aggregate Information about your activities online and information volunteered by you. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Web. The computers, which deliver the Web pages to you, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from our site, our servers log your IP address. 

**Sharing Information Collected Online with Third Parties, Service Providers, Consultants and Affiliates**

Polo.com does not share, sell or trade with third parties your Personal Information gathered online, such as email addresses, Personal Information collected as part of an online survey or other specific details about you, except with your consent or as described in this Privacy Policy. We do not contribute to or participate in cooperative databases, which give other companies access to such Personal Information. For privacy purposes, all information relating to our customers is stored on a secure server, and all credit card information is stored in an encrypted format. 

We use Acxiom [(www.acxiom.com)](http://www.acxiom.com/) for data processing services relating to the maintenance of our customer database. Acxiom has agreed to maintain our customer information in confidence and to not disclose customer information to any third parties (unless required to do so by law) or use such information for any purpose other than our business. 

Polo.com may share Personal Information gathered online with our service providers and consultants and with Polo Ralph Lauren stores or for any internal business purpose and may also divulge Personal Information if such action is required for Polo.com or any of our service providers or consultants to comply with any valid legal process, such as a subpoena, search warrant, statute or court order, or any valid administrative request from a law enforcement agency, or if Polo.com or any of our service providers or consultants believes that membership has been used to commit unlawful acts or acts that may endanger the health or safety of another user or of the general public. In addition, Polo.com receives personal usage and demographic information from its affiliates and from third parties and uses this information to improve our products and services. 

Polo.com may share Aggregate Information with affiliates, service providers and consultants for any internal business purpose and with third parties for their advertising and promotional purposes. 

**Use of Cookies**

**Notice to P3P Users**

The Platform for Privacy Preferences Project ("P3P") is a standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium ("W3C") that provides an automated, machine-readable mechanism for understanding the use of your Personal Information by the Web sites you visit. P3P uses a standardized set of multiple choice questions covering the major elements of a Web site's privacy policy to provide a cross-section of how the particular Web site handles the personally identifiable information of its users. P3P-enabled browsers can automatically read this set of preferences made available by P3P-enabled Web sites and compare this information to the user's own set of privacy preferences. For example, Internet Explorer 6.0 requires third parties to set cookies to deliver P3P "compact" cookie policies with their cookies, and other browsers may use this mechanism soon. To enhance your online experience further, the Polo Web site is now P3P enabled. For more information on the W3C and P3P, please visit <http://www.w3.org/P3P/>. Given certain limitations in the parameters chosen by W3C, however, the P3P mechanisms may not describe Polo.com's privacy practices as accurately as this Privacy Policy. Accordingly, where discrepancies exist between this Privacy Policy and the P3P "compact" policies, this Privacy Policy shall control. 

**Security and SSL**

Protecting your order information is a priority for us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower right-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active and the server is secure. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https." Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers. In that case, you won't be able to connect to the server and therefore won't be able to place an order through a secure connection. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, please print our shopping page and place your order by phone at 888-475-7674. 

**E-mail and Electronic Newsletters**

Polo.com and its affiliates may offer electronic newsletters and emails to those who have provided their email address. You will only receive a newsletter or email if you agree during registration or directly from our newsletter sign-up form to receive these items. Unsubscribe instructions are included in each electronic newsletter and email. Please note that when you make a purchase from Polo.com we will send you an email to confirm your order and may also need to contact you via phone, postal mail or email if we have other questions regarding your order. 

**Information Removal**

If you prefer not to receive marketing emails from Polo.com, please let us know by (a) sending us an email at unsubscribe@polo.com, or by (b) clicking on the unsubscribe link within any marketing email you receive from us. If you prefer not to receive marketing mail via the mail carrier, please let us know by sending a request to Jeffrey Steinberg, Chief Privacy Officer, Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation, 650 Madison Avenue, 12th Floor, New York, NY 10022. Please be sure to include in any email or postal mail your full name, email address, postal address and any message. 

Please note that such requests may take up to ten (10) days to become effective. 

If you prefer not to have your aggregate information included in our ongoing site analysis, you can "opt-out" by clicking here: <http://optout.rl.rpts.net/cgi-bin/rpts/optout.pl>

**Children and Privacy**

Polo.com is concerned about the safety of children when they use the internet, and understands that children may not understand all the provisions of our Privacy Policy or make informed decisions about the choices that are made available to adult users of the Polo.com Web site. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time with their children online and to be familiar with the sites their children visit. 

The Polo.com Web site is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we will never request personally identifiable information from anyone whom we know to be under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a customer is under the age of 13 and has registered without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove his or her personally identifiable registration information from our files. 

**Community and Public Areas**

Information posted to message boards, chat areas, club and home pages is available to the general public. Please use caution when posting any such information. Although Polo.com strives to protect our users' privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any Personal Information you provide in these areas. Users under the age of 18 should be particularly careful not to provide any personally identifying information while using chat rooms or message boards. Users of chat areas and message boards must also follow acceptable standards of behavior when posting messages online. Polo.com reserves the right to, but is not obligated to, refuse or delete any content that in our sole discretion is considered inappropriate. 

**Links to Other Sites**

Polo.com may contain links to sites other than our own. Those sites may have their own privacy policy, or no privacy policy at all. Neither we nor any of our service providers have any responsibility for those sites, and we provide these links solely for the convenience of our visitors. Such links may be to advertisers, content providers or other companies who may use our logo and/or style as a result of a co-branding agreement. These sites may send their own cookies to you and may collect information and use it in a way inconsistent with Polo.com's Privacy Policy.

   Privacy Statement of Polo Ralph Lauren Stores  
---  
  
  
At Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation, we believe in providing you, our customer, with services that will improve your shopping experience with us. Consistent with our commitment to providing you a satisfying and helpful shopping experience, we have found that collecting Personal Information through our stores, including but not limited to Ralph Lauren stores, Polo Sport retail stores, Polo Ralph Lauren Factory Stores and Polo Jeans Co. Factory Outlets ("Store(s)"), helps us better understand the products and services most helpful to you, our loyal customer. Our products are also available for sale in Polo shops within many department stores. Data collected in these stores is the property of the department stores and is not provided to Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation. If you have questions about department store privacy policies, please contact the applicable department store. 

The information collected at Polo Ralph Lauren Stores helps us target specific products and services to you. We've created this privacy statement to help you understand how we gather and use this information from our Stores. For information on how we collect and use information collected online, please review our online Privacy Policy at [http://www.polo.com/helpdesk/index.jsp?display=safety&subdisplay=restrictions#onlinePP](http://www.polo.com/helpdesk/index.jsp?display=safety&subdisplay=restrictions#onlinePP). 

**Personal Information Collected at Our Stores**

Our Stores collect Personal Information and personally identifiable transaction information (for example, what you bought). Such Personal Information may be collected from you in a number of ways: 

  * When you purchase products from our Stores, we may collect your name, address, email address, telephone number(s) and credit card information (with the expiration date). In addition, we collect transaction information related to your purchase (what you bought, the price you paid, the payment method you used and if the product was on sale). 
  * When you apply for an account through our Stores, we may also collect income, employment information and credit information, such as credit cards owned by you, in addition to identifying information, such as your name, address, telephone number(s), email address(es), income and employment status. 
  * When you fill out a tailoring order or instruct us to mail product to another location, we may collect your name, address, email address, telephone number and credit card information. 
  * When you fill out any in-store promotional surveys, we may gather certain Personal Information, such as your opinions on specific products and/or services, in addition to identifying information, such as your name, address, telephone number(s), email address(es), income and employment status.

**Aggregate Information Collected at Our Stores**

Our Stores may also collect Aggregate Information about you, such as your age, gender, types of products purchased and the frequency of your visit(s). Aggregate Information is used in a collective manner, so you cannot be directly identified by that compiled information. For example, the number of people who shopped at our Stores who are 25 years of age is Aggregate Information that does not personally identify a specific user. For the purposes of this statement, we refer to such information as "Aggregate Information." 

**Sharing Personal Information and Aggregate Information Collected at Our Stores**

The Personal Information and Aggregate Information collected at our Stores may be shared with Polo.com as well as reputable third-party organizations to contact consumers for marketing and promotional purposes.

In addition, you may call us to become part of the "do-not-share" list at 888-475-7674. 

In addition, we use Acxiom ([www.acxiom.com](http://www.acxiom.com/)) for data processing services relating to the maintenance of our customer database. Acxiom has agreed to maintain our customer information in confidence and to not disclose customer information to any third parties (unless required to do so by law) or use such information for any purpose other than our business.

You can ask us by mail for a summary of any Personal Information that Polo.com has retained about you. Please address your request to Jeffrey Steinberg, Chief Privacy Officer, Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation, 650 Madison Avenue, 12th Floor, New York, NY 10022.
