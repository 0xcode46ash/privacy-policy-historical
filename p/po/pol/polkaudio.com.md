This Privacy Policy Statement sets out our information collection, use and dissemination practices for PolkAudio.com (the "Website"). By visiting any part of the Polk Audio Website you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Statement and hereby grant your consent to collect this information. Please read this Privacy Policy Statement to understand how Polk Audio collects, uses and disseminates information through our Website. 

**What Personal Information About You Does Polk Audio Collect?**  
The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your website browsing and shopping experience. Here are the types of information we gather. 

**Information You Give Us:**  
We receive and store any information you enter on this Website or give us in any other way. This information includes demographic information and contact information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features or conduct transactions. 

**Information Automatically Collected:**  
Polk Audio may also automatically collect non-personal information and data through the use of Cookies. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to enhance your experience using our Website. Through cookies, a website can recognize repeat users, facilitate the user's access to and use of the Website, and allow a site to track usage behavior. Polk Audio does not use cookies to gather personal information about you. Examples of the information we may collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login; e-mail address; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; purchase history, which we sometimes aggregate with similar information from other customers.

The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of our Website's features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on. 

**How is Collected Information Used?**  
We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, fulfilling your orders, customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you. 

**Does Polk Audio Share Information?**  
Polk Audio will never sell your information to others. We share customer information only as described below. We have controls that either are subject to this Privacy Policy Statement or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Statement. 

  * **Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:** For certain transactions we work closely with our affiliated businesses to package, ship and fulfill your order. In other cases, we operate stores, provide services, or sell product lines jointly with these businesses. We may share customer information related to those transactions with third parties. 
  * **Agents:** We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. When you place an order, from time to time we may share your name, mailing address and purchase category information with a few carefully selected marketing partners who may bring you offers of interest. During checkout, you may opt out of receiving marketing information via email. 
  * **Protection of Polk Audio and Others:** We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Polk Audio, our parent company and its shareholders, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy Statement. 



**How Do I Grant Consent?**  
By visiting our Website, you hereby grant consent for Polk Audio to collect the information as set out in this Privacy Policy Statement.

If you are under 18, you may use the Website only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. Polk Audio does not knowingly send direct mailings to anyone under the age of 16.
