# Privacy Policy - Polar Bears International

Polar Bears International respects your **privacy**. We don’t knowingly or willingly share information with any third party about our membership, online gift shop customers, or our website visitors.

**PBI Gift Shop**  
 _Available in Fall 2010_  
PBI collects names, street addresses, contact email addresses, telephone numbers, and credit card information when you make purchases and adoptions on our online store's secure order page. We do not retain credit card information online. We keep a record of personal information derived from orders and donations to the extent required by our auditors to verify our accounting system.

If you place an order, we may use your email or telephone number to request additional information about your order or preferred shipping method, or to notify you of your order status.

We may use your email address or mailing address to send you a free copy of our newsletter and/or information. If you don’t want to receive communications from Polar Bears International, please let us know by marking that option on your personal [contact information form](https://web.archive.org/contact-us), or by using the unsubscribe option on the information you receive. 

**Membership**  
PBI retains names and email and mailing addresses—and all optional information you provide us—in our secure membership database, which we use to keep you informed of PBI business and issues. 

**Log Files**  
PBI’s website server maintains log files that contain IP addresses and/or domain names whenever you request a page. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information and we use information from the log files solely in the aggregate to analyze site traffic and evaluate public interest. The URL of a referring web page may also be logged for the same purpose.

 **Cookies**  
The PBI website uses cookies only for the purposes of authentication (member login) and sending data between pages (state). The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifyable information. The cookie is immediately deleted when you close your browser window.

 **Links**  
This website contains links to other websites. PBI is not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites.

 **Email**  
If you send PBI an email, your return address will be displayed in the header we receive. We will use this information only to answer your inquiry. We may on occasion keep your message as a record of the contact but at no time will we share email information with outside companies or agencies, unless forced to do so by law or court order.

 **Social Networks, Blogs, and Email Threads**  
Any identifying information you post in a social networking site, a blog, or an email will be public information. PBI will make no effort to collect personal information from these sources, but it’s possible that other visitors may record your email address or other information. If this concerns you, please post to post under a pseudonym or with an altered email address.

 **Age**  
PBI may ask you to voluntarily provide your birth date for certain communications programs we invite you to participate in (such as receiving an electronic birthday greeting). You are not required to provide this information unless you choose to participate.

 **PBI Security**  
PBI provides our members and supporters with a secure experience when ordering memberships, making a donation, or purchasing merchandise. Any credit card information you enter on our site is strongly encrypted by industry-standard protocol, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).

We take appropriate precautions to protect the security and privacy of the information stored on our computer networks. Our systems are secure, and access to your data by our employees is limited to a need to know basis, controlled by password protected systems, and monitored for abuse.

**Reviewing Your Information**  
You may contact us at any time to review personal information collected and request revisions. Please direct any questions or comments to:
