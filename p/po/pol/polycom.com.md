**Your Privacy**

At Polycom, we are committed to respecting your privacy. We recognize that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself through our "Services," you trust us to act in a responsible manner. That's why we have put a policy in place to protect your Personal Information. This statement describes (1) the types of Personal Information we collect, (2) how we use and protect this information, and (3) who we disclose it to.

The " ** _Services_** " means any website, mobile application, or Internet service under the control of Polycom, Inc., whether partial or otherwise, in connection with providing an online platform for Polycom's services.

_**"**_ ** _Personal Information_** " means information that alone or when in combination with other information may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you, such as: name, address, email address, or phone number. We do not consider Personal Information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not allow a third party to easily identify a specific individual.

**What information does Polycom collect?**

In general, we collect Personal Information from you when you voluntarily provide it by: (1) providing information to us or our business partners in connection with a transaction or in furtherance of our business relationships; (2) registering products on our website or otherwise contacting us to obtain information relating to our products or our services; (3) signing up to enter a promotion, participate in an event or survey, receive newsletters or other literature; or (4) providing information when we (i.e. our customer service representatives or employees) contact you either at trade events or by other means such as email or phone.

In some cases we collect this information from you directly and we may also receive such information from our business partners (such as resellers) who may collect this information from you in the context of your business relationship with us and/or the business partner.

In connection with these activities, we may collect Personal Information, including, but not limited to, your name, business address, email address, telephone number, fax number, and other contact information, user name and/or password associated with the use of our Services, occupation, company name, name of position within company, the type of product you are seeking, the type and number of products you and your business purchase, and other information necessary to conduct business with you or which we, or our business partners may ask you to provide.

**Cookies, Automatic Data Collection, and Related Technologies.**

When you use our Services we may also collect/obtain certain non-Personal Information from you including, but not limited to, your browser type (e.g., Netscape or Internet Explorer), operating system (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), Internet service provider, IP address, websites visited, and the domain name from which you accessed the Services (e.g., yahoo.com). Like many other commercial websites, our Services may use standard technologies, such as "cookies", web beacons and other HTML tools, to collect information about how you use the Services or to record that you opened an email marketing message. Polycom may also use customized links or other similar technologies to track email links that you click. We may associate that information with your Personal Information in order to provide you more focused service communications.
