Trademark & Copyright information is available at bottom of the Privacy Statement (please scroll down). 

**PRIVACY STATEMENT**  
Polaroid Corporation is committed to protecting the privacy of its consumers. We have put a policy in place to protect your personal information. We encourage you to take the time to read this privacy statement and the privacy statements of any other web site you may visit. 

**What information do we collect?**  
When you visit our web site, Polaroid Corporation will automatically collect general, aggregate information about what you visited on the site through the use of "Cookies" (for more information about cookies, please see section entitled "Cookies" below). Some examples of the types of information we may collect include what links you clicked on, your IP address, files you downloaded onto your computer from the site, search strings you used, locations and products you entered into a dealer locator function, and the length of time you spent on the site. This information is collected for all users and Polaroid Corporation will use it to design more efficient and targeted site content and marketing communications, so that users will be able to more quickly find information important to them. You can adjust your browser if you do not want this information to be collected. Unless you have logged in to the site (told us who you are), this information does not identify you personally. 

Sometimes we may ask you to submit personal information into a form, such as if you would like to register on the site, register for an event, subscribe to a newsletter, submit a request for more information about a product, or purchase a product or service. It is not mandatory to complete a registration form to be able to fully access the site. Depending upon the nature of your request, we will need certain information such as name, address, e-mail address, phone number, zip code, credit card number, and password to fully respond to your request. We also may ask for additional information in the optional fields to better understand your needs and respond to them quickly and efficiently. Some examples of optional fields include fax number, industry, industry specialty, how you found out about Polaroid Corporation, and the best way to contact you. We may use this information to let you know about additional products, services, or events that you might be interested in, or to send you newsletters. You can choose not to receive this information from us by letting us know when you enter your information into the form. 

Information you provide to us by filling out a form may be linked to the more general information obtained about what you visited on our site. This will enable us to provide you with a more customized, individual experience on our site. Polaroid Corporation will not contact you for the purpose of selling or promoting products or services unless we have your permission to do so. Polaroid Corporation may use your personal information to contact you in the event of product recalls, safety notices or terminal production of product service parts, accessories or consumables for products you have indicated you own, whether or not you have given us permission, to make sure you receive this important information. 

Polaroid Corporation uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. With both cookies and Spotlight technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to[http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy]. 

**Credit Card Transactions**  
When you order products/services on-line, your credit card and contact information is used and retained to fulfill your order and process returns. If you have 'registered' at Polaroid Online, your personal information and credit card information is retained to pre-populate this information and speed your check out when you visit again. Polaroid uses SSL encryption software to protect and encrypt the credit card information (number and expiration date) you submit on this web site. **How do I modify personal information?**

If you provide us with information (excluding credit card information) through a registration or other on-line form you will have access to a "modify profile" option in the www.polaroidwork.com site. This option allows you to see all the information we have on file, and gives you an opportunity to change this information. 

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a web server to store on a web browser or a user's hard drive so it can later be read back from that browser or hard drive. Polaroid Corporation uses both permanent and "in-session" cookies. The cookies do not contain any personal information but may be tied to the personal information you choose to provide to us. A permanent cookie is one that is placed on a user's browser. You can adjust your browser so that it does not accept cookies, or you can choose to delete the cookie from your browser. An "in-session" cookie means that the information (cookie) is only read back from your browser while you are visiting the site and then expires. It is not used to recognize you on later visits. For example, if you log in during your visit to the site, "in-session" cookies enable the system to maintain this information throughout your visit so that you don't have to log in again while you are on the site. Polaroid Corporation uses both types of cookies to enable us to collect aggregate information usage patterns of our site, such as what areas of the site are visited most often, so we can tailor our site to user preferences. This means that when you log into the site using your user name and password, information about what you visit on the site, while you are logged in, will be linked to the personal information that you provided to us. This information will enable us to provide you with a more customized experience on our site. If you choose to visit the site without logging in, then information about what you visit on the site is only collected on an anonymous, aggregate basis, and is not tied to your personal information. 

**Sharing**  
Polaroid Corporation will share aggregated site usage information with its subsidiaries, partners and affiliates to aid in continued development of the website. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. We engage fulfillment houses to provide specific services. When you request additional information from us, we may share names or other contact information that is necessary for the fulfillment house to provide these services. For credit card transactions, we send your name, address, state and zip code and credit card information (i.e. credit card type, number, and expiration date) to CyberSource to process transactions and as necessary to prevent or detect fraud. For certain sweepstakes and promotions, third parties collect and process data for the purpose of fulfilling the sweepstakes and promotions. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. Polaroid Corporation has links to other sites on its web site. Polaroid Corporation will pass the URL of the exit page of the Polaroid web site to the new site. This information will be captured in a database and will be used to help provide you with appropriate content and to analyze the effectiveness of Polaroid's linking strategies. These other sites include dealer sites that may collect credit card and shipping information to process your orders. Polaroid Corporation is not responsible for the privacy practices of other such sites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of these other web sites that collect personal information. Polaroid Corporation will only share your name and contact information (street and email addresses) with other parties for marketing purposes if we have your specific permission to do so. 

**Security**  
While Polaroid Corporation uses SSL encryption in connection with credit card transactions, we also do everything in our power, and take every precaution, to protect users' other information. For instance, the information is only accessible by a limited number of employees, who need access to the information to perform a specific job, such as a database administrator or a business manager. Authorized employees may only access the information through the use of a user name and password. In addition, the servers that we store information on are kept in a secure, locked environment that is staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 

**Contact us**  
If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, you can contact us by sending an email to webteam@polaroid.com. 

**Privacy Policy changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy for this web site, we will post those changes here so you will always know what information we collect, how we use it, and who we share it with.
