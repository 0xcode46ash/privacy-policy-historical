  * Q: What information do we share?
  * A:We share your information only as described below: 
    * Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We work closely with affiliated businesses, generally licensees of the Polaroid brand and their fulfillment partners who sell their products on Polaroid.com. In other cases, we operate stores, provide services or sell product lines jointly with these businesses. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share customer information related to those transactions with that third party. Third-Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. These third parties have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but are not authorized to use it for purposes beyond their engagement or transmit it beyond their usage.
    * Promotions: From time to time we may send offers to selected groups of Polaroid.com customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive these types of offers from Polaroid.com, please adjust your preferences in your account.
    * Mergers or Business Transactions: As we continue to grow our business, we might enter into agreements to buy or sell businesses or assets, including customer information. If customer information is sold, it remains subject to the promises made in the applicable Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). It is also possible that Polaroid.com could be acquired along with its customer information.
    * Legal Protection: It may become necessary for us to release account and other personal information if we believe the release is necessary or required for us to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request; (ii) enforce our Terms and Conditions or other policies or agreements; (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or (iv) protect the rights, property or safety of Polaroid.com, our owners, service providers, licensees, users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include our selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing your person information in violation of this Privacy Policy.

    * Third Parties Links and Advertisements: Polaroid.com may have third party advertising and links to other websites. We do not share any personally identifiable information about you to these advertisers or third party websites. You should be aware that some of these third party websites and advertisers (or services working at their request) may use technology that sends the advertisements to your browser, and as a result they receive your internet address when this happens. In addition, they may use cookies, tags, beacons, JavaScript or other technologies to measure the performance of advertisements to customize the advertisements. Polaroid.com does not have the right to access or control such practices and such information is not subject to this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you contact these third party websites and advertisers directly if you would like more information about their privacy practices. If you prefer that we do not use your personal information to allow third parties to personalize advertisements for you, please adjust your preferences in your account.
