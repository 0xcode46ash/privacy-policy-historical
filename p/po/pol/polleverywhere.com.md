## FAQs

### What is "personal information" and "non-personal information"?

"Personal information" identifies a Visitor or User or otherwise contains personally identifiable information provided by or obtained from Poll Everywhere's Visitors or Users. "Non-personal information" does not, by itself, identify the Visitor or User as a specific individual. Rather, non-personal information provides technical data, such as an IP address and browser information that may provide information about your computer or your interaction with Poll Everywhere.

### What information does Poll Everywhere collect from Visitors to Poll Everywhere?

Poll Everywhere only collects non-personal information from Visitors to the Site or mobile Site. Therefore, Visitors may access both while remaining generally anonymous to Poll Everywhere. Visitors commonly chose to provide personal information however as part of using our service, such as answering a poll that asks for a Visitor's name.

### What information does Poll Everywhere collect from Registered Users?

To register to use some parts of the Service, you must provide a full name and email address. To purchase service, we require your credit card information unless we've agreed in writing to other means of payment. Poll Everywhere only collects this personal information if a Visitor chooses to register with the Service to become a Registered User. We may collect information related to how you logged in (e.g., whether through a mobile app or a browser) so we can alert you to new features about the Service.

Poll Everywhere may use your registration information to contact you to: deliver the Service and improve our Site, Service, features and content, and provide customer service; administer and enable your use, enjoyment and navigation of our Site, Service, and mobile Site; better understand your needs and interests; fulfill requests you make; and personalize your experience. However, we will never use your data to have third party things marketed to you unless we decide to offer this option, and you choose to enable it.

### Who can see my polls?

By default, the polls you create and their results are indexed by search engines, and searchable by other Poll Everywhere users. You can disable this in your settings.

Even if you have enabled the privacy setting to prevent indexing, every poll our our system is assigned a permanent, private, obscure link. This is called a "permalink". If you share the permalink with others, they will be able to see your poll and a limited subset of data about the responses. If you've chosen to allow it, they will be able to submit responses.

### What is a cookie?

They are permitted to use data only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf or at an aggregate level. Notable third party services you should be aware of include Facebook and their "like" button, and web analytics providers like Google Analytics.

Some features may expose your presence on the service. For example, if you are interacting with a poll form a presenter, they can see your responses. If you give them permission, they can also associate your responses with your Name and email address.

### Is there an age restriction for joining Poll Everywhere?

### When might Poll Everywhere have to disclose my personal information?

Other than sharing with our select service providers as explained above, we will only disclose personal information in the following limited circumstances relating to abuse or misuse of the Service, or legal process.

  1. If Poll Everywhere believes in good faith that you have misused or abused the Service, or attempted to interfere with or harm our Service, we will investigate and cooperate with appropriate law enforcement, including, if necessary or appropriate, by disclosing your name, registration data or IP address and any other relevant information, to protect our rights or property, or those of our Visitors, Users, corporate partners, and others. We will cooperate fully with any legal process or criminal investigation into the misuse or abuse of our Services. As noted above, the servers used in the operation of the Site and Service automatically identify a computer by its IP address.

### What practices does Poll Everywhere follow to secure my information?

The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow standard industry practices to protect Users' personal information, both during transmission and once we receive it.
