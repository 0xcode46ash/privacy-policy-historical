### 1\. The PoliticsNJ.com Online Privacy Policy

PoliticsNJ.com collects data, including personally identifying information, from people who use the politicsnj.com Web site. This section of our privacy policy explains how we collect and use this data. 

#### Information we collect and how we use it

When you visit the PoliticsNJ.com Web site, PoliticsNJ.com collects several forms of usage data, including:

  * Log data. Our servers automatically record certain information sent by your browser, such as your Web request, your Internet Protocol address, your referring URL, your browser type and language, and the date and time of your request.
  * Cookie data. When you visit the PoliticsNJ.com Web site, PoliticsNJ.com or one of our affiliates or third-party partners may send one or more "cookies"â€”small files containing a string of charactersâ€”to your computer to identify you as a unique user. If you have registered with PoliticsNJ.com, the information in your cookie is used to provide a more personalized experience on our site, for example by allowing you to customize portions of the site. If you haven't registered, the cookie identifies you as a unique user and helps ensure a smoother experience on the site, such as by limiting the number of times that you see certain subscription offers. If you have not registered on our site, we cannot link the user ID in the cookie with personal identifying information and data about you, such as your name or e-mail address.
  * Traffic and advertising data. Other cookies without personally identifying information and data are used to enable the Observer Media Group, LLC to gather and analyze site traffic and usage information, and to allow our advertising partners to manage the advertisements presented. These cookies sometimes work in conjunction with other techniques, such as clear GIFs or pixel tags; they do not contain personally identifying information, but they may gather information about what sites you have visited and use that information to determine which ads appear when you visit the PoliticsNJ.com site.



Browsers or third-party software can allow you to block the use of cookies while you surf our site. Or you can use third-party anonymizer services to mask information in your cookies or even general data such as your IP address. In such cases you would not be able to take advantage of most of the personalization services offered on the PoliticsNJ.com Web site.

The aggregated information we collect is used for a number of purposes including the following:

  1. To improve the content and design of the PoliticsNJ.com Web site.
  2. To enable audit bureaus and third party advertisers to verify our claims of traffic to the site.
  3. To help advertisers, potential advertisers or marketers assess the suitability of the site for their ad campaigns.
  4. To help us understand more about the interests of our users, so that we can offer goods and services we believe may be of interest.



Many portions of the PoliticsNJ.com site can be used without registering or giving us any personal information such as (but not limited to) your name and e-mail address. However, the Observer Media Group does collect personally identifying information regarding our online users, including in the following ways:

  * When you provide it to us, such as (but not limited to) by entering a contest, becoming a registered member, signing up for a newsletter or tutorial, or otherwise contacting us.
  * When you provide it to a company that powers a portion of our site or provides a special feature, such as a contest registration, that appears on our site.
  * When you provide information about yourself or your company to PoliticsNJ.com, or when you provide information to any Observer Media Group affiliate, that information may be included in your PoliticsNJ.com user record, if one exists.
  * If you have previously registered with another Observer Media Group affiliate and you begin to fill out certain forms on the PoliticsNJ.com Web site, the site may recognize you and automatically complete the form, and this auto-fill data will then be included in your PoliticsNJ.com user record.
  * If you have provided information to PoliticsNJ.com or any site owned by the Observer Media Group, from time to time we may enhance that information with other information that we collect from third-party sources.



The personal information we collect may be used in a number of ways, including the following:

  * To improve the content of the PoliticsNJ.com site, including by allowing the PoliticsNJ.com editors to consult with readers.
  * To communicate with users about registration and other customer service issues.
  * To promote products and services of the Observer Media Group as described in more detail below.
  * To conduct research surveys on behalf of the Observer Media Group, and its subsidiaries and affiliates.



#### Information sharing

The Observer Media Group may share aggregated, nonpersonal information, such as Web site traffic figures, with third parties. This aggregated information does not identify you individually. We may share personal information with your consent or in order to provide products or services you have requested. In addition, by using the site you agree that we may also share personal information in any of the following circumstances:

  * We may use or disclose personal information if we have a good-faith belief that the disclosure is reasonably necessary (a) to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request, (b) to enforce agreements we have with you, (c) to address fraud or security issues, or (d) to protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of the Observer Media Group or our employees or customers.
