“send a postcard and receive a postcard back from a random person somewhere in the world!”

## Postcrossing Privacy Policy

  


### Your personal information is important to us

The Postcrossing Project recognises the importance of your privacy and that you have the right to control how your personal information is collected and used. We know that providing personal information is an act of trust and we take that seriously. Unless you directly give us consent to do otherwise, we will only collect and use your personal information as explained in this privacy policy.

### Collected information

We will not collect or monitor any personal information without your consent. The only personal information we collect is the information provided by you at the time of signup and whenever you edit your profile. This information will only be used for fulfilling the postcard exchange objective of the website and to improve the content of our Web page.

The postal address you supply to us will only be used for the postcard exchange as explained in the "About" page. At any moment, you are free to stop using Postcrossing and, if you so wish, to remove your account at [http://www.postcrossing.com/removal](https://web.archive.org/removal).

We will use your email address only for the purpose of notifying you of events related with the exchange of postcards. We may also periodically email you a newsletter with news and updates about the website. You can choose not to receive our newsletter by unchecking the option in your profile.

If you contact us, we may maintain a record of the history of the entire communication.

### Children under the age of 13

Users under the age of 13 are allowed to use Postcrossing only under the supervision of an adult and due consent of a parent or legal guardian. We believe children can learn a great deal with Postcrossing, but like with any other website, their online habits should be monitored closely by an adult.
