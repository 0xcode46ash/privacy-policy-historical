We are committed to protecting the privacy of our visitor’s personally identifiable information. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is used.

Your privacy is critically important to us. If you give us your name, email address, or other information, we will use it to communicate with you regarding your order status or to share other resources and offers.

You can unsubscribe from any communications from us at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link found at the bottom of every automated email we send.

Most payments are processed through 1ShoppingCart. which uses the most advanced SSL Encrypted Security technology available so your information is always secure. See the “Security” link for more details.

**What Information We Collect and How We Use It**

Personally Identifiable Information – When supplying your information or by placing an order for products or services, we collect certain types of personally identifiable information including contact information, such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, Credit card and ID verification information, and bank account information as applicable.

We use this information to process requests for products and services by way of customer support for your guaranteed satisfaction. We also use collected information to communicate with you, such as to notify you (through e-mails, SMS text messages, and newsletters) about updates to products, to send you order confirmations, or to provide you with important product warranty or safety information.

In addition, we use contact information you provide to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you, by means of e-mail or through our newsletter, additional products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you.

Supplementation of Information – We may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect online with outside records (e.g., information from our Strategic Partners or from wireless providers) to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you, and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.

We are able to offer our services to you, in part, based on your willingness to be reached by our third party advertisers. We may sell our user information and/or join together with other businesses to bring selected opportunities to our members. By allowing us to make the information you supply available to these third parties, you are able to receive free information on products and services that may be of interest to you. We will use contact information from your registration data to send you information about our products and services and to keep you informed of our other products and services that may be of interest to you. This information may also be shared with third party advertisers who may contact you by means of e-mail, telephone, SMS text message, or other sources of marketing. We do not control, and are not responsible for, the practices of our third-party advertisers.

By submitting your e-mail address at the Website or the website of one of our marketing partners, and/or obtaining services from us, you agree to receive e-mail or telephone calls, SMS text message,or other marketing from us and/or our third-party advertisers notwithstanding a prior decision, made by you, to opt out of this or any other of our or a third party affiliate of ours program, pursuant to the CAN-SPAM Act, you are agreeing to opt back in and to receive marketing materials until you decide to opt-out. In addition, you agree that such act constitutes a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 CFR §310 et seq. (the “ATSR”). Notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission’s Do-Not-Call List, We retain the right to contact you via telemarketing or SMS text message in accordance with the ATSR. Moreover, by registering with, or requesting information from, a third-party advertiser at or through the Website or other advertisement media made available by us (e.g., email marketing), such action shall constitute a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application with the respective third-party advertiser for purposes of the ATSR and you may be contacted via email, direct mail, SMS text message, and/or telemarketing by such third-party advertiser in accordance with the ATSR.

**Sharing of Your information**

In addition, if you access donttreadhere.com through a third-party site, such as one of our Strategic Partners’ sites, we also may need to report certain personally identifiable information (e.g., name and e-mail address) back to that Web site. As we explain further below in the section that follows, we will tell you at the point of collection if we will share personally identifiable information with the Strategic Partner through which you access the HomeMailGroup.com website.

In addition, we will share aggregated demographic information with our Strategic Partners. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.

Our Collection of Personally Identifiable Information Through a Third-party Web Site

To provide you with content and service, we have relationships with many of the best service and content companies. As a result of these relationships, you can access HomeMailGroup.com through a third-party Web site. You can recognize most of the HomeMailGroup.com pages on these third-party sites by looking for the joint branding of HomeMailGroup.com and a third-party company. For example, if you see a logo on the page that says “Powered by HomeMailGroup.com,” you are on a co-branded page.

Whenever you provide registration information on a co-branded page, that data may be shared with the third-party site through which you access HomeMailGroup.com. If personally identifiable information may be provided to such a third party, we will inform you at the point of collection and provide you with an opportunity to tell us not to share your personally identifiable information. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of such third parties, as this Notice does not cover their use of information.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about our visitors when you visit many of our Web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows ‘98 or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, EarthLink).

We use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our service pages and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze service usage.

**Legal Process/Disclaimer**

We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena or a law enforcement agency’s request.

**Choices/Opt Out**

If you prefer not to receive marketing information or wish to fully deactivate your account information from us, simply let us know by choosing this OPT OUT link, or by sending a letter via certified mail to Home Mail Group.com – 334 East Bay St #218. Charleston SC 29401. Attn: Customer Service Manager. Please note that even if you chose to opt out of DontTreadHere.com’s marketing, we will continue to send you important service-related communications (e.g., order confirmation or product safety information). However, these are not promotional in nature.

**Cookies**

To enhance your experience with our site, we may use “cookies.” Cookies are used by your computer’s browser to store your preferences. We use both session and persistent cookies. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at one of our sites.

We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our sites. If you set your browser not to accept cookies, you will still be able to use our site.

**Links**

In addition, our site contains links to other Web sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Our privacy policy does not cover these third parties’ use of information. Visitors should consult the other companies’ and sites’ privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

**Security**

We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.

All information submitted is protected by our secure server, which automatically encrypts your personally identifiable information so that it cannot be read while traveling over the Internet.

**Reviewing Your Information**

If you would like to review and update or correct the personally identifiable information that we have collected from you online, simply send your request via certified mail to Home Mail Group.com – 334 East Bay St #218. Charleston SC 29401. Attn: Customer Service Manager. To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.

**Notification of Changes**

If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a materially different manner from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify you directly (e.g., via e-mail). You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the change. However, if you have opted out of communication with the site then you will not be contacted, nor will your personal information be used in this new manner.
