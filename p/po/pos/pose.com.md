### Gathering of Non-Personally-Identifying Information

Company collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Company's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Company.s visitors use its Service. From time to time, Company may share non-personally-identifying information with others in the aggregate, e.g., reports on trends in the usage of its Service, but this information does not identify any individual users. 

Company also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Pose posts. Company only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, [except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.] 

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

You may choose to interact with Company or the Service in ways that require Company to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Company gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask to input your twitter information to be able to share information via your twitter account. In each case, Company collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor.s interaction with Company or the Service. Company does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

If you are a registered user of the Service and have supplied your email address, Company may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what.s going on with Company and the Service.

Company recognizes the importance of safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. Accordingly, we employ reasonable measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

From time to time, we may establish a business relationship with other businesses whom we believe trustworthy and who have confirmed that their privacy practices are consistent with ours ("Service Providers"). For example, we may contract with Service Providers to provide certain services, such as hosting and maintenance, data storage and management, and marketing and promotions. We only provide our Service Providers with the information necessary for them to perform these services on our behalf. Each Service Provider must agree to use reasonable security procedures and practices, appropriate to the nature of the information involved, in order to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Service Providers are prohibited from using such information other than as specified by Company.
