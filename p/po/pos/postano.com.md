# TigerLogic Corporation - Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes our practices regarding how we at TigerLogic Corporation (“ **we** ” or “ **us** ”) collect, use, and share information we obtain through your use of our websites located at www.tigerlogic.com, www.yolink.com and www.postengine.com, as well as any of our other websites, email messages, or software containing a link to this Privacy Policy (each, a “ **Site** ”), and any products or services offered through any of our Sites (collectively, our “ **Sites and Services** ”). Some of the information governed by this Privacy Policy is anonymous, whereas other information is personally identifiable, such as your first and last name, email address, telephone number, or credit card number (“ **Personally Identifiable Information** ” or “ **PII** ”). **By using any of our Sites and Services, you are accepting the terms described in this Privacy Policy and explicitly consent to the use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.**

Please note that this Privacy Policy does not govern our use of any information you provide to us when you call us, write to us, or communicate with us in any manner other than through our Sites and Services. 

This Privacy Policy is effective as of June 15, 2011.

  1. **European Union Users**. 

    1. _**Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**_. YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO OUR PROCESSING OF YOUR PII ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. YOUR PII MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AND IN THE UNITED STATES; UNITED STATES LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF YOUR PII MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.

    2. _**Organizations**_. If you represent an organization, you will ensure that each member of your organization (including employees and contractors) about whom PII may be provided to us has given express consent to our processing of such PII ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY.

  2. **Data Collection and Use**. 

    1. _**Your Data Submissions.**_ We collect any PII or other information you may choose to submit through our Sites and Services. Any PII that is provided by you through our Sites and Services will be used for the purposes of: (i) providing you with the products or services you have requested; (ii) updating and enhancing our records; (iii) contacting you (via email, telephone, or fax) regarding us, our Sites and Services, or other products or services that may be of interest to you; (iv) enforcing our rights and the rights of third parties; and, (v) investigating and ensuring compliance with our Terms of Use and other agreements relating to our Sites and Services.

    2. _**Data Collection by Us**_. We may also collect information (using your IP address or “cookies”) relating to the way you use our Sites and Services, such as what pages you visit, what information you search for, or what type of browser you are using. However, this type of information is not associated with your PII. Instead, we use this anonymous data to operate and improve our Sites and Services. For example, we may use anonymous data to identify which Sites and Services especially interest our users as a group or analyze other trends that can help us improve the quality of our services. A “cookie” is a small piece of information stored on your hard drive, not on our Sites, that enables our systems to recognize your browser. Cookies allow us to better understand how our users, including you, use our Sites and Services, which in turn helps us focus our resources on features that are most popular with our users. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but in that case, some portions of our Sites and Services may not operate properly. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases, your IP address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP address probably varies from session to session. IP addresses allow us, for example, to better understand the demographics of our users. 

    3. _**Data Collection by Third Parties**_. Some of the advertisers and other businesses that advertise or display other content on or through our Sites and Services may use cookies and may place a cookie on your computer. In addition, we may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads. These companies may: (i) use information obtained from your use of our Sites and other sites to serve ads to you, and (ii) place unique, third-party cookies on your browser. We also may use “web beacons” provided by third-party advertising companies, which enable us to recognize your browser when a cookie has been placed on your computer to help optimize the advertising you receive. Some, but not all, third-party advertising companies provide a mechanism to opt-out of their technology. The information collected by third-party cookies is subject to the privacy policy of that third party, not this Privacy Policy. 

  3. **Promotions.** From time to time, you may be given the opportunity to participate in sweepstakes, contests, giveaways, or other promotions offered by us, either alone or with promotional partners. Participation in these promotions may require you to submit information about you, including PII. Our use and sharing of your information collected through a promotion will be governed by the official rules or agreement governing that promotion, as well as by this Privacy Policy. The terms of those rules or that agreement will control over any conflicting provisions of this Privacy Policy.

  4. **Sharing User Information**.

    1. _**Third Party Service Providers.**_ We use third parties (including contractors and service providers) to help with certain aspects of our operations, which may require disclosure of your PII to them. For example, we may use a third party to: (i) communicate with you (via telephone, email or mail) about our Sites and Services; (ii) send information to you; (iii) process and collect payment from your credit card (if applicable); (iv) help us collect data relating to your use of our Sites and Services; or, (v) perform other work that we may need to outsource. We require these third parties to use your PII only as necessary to perform the services we ask them to perform. However, when third parties help us to collect data relating to your use of our Sites and Services, they may set their own cookies to collect that data. In those circumstances, those third party cookies and the use of such data by those third parties are governed by the privacy policies of those third parties, not this Privacy Policy.

    2. _**Affiliates**_. We may share some or all of your information with our existing or future parents, subsidiaries, joint venturers, or companies under common control with us (and with the advisors for each), in which case each will be required to honor this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires our company (or a business unit of ours that uses your personal information), that company will possess the personal information collected by us and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. 

    3. _**Aggregated Data.**_ We may share aggregated anonymous data concerning our users with business partners and others interested in how our Sites and Services are used. We do not disclose that aggregated data in a way that is linked to your PII. 

    4. _**Advertisers and Promotional Partners**_. We share anonymous information with advertisers and other persons with whom we conduct business, and those persons may also share with us other aggregated, non-identifying information that they have developed or acquired independently. From time to time, we may also share your PII or anonymous information with promotional partners or other third parties so they may contact you regarding goods or services in which you may be interested, but we provide you with the means to opt-out of that type of sharing as described below in this privacy policy.

    5. _**Public Information**_ **.** If you identify any information, including PII, as public, you are authorizing us to share such information publicly. Also, there may be areas of our Sites (e.g., reviews, comments, and online forums) in which you are able to post information that will be available to all other users of our Sites. By choosing to use these areas, you understand and agree that anyone may access, use, and disclose any information that you post to those areas. 

    6. _**Other Disclosure Scenarios.**_ Notwithstanding anything in this Privacy Policy to the contrary, we reserve the right, and you hereby expressly authorize us, to share any PII or anonymous data about your usage: (i) to comply with applicable law, including in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, to address written complaints of copyright infringement; (ii) to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, including to enforce our Terms of Use or any other agreement relating to our Sites and Services; (iii) if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person or property, including our own; (iv) if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding significant abuse of any of our Sites and Services or the Internet in general (such as voluminous spamming, denial of service attacks, or attempts to compromise the security of information); (v) if we become the subject of bankruptcy proceedings, in which case we may share information about you and your usage with a bankruptcy trustee, debtor in possession, or subsequent purchaser of assets.

  5. **Choice / Opt-Out.** We offer you the opportunity to control whether we may use your PII to send you promotional and marketing messages and whether we may share your information with our promotional partners. You may opt out of such messages or sharing at any time by following the instructions provided in each such message you receive from us or by emailing us at [privacy@tigerlogic.com](mailto:privacy@tigerlogic.com). Please note that these requests may take up to ten (10) business days to process. Even if you request not to be contacted by us, we reserve the right to use your contact information if we consider it necessary to send you crucial information about those of our products and services which you have purchased or used, or information about changes to this Privacy Policy.

  6. **Revising Your Personally Identifiable Information.** We retain your PII at our discretion and in accordance with applicable laws. However, we do not undertake any retention obligations, and may dispose of information in our discretion without notice, subject to applicable law that specifically requires the handling or retention of PII. You must keep your own, separate back-up records. If you would like to modify or delete from our database any PII you previously submitted to us, you may email us at [privacy@tigerlogic.com](mailto:privacy@tigerlogic.com). We will use our commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill your request in a timely manner. However, even if we delete such PII from our ‘live’ database, it may still be stored on other databases (including those kept for archival purposes). We may keep a record of all information that is changed or deleted, and we may determine what may be changed or deleted. For example, if we are required to keep track of certain kinds of transactions, you may be prevented from changing or deleting information relevant for those transactions. Please note that if you delete certain information, you may not be able to use certain features of our Sites and Services in the future without re-submitting such information. We are not responsible for removing information about you from the databases of any third parties to whom we were authorized to disclose your information prior to processing a request from you. 

  7. **Security.** We use industry-standard methods of securing our electronic databases of your Personally Identifiable Information. We limit access to PII stored by us to those persons in our organization who have a business need for such access. However, you should know that no company, including ours, can fully eliminate security risks associated with the disclosure of PII. Neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit crimes, make mistakes, or fail to follow policies. As a result, while your privacy is very important to us, we cannot fully ensure that your PII will not be disclosed to third parties. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty with respect to your information, you agree that the standard used to measure our compliance with that duty will be one of intentional misconduct. 

  8. **Links.** Our Sites and Services may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any such other websites and urge you to review such practices prior to submitting any information to such websites.

  9. **Children’s Privacy.** We are committed to protecting the privacy needs of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s online activities and interests. Our Sites and Services are not intended for and may not be used by children under the age of thirteen (13). We do not knowingly collect information from children and we do not target our Sites and Services to children.

  10. **Modifications.** We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by sending you a notice of the amended policy to the email address you have submitted to us (if applicable), in which case you agree to the amended version if you do not contact us to inform us otherwise, or by posting the amended version on relevant areas of our Sites. Any modified version of this Privacy Policy will be effective as of the date set forth in the modified version. If you continue to use any of our Sites and Services after the effective date of a modification, you will be deemed to have read, understood and agreed to the Privacy Policy as modified.

  11. **Contact Information.** If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us by e mail at [privacy@tigerlogic.com](mailto:privacy@tigerlogic.com). To send us a legal notice, mail it by certified mail (return receipt requested) to: TigerLogic Corporation. (Attn: Legal Department), 25A Technology Drive, Irvine, California 92618. When we need to contact you, we may do so to an email address that we have on file for you, or we may post a notice on our Sites and Services. This includes any notices that we may be required to send you by law, such as those regarding the breach of any security systems.
