# Postini Privacy Policy

**Postini Privacy Policy**

Postini is committed to honoring the privacy of our users and visitors. By making our Privacy Policy available, users can make informed consent to participate in Postini service offerings. Our information practices are described as follows: 

**Identification Kept Secure**  
Postini does not require that Postini users provide personal contact or demographic information. Postini obtains pertinent information about your email account through our partnerships with your existing email service provider. Users have the ability to turn off Postini services. Once this action is taken, Postini will not attempt to direct the messages though Postini services. 

Postini will not sell or make available the list of Postini users to any third party. 

**Configuration Information**  
Postini will assign user passwords that match your current email account. This information will not be released to any party other than Postini or authorized personnel of your email service provider except as required for law enforcement purposes. 

Configuration information and email messages that are directed to the Postini Message Center are not reviewed by any individual. User-specific information will remain strictly confidential. User configuration information provided to Postini will be used explicitly to deliver services that match your requirements and not for any other purpose. 

All email message information including contents, addresses, categorization, and IP addresses will be kept strictly confidential. Postini and your email service provider will deliver services that comply with the existing service agreement between users and the email service provider. 

Postini sets strict security policies and access rights to protect against loss, misuse, and alteration of messages stored on the Postini servers. 

**Voluntary Identification Information**  
Postini allows website visitors to voluntarily offer their contact information for a qualified Postini employee to contact them to explore a business relationship. 

Website visitors can also offer feedback, but personal information is not required. The information collected from "feedback" will only be used to reply to the users questions, comments, or needs. Of those who offer personal information, a small sample may be used by Postini to request their participation in usability studies. The personal information will never be shared with parties outside of Postini. 

**Cookie Usage**  
Website traffic patterns are often tracked through the use of cookies. Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. Cookies are harmless identifiers that contain no personal information, but merely identify the visitor as a unique visitor. Postini may assign cookies as a means to monitor site traffic patterns. The cookie will allow Postini to track information such as frequency of visits to the website and general traffic patterns. This information enables Postini website managers to create logical site structure and more relevant content. In some instances, we may use a cookie to store your username and password to ease site navigation processes.
