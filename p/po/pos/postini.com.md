We are committed to honoring the privacy of our users and visitors. By publishing our Privacy Statement, we allow users to make informed consent to participate in our service offerings. 

**Personal Information Obtained through Email Service Providers**  
Postini does not require its users to provide personal contact or demographic information. We obtain pertinent information about your email account through our partnership with your existing email service provider. You can deactivate your services at any time by turning your application settings to the OFF position. Once you do so, new services will not be added to your account. 

Postini never sells or makes available individual names, lists of users, or aggregate data to any third parties for gain. We will not accept customer or end-user information that your email provider may have collected. 

Postini's web tracking software is used to analyze traffic to this website. Postini does not create individual profiles for visitors. Unlike some tracking services, our software does not have a database of individual profiles for each visitor. Postini only collects aggregate data.

**Passwords and Message Content**  
Passwords are never released to any party other than authorized personnel of your email service provider, except as required for law enforcement purposes. 

User configurations and email messages are processed automatically by software, so humans do not review this information.

All user-specific information and email message information—including content, addresses, categorizations, and IP addresses—is kept strictly confidential. Postini delivers only services that comply with the existing service agreement between you and your email service provider. 

**Framed Environments**  
In occurrences where email providers display the Message Center in a "framed" environment, Postini cannot guarantee the privacy practices of that customer. In order for users to update their service information users will need to contact their existing email service provider. 

**Email Communications**  
Postini will notify users via email when viruses are quarantined in the Message Center. Reminders of your quarantined junk email are also emailed on a regular schedule that is determined by your email provider.

Postini allows website visitors to contact us directly with questions or comments. The information collected via email is used only to reply to questions, comments, or requests.
