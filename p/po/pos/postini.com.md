# Postini Privacy Statement

   


  
Postini is committed to honoring the privacy of our users and visitors. By publishing our Privacy Statement, we allow users to make informed consent to participate in Postini service offerings. 

The Postini information disclosure practices are described in the following sections. 

**Personal Information**  
Postini does not require its users to provide personal contact or demographic information. We obtain pertinent information about your email account through our partnership with your existing email service provider. You can deactivate your Postini services at any time. Once you do so, Postini will not attempt to add Postini services to your email. 

Postini never sells or makes available individual names or list of Postini users to any third parties. 

**Passwords and Message Content**  
Postini passwords are never released to any party other than Postini or authorized personnel of your email service provider, except as required for law enforcement purposes. 

User configurations and email messages are processed automatically by software, so humans do not review this information. User configuration information provided to Postini is used explicitly to deliver services that match your requirements and not for any other purpose. All user-specific information and email message information—including content, addresses, categorizations, and IP addresses—is kept strictly confidential. Postini delivers only services that comply with the existing service agreement between you and your email service provider. 

**Volunteered Information**  
Postini allows website visitors to contact us directly with questions or comments, but personal information is not required. The information collected via email is used only to reply to questions, comments, or requests. 

We try to read and reply to every message. Sometimes we file your comments, so that we can improve the site and program in the future. A small sample of users who contact us may be invited to participate in usability studies. Personal information collected during these studies is never shared with parties outside of Postini. 

**Cookie Usage**  
Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to identify you. Cookies only contain your email address. Postini also assigns cookies to track information such as frequency of visits to the website and general site traffic patterns. This information enables Postini website managers to create a logical site structure and more relevant content. In some cases, we may use a cookie to store your user name and password to ease site navigation processes. 

**Advertising**  
Postini works with a third party to serve ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. This policy only covers the use of cookies by Postini and does not cover the use of cookies by advertisers. Postini does not have control, nor access to the information contained in its advertisers' cookies. To find out more about our advertising policy, contact [feedback@postini.com](mailto:feedback@postini.com)

**Linked Sites**  
This website contains links to other sites. Postini is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website. 

**Legal Disclaimer**  
We may disclose personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on our website. 

[**Security Statement**](https://web.archive.org/company/security.html)  
Postini sets strict security policies and access rights to protect against loss, misuse, and alteration of messages stored on Postini servers. Our security policy is backed by VeriSign, a leading provider of Internet trust services. To learn more, check out the Postini full security statement.
