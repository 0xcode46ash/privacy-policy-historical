This "Web Site" is sponsored and hosted by Digital Chicago, Inc. Click here for a list of the Web Sites governed by Digital Chicago's Privacy Policy and [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20020602025302id_/http%3A//www.post-trib.com/netuse/terms.html) (collectively, "Digital Chicago" or "we" or "us"). Digital Chicago respects the privacy of its users. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use your information, and your choices. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. In addition, please review our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20020602025302id_/http%3A//www.post-trib.com/netuse/terms.html), which governs your use of Digital Chicago's Web Sites. Your use of our Web Site indicates to us that you have read and accept our privacy practices, as outlined in this Privacy Policy. 

**General**

While on our Web Site, you may encounter links to other Web sites or online materials. For example, you may encounter links from sponsors or partners, which may include Digital Chicago's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. If you "click" on a link to such a third party, the "click" takes you off our Web Site and to a third party's Web site, which is beyond Digital Chicago's control. These other Web sites may set their own cookies, collect data, and/or have their own privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only covers information collected by Digital Chicago, and we encourage you to review the privacy policy of any other Web site you visit.

In addition, please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you may disclose publicly in user forums (such as chat rooms, bulletin boards, or similar Web pages). You should keep in mind that whenever you publicly disclose information about yourself online - for example, via message boards or chat rooms - that information could be collected and used by people that you do not know. In addition, certain message boards (and similar user forums) may display IP addresses along with the message poster's name and message. Digital Chicago bears no responsibility for any action or policies of any third parties who collect any information users may disclose in user forums or other public areas, if any, of this Web Site. 

**Information Digital Chicago Collects**

Personally Identifiable Information: We may ask you to provide us with personal information about yourself, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally (such as your name, address, birth date or e-mail address), which we refer to as "PII," at various times and at various places on this Web Site, such as when you register for newsletters, subscribe to the Sun Times, or choose to participate in a contest, sweepstakes or survey. We may also ask you to provide us with demographic information or information regarding your interests, hobbies or similar information. In addition, as part of our current and planned services, we may, at any time, add features to our Web Site that require you to register or otherwise provide PII, including credit card information, or we may require registration or a subscription fee to gain access to any portion of our Web Site. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in many of the Web Site's features. If we provide the opportunity for you to e-mail an article to a friend, we will not use the friend's e-mail address to send additional marketing materials. 

Please note that we may combine the information about you that we collect at this Web Site with information available to us from other sources, including information received from promotional partners or other third parties. We may also combine any PII with other information we collect on our Web Site, including cookies and search terms users enter on our Web Site, which we may use for internal reporting and monitoring, improving our Web Site and products, or to target advertising.

Digital Chicago does not knowingly collect information from children under thirteen (13) years of age: This is not a Web site directed to children under the age of 13, and Digital Chicago does not knowingly collect PII from children under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age, do not send any information about yourself to Digital Chicago. If Digital Chicago discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided Digital Chicago with PII, Digital Chicago will delete that child's PII from its system. 

Anonymous Information: When you visit this Web Site, our Web servers automatically collect certain Web site usage information. Web site usage information is anonymous information that describes how our visitors use and navigate our Web Site, and it includes the number and frequency of visitors to each Web page and the length of their stays. We also collect the anonymous information automatically sent to us by your Web browser, such as browser type, referrer data that identifies the Web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting our Web Site, and IP address. 

Cookies: Like most Web sites, this Web Site sometimes makes use of browser "cookies." Digital Chicago does not save PII in cookies, but we may link the cookie to any PII or other information we collect. In addition, we or our third party advertising networks may use cookies in connection with the serving of advertisements. For example, cookies may be used to control the number of times a user sees a particular advertisement or to target an advertisement to those users that will likely be the most interested in it. We do not have access to cookies set by third parties or the information that they may contain. 

Web Beacons. A Web beacon, which is sometimes also called a Web bug or "clear gif", is a small graphic image in a Web page, a Web-based document or an e-mail message, which generally allows the party that set the Web beacon to monitor certain information about the viewer of the Web page, Web-based document or e-mail message, and it may allow access to certain cookies. Web beacons are usually invisible to the user, because they are very small (generally 1-by-1 pixel). However, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a Web page, including an advertisement, can act as a Web beacon. Web beacons typically collect the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from, the type of browser requesting the Web beacon, the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to and the time the Web beacon was viewed. Web beacons can also be linked to PII. Digital Chicago may use Web beacons for a number of purposes, such as to count visitors to our Web pages or to monitor how our users navigate our site, and we may include Web beacons in HTML-formatted e-mail newsletters in order to count how many newsletters (or particular articles, links, etc.) we sent were actually opened. In addition, third parties that serve ads or content onto this Web Site may use Web beacons. Digital Chicago does not have control over Web beacons used by such third parties and does not have access to whatever information they may collect. 

**Third Party Advertisements and Content**

Third Party Advertisements. We use third party advertising networks to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

When Digital Chicago serves advertisements to you or allows third parties to serve such advertisements on our Web Site, Digital Chicago does not disclose your PII .

Third party content. When you are on our Web Site, certain content may be created or hosted by a third party. Such third parties may drop cookies and/or use Web beacons, which may be used to identify some of your preferences or to recognize you if you have previously been to their Web site or otherwise had contact with them. We do not control the use of such technology by third parties, the information they collect, or how they use such information. We do not disclose your PII to third parties serving content on this Web Site in connection with the serving of such content.
