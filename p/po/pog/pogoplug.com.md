Last revised: October 25, 2009 

Cloud Engines, Inc. (“Cloud Engines”) has created this privacy policy (the "Policy") to explain our privacy practices so you will understand when and how personal information is collected, used, disclosed and protected with respect to our products (“Product”), services ("Service"), and website ("Site") located at http://www.cloudengines.com and http://www.pogoplug.com. By using the Product, Service and the Site, you consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy. 

### SUMMARY

• We collect personal information, such as your name and email address, that you provide to us in connection with Products or Services, as well as aggregate information that does not identify you personally. 

• We do not monitor or collect information regarding any of your content or your files that you access via the Product or Service. 

• We will disclose your personal information only in the limited circumstances described below. • We do not collect any information from children under 13 years of age. 

• We have taken appropriate measures to protect your personal information. 

### WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

We collect two basic types of information with our Product and Service: personal information and aggregate information. 

### Personal information.

When you purchase our Product and register to use the Service, we may collect various kinds of contact information about you including, for example, your name, physical address, and e-mail address. You will also be asked to create a user-chosen ID and password for your use when accessing the Service. We may also collect personal information if you provide it via e-mail, message boards, or other interactive services that are accessible by other users. We do not monitor or collect information regarding your content or your files that you access via the Product or Service. We may collect information that identifies you personally when you send us comments, questions or suggestions. 

### Aggregate information.

Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of services or users from which individual user identities have been removed. In other words, information on how you use our Product and Service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the Product and Service, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data. Aggregate data helps us understand trends in our users' needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Product and Service. 

We automatically receive certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, when you use the Service, our systems may automatically collect your IP address and the type of browser or operating system you use. We use such information, which does not identify individual users, to help manage the effectiveness of our online advertising and to gather access information, such as counting the users who have visited those pages and compiling aggregated statistics about Service usage. We may share aggregate information about our users with third parties for various purposes, including to help us better understand and improve our Product and Service, and for advertising and marketing purposes. 

In addition, we use cookies to collect information so that we can improve our Site by seeing which areas and features are most popular; to personalize the Site and improve the Site experience; and to allow you to visit the Site without re-entering your member ID and/or password. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. You can modify the setting to reject cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit by editing browser options. If you decide not to accept our cookies, you may not be able to use some of the Site's features or services, and you may have a less satisfactory experience. 

### No Information about Children.

Our Product and Service is not intended to be used by children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly, directly or passively, collect information from children under the age of 13. If we create offers and products that make it appropriate to collect information from children under the age of 13, we will notify you of the change in this Policy. 

### HOW DO WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION?

### Internal Use of Personal Information.

All contact information submitted by you is stored in our database and may be archived elsewhere. Access to your personal information will be limited to Cloud Engines employees and contractors who are obligated to protect your information in accordance with this Policy. We use personal information internally to serve our users and enable them to take maximum advantage of our Product and Service. For example, personal information may be used to conduct marketing analysis, to create an individual profile and provide personalized services, to provide services or complete transactions you have requested, to anticipate and resolve problems with our Product and Service, to respond to customer support inquiries, and to create and inform you of new products and services from Cloud Engines that better meet your needs. 

### Disclosure of Personal Information to Others.

• Consent. With your consent, we may disclose your personal information to third parties so that they may provide you with products and services that you have requested. 

• Business Functions. We may share personal information with third-party vendors who assist us in performing internal functions necessary to operate our business or to improve our Products or Services. In the event that we use third-party vendors to assist us in performing these functions, the third parties may not use or disclose your personal information for any other purpose. 

• Business Transfers. Information about our users and the Product and Service is one of our most important business assets. Therefore, information about our users, including personal information, will be disclosed as part of any merger or acquisition, creation of a separate business to provide the Product and Service or fulfill products, sale or pledge of company assets as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company. 

• Protection of Cloud Engines and Others. We may release personal information in the good faith belief that release is appropriate and necessary to comply with legal process or authority (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply our policies; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our rights, property, or personal safety of Cloud Engines, our users, our employees, or the public; or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay. 

### HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

The protection of your personal information is important to Cloud Engines. We use safeguards such as firewalls, password-protected databases with limited physical or electronic access, and encryption. In addition, Cloud Engines may utilize secure technology such as SSL to transfer information provided by users, and additional measures in the processing of sensitive information. While we have taken appropriate measures to guard your personal information, we cannot guarantee that your personal information may be not be disclosed or accessed by the unauthorized acts of others. 

Your account information and access to our Service is accessible only through the use of an individual user ID and password. To protect the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person.
