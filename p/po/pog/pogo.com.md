pogo.com's Privacy Statement  


pogo.com realizes that privacy on the Internet is a great concern to many people. We want to assure our members that pogo.com will not willfully disclose personally identifiable information about a member (for example, name, home address or e-mail address) to any third party without the consent of the member, except in the limited circumstances specifically detailed below. 

This Privacy Statement is intended to clarify (1) why we collect information about our members; (2) what types of information we collect; (3) how we collect that information and (4) what we do with that information once we receive it. This Statement also provides information on how you can "opt out" of certain services offered by pogo.com and its partners and sponsors, including e-mail updates and offers. By using the services provided by pogo.com, you agree, without limitation or qualification, to be bound by this Privacy Statement, as it may be updated from time to time. 

pogo.com reserves the right to change this privacy policy at any time, but our website will state when changes have been made, and in addition, will state the date it was last updated. We encourage you to review our privacy policy whenever you use this website to make sure you understand how your information will be used. 

Why does pogo.com collect information about its members?  


We collect information about our members in order to understand who plays our games so that we can improve our service, customize the user experience and provide advertising and sponsorships that are more likely to be of interest to you. Our ability to present more relevant and interesting advertising also helps improve your experience on pogo.com. We collect information from our users and provide it in an aggregated form to our advertisers and partners so that they can better understand our base of members and create better offerings for you. We do not share individual personally identifiable information with advertisers or partners without the member's consent. Because we derive most of our revenue from advertising and sponsorships, collecting and analyzing user data is crucial to our ability to keep our games free to members. 

What types of information does pogo.com collect?  


When you register or claim prizes on pogo.com, we generally collect two types of information from you: general demographic data (for example, year of birth, gender, ZIP code and country) and personally identifiable information (for example, your e-mail address, name and home address). Whenever we collect personally identifiable information, we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Statement on that page. We do not share any member's personally identifiable information with third parties without the member's consent. 

We also offer members the ability to register for other related services from our site (for example, MyPoints). If you opt in to any of these services, we may collect additional information requested by a service provider and pass this information, together with all other registration information (including personally identifiable information), to that service provider. Use of your information by a service provider will be governed by the terms of service (including the privacy statement) of that service provider. Pogo may also retain any additional information collected for use in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Statement. Participation in these other related services is optional and is not required to play games on pogo.com. 

We also conduct surveys of our members from time to time to better understand our community and provide better service to our members. Participation in user surveys is always voluntary, and no personally identifiable information collected from these surveys is disclosed to third parties without the member's consent. 

In addition, when a member spends time on the pogo.com site, we and our partners may also collect information about the member's use of the pogo.com site, including games played, time spent playing our games and which ads or links are clicked. In addition, DoubleClick, the company that serves many of the ads that appear on the pogo.com site, may also collect information regarding your activities online, including the sites you visit. Other ad serving companies may also collect similar information. For more information on DoubleClick's services and how you can opt out of those services, please visit [DoubleClick's website](http://www.doubleclick.com:8080/privacy_policy/) For more information about the practices of some of the other large ad serving companies that may collect information on your use of the site, you may visit [AdKnowledge](http://www.adknowledge.com/privacy/index.html), [Avenue A](http://www.avenuea.com/info/privacy.asp) and [MediaPlex](http://www.mediaplex.com/mp/privacy/privacy_f.html) to view their privacy statements and opt out policies. 

We and the ad serving companies may also collect information about the type of browsers our members use, the IP address of people who access our site, and the URL or the website from which a member comes to the pogo.com site. 

How does pogo.com collect this information?  


**Registration process**  
The pogo.com registration form requires a new member to provide a "screen name" (a "handle" or moniker by which he or she will be known on our service) and contact information in the form of an e-mail address. We also require a new user to enter general demographic information, including ZIP code, year and month of birth, gender, and country. 

During the registration process, you have the option to choose to receive our promotional e-mail and those of selected partners we do business with. You can, at any time, choose to unsubscribe from these e-mail lists by following the instructions contained in the e-mails. 

**Member surveys**  
We occasionally run marketing surveys on our site. These surveys are used to fully understand our audience, to provide better service, as a factor in determining new features and games to add to our service and to collect more specific aggregate demographic information. Participation in these surveys is always optional. 

Data collected from member surveys are used by our marketing department and occasionally shared in aggregate form with our advertisers and sponsors. We may also use a member's survey data to direct advertising that is more likely to be of interest to the member. No member's personally identifiable information is disclosed to a third party as part of our member surveys without the member's consent. 

**Prizes and verification information**  
Some of pogo.com's games reward successful players with prizes that can take the form of cash or other prizes. Only certain residents of the United States and Canada (excluding Quebec) who are 18 years of age or more are eligible to receive prizes, and all prize programs are void where prohibited by law. See the [Prize Rules](https://web.archive.org/web/20001207071000id_/http%3A//www.pogo.com/corporate/prizerules.html) for complete details. 

In order to award cash and other prizes, we must collect specific personally identifiable information for income tax purposes. This specific information includes: full legal name, complete address (city, state, country and zip/postal code), a social security number (social insurance number in Canada) and date of birth. All information must be completed in full as described in our Affidavit of Eligibility and must be accurate in order to receive a prize. If this information is not collected and verified, the prize will not be awarded. 

If you win a prize, pogo.com reserves the right to use your name, city and state and other information (excluding your social security number) in advertising, promotional and/or marketing materials as described in the Liability and Publicity Release on our web-based prize claim form. 

Participation in games with a prize component is strictly voluntary and is not a required part of our service. We only request personally identifiable information on the prize claim form and Affidavit of Eligibility if a member has voluntarily chosen to play our prize-based games. Any member may play prize-based games, but in order to collect any prize associated with those games, the member must provide the information requested. Alternatively, the member may elect not to play those games or may decline any prizes awarded in those games. 

**website usage data**  
We use "cookies" (see definition below) and other methods to monitor our website usage. This traffic data is collected as you use our service and is used primarily by our marketing group. We collect information on what games are played, how much time is spent playing the games and which ads or links are clicked. We also share this aggregate data with third parties. No personally identifiable information is collected or shared with third parties through cookies. 

DoubleClick, the company that serves the ads that appear on the pogo.com site, may also collect information regarding your activities on pogo.com, including the ads you click on and the other sites you visit. For more information on DoubleClick's services and how you can opt out of those services, please visit [DoubleClick's website](http://www.doubleclick.com:8080/privacy_policy/). 

How do we use the information we collect?  


**How we may use and disclose aggregate demographic information**  
The aggregate demographic information we collect from our members is shared with our advertisers, partners and sponsors to help them understand the types of people who play our games. This information helps us to sell advertisements and promotions and helps keep our games available to you for free. 

**How we may use and disclose non-personally identifiable information**  
During the registration process, each member is asked to provide his or her year of birth, gender, ZIP code and country. In marketing surveys, we may request additional information, including household income, education level, type of employment, hobbies and other types of information. This information may be used by pogo.com to select and direct advertising that is more likely to be of interest to a particular member. This information is transmitted to an ad server owned by DoubleClick to match members with ads that they are more likely to be interested in. We do not disclose any member's personally identifiable information to our advertisers without the member's consent. Participation in member surveys is entirely optional. 

In addition, DoubleClick may use information regarding your activities on pogo.com and other web sites (including search terms, ads you click on and sites you visit online) to create more detailed user profiles. These profiles are not associated with any personally identifiable information, but are used by DoubleClick and its partners (including pogo.com) to understand members and to direct advertising that is more relevant to you. For more information on DoubleClick's services and how you can opt out of those services, please visit [DoubleClick's website](http://www.doubleclick.com:8080/privacy_policy/). 

**How we may use and disclose personally identifiable information:**  
**A:** _E-mail promotions and offers from pogo.com and our partners._ During the registration process, you may choose to receive promotional e-mail from pogo.com and selected partners we do business with. If you do not opt out of the pogo.com e-mail information, or if you opt in to the other promotions and offers, we will use your e-mail address to send you the pogo.com newsletter and updates and to send you information on products or services from our selected partners and sponsors. You can, at any time, choose to unsubscribe from these e-mail lists by following the instructions contained in the e-mails. We also offer members the ability to register for other related services from our site (for example, MyPoints). If you opt in to any of these services, we may collect additional information requested by a service provider and pass this information, together with all other registration information (including personally identifiable information), to that service provider. Use of your information by a service provider will be governed by the terms of service (including the privacy statement) of that service provider. We may also retain any additional information collected for use in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Statement. Participation in these other related services is optional and is not required to play games on pogo.com. 

**B:** _Prize distribution and promotion._ The payment of prizes requires that pogo.com collect specific personally identifiable information for income tax and other purposes. This information includes: full legal name, complete address (city, state, country and zip/postal code), a social security number (social insurance number in Canada) and date of birth. In order to claim a prize, a winning player must provide all information requested in the Affidavit of Eligibility. If a player does not provide complete and accurate information, or if pogo.com is unable to verify the accuracy of the information, pogo.com will not award the prize to the player. 

If a player wins a prize, pogo.com reserves the right to use the player's personal information, including a player's name, city, state and other information (excluding social security number) in advertising, promotional and/or marketing materials as described in the Liability and Publicity Release on our secure web-based prize claim form. Games with prizes are not a required part of the pogo.com service. Thus, the personally identifiable information provided to us through our prize claim form is the result of a voluntary choice to play the prize-based games. Any member may play prize-based games, but in order to collect any prize associated with those games, the member must provide the information requested. Alternatively, the member may elect not to play those games or may decline any prizes awarded in those games. 

**C:** _Legal process and protection of pogo.com and our members._ In certain cases, we may disclose your personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that the disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference to pogo.com's rights, property, operations or users or to others who may be harmed by such activities. We may also disclose your personally identifiable information if we believe that the law requires disclosure or in response to a demand by law enforcement authorities in connection with a criminal investigation or by civil or administrative authorities in connection with a pending civil case or administrative action. 

**Website usage data**  
We use "cookies" (see definition below) and other methods to monitor our website usage. This data is collected in an aggregate form and used by our marketing team in the following ways: to determine high-traffic areas of our site, to locate areas of improvement to our service, to judge how well certain games are received, to select additional, similar games for our service and in other marketing-related tasks. We also collect information on the amount of time spent by users (or "stickiness") on certain web pages and our site in general and share this data with third parties. No personally identifiable information is collected or shared with third parties through cookies. We also use the data collected through cookies to determine which ads are more likely to be of interest to a member and to direct those ads accordingly. 

**Feedback and bug reporting information**  
Members have the option to provide us with web-based feedback and also to report bugs (defects) in our games. Both the feedback and bug reporting sections ask for the user's screen name and an e-mail address. The feedback and bug reports are read by a subset of pogo.com's employees, including, but not limited to, our Customer Service department. Important feedback/bug reports are forwarded to the appropriate department in our company (engineering, marketing, etc.). The e-mail address of the member may be used in case we need further information about a reported bug or for other feedback-related purposes, and will not be distributed to any third parties. Any personal information included in the feedback and bug reports is not recorded or saved in our database. 

**Miscellaneous information gathered and/or tracked**  
In addition to the above-listed data that we collect or track, we also display some non-personally identifiable data. These items consist of player rating information (your skill level and ranking on a particular game), any prize winnings, and player game statistics (number of games played, wins and losses, etc.). In the cases stated in the previous sentence, only a player's screen name (his or her chosen "handle") will be displayed, and no personally identifiable information will be shown. 

How does pogo.com protect children's privacy?  


pogo.com is not directed at children under the age of 13. In order to comply with the [Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998](http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1999/9910/childfinal.htm), pogo.com will not accept registrations from users who are 12 and under. Users who are currently 13 years of age or older may register normally. 

After April 20, 2000, pogo.com will not knowingly collect any information, including demographic data or other personally identifiable data, from users aged 12 and under. If a child under 13 sends feedback or e-mail to pogo.com, the contact information will be used only to respond to the specific question or request. pogo.com does not knowingly distribute any information or data collected from children under 13 to any third parties. pogo.com does not knowingly allow children under 13 to publicly post or distribute any personally identifiable information to others on the pogo.com site. 

If parents have any questions about our policy with respect to children's privacy on our site, you can contact us at [customersupport@pogo.com](mailto:customersupport@pogo.com). 

What are "cookies" and how are they used?  


This site uses small data files called "cookies" that are created and then stored on a user's hard drive. These cookie files can contain information such as screen names and passwords, demographic information as well as tracking data. These cookies only contain information that you provide in some manner. Our cookies cannot read any information, personal or otherwise, from your hard drive and cannot read cookies created by other websites. 

**Accepting cookies**  
You should have your web browser set up to accept cookies, or you may be unable to play games on our system. A browser's initial configuration is to allow cookies, but if you've adjusted your browser settings to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive a warning message each time we send (or check) a cookie to your computer. 

**Why do we use cookies on our site?**  
We use cookies on our pages for a variety of purposes. In some cases, our cookies store your screen and password so that you don't have to sign on to our service again (as long as you're using the same computer) since cookies are stored on your computer, not ours. We also use them to track the number of page views and the "stickiness" on those pages. In addition, we store our system's "preference" information in cookies (saving such things as screen size, "friends lists" and other non-personally identifiable information). We encrypt these cookies for added security. 

**Advertisers and their cookies**  
Our sponsors and advertisers may use cookies within their advertisements or promotions that could potentially collect information about you or your web usage. pogo.com does not control this flow of information and it may be difficult to discern which cookies are coming from our site and which are coming from our advertisers. We try to ensure that our advertisers and sponsors adhere to our privacy practices, but if you have any concerns about the information they may be gathering, it's best if you contact those advertisers directly. 

DoubleClick and other companies may serve the ads that appear on the pogo.com network of sites. These companies may also place cookies on a member's hard drive in order to target ads to that member or to collect other information about a member's online activities, including other sites visited. For more information about DoubleClick's privacy policy, and for information on opting out of DoubleClick's services, please visit [DoubleClick's website](http://www.doubleclick.com:8080/privacy_policy/). For more information about the practices of some of the other large ad serving companies that may collect information on your use of the site, you may visit [AdKnowledge](http://www.adknowledge.com/privacy/index.html), [Avenue A](http://www.avenuea.com/info/privacy.asp) and [MediaPlex](http://www.mediaplex.com/mp/privacy/privacy_f.html) to view their privacy statements and opt out policies. 

What happens to information disclosed in public chat rooms?  


As part of pogo.com's gaming service, we provide areas where players can engage in public chat. Members using these chat rooms are identified solely by their user-created screen names. Please remember that any information you disclose within these forums becomes public knowledge. Use of the chat rooms is strictly voluntary, and members should never disclose any personal information in these areas. pogo.com is not responsible for any information you choose to disclose. 

What is the opt-out policy for pogo.com?  


During the registration process, each member is asked to provide his or her year of birth, gender, ZIP code and country, as well as a valid e-mail address. This information is required in order to play most of the games on our site. We do not monitor the validity of the information you provide unless you become entitled to a prize, in which case we require a valid e-mail address, mailing address and tax identification number for prize confirmation and fulfillment. A member who does not wish to disclose this additional information may still play our games, but will not be eligible to receive prizes. 

Members have the ability to opt out of receiving e-mail updates, newsletters and other information from pogo.com, as well as direct mail offers from selected partners and sponsors. This is done at the point of initial registration to play games on our site. All of our newsletters and direct e-mail communications have easy-to-follow unsubscribe instructions at the bottom. Members who do not provide a valid e-mail address and other information will be ineligible to claim or collect prizes from our games and contests. A member can change his or her e-mail address after registration. 

Members may also opt out of participation in the DoubleClick service, which collects information regarding your activities on pogo.com, including the ads you click on and the other sites you visit. For more information on DoubleClick's services and how you can opt out of those services, please visit [DoubleClick's website.](http://www.doubleclick.com:8080/privacy_policy/). 

Because our site is supported by advertising, our members cannot opt out of having ads displayed on the pages of our site. 

If you have questions about our opt-out policy, you can contact us at [customersupport@pogo.com](mailto:customersupport@pogo.com). 

How can a member change his or her information?  


**Updating your information**  
We provide the ability to change certain aspects of your user profile and preference settings. Specifically, we give the user the chance (after registration) to change their e-mail address, screen size preference, "friends lists" and other preference data stored on our computers or through cookies on your computer. 

If you have questions about how to correct or update your user information, or if you want to adjust demographic information not mentioned above, please contact us at [customersupport@pogo.com](mailto:customersupport@pogo.com). 

**Cancelling your account**  
Currently, there is no way to cancel your account with us. However, there is no penalty for leaving your account dormant, since we will not delete it automatically. 

You can, however, remove yourself from our electronic-based newsletters by following the unsubscribe information contained in our newsletters. 

If you are unable to change certain aspects of your user information, or want further clarification on how to remove yourself from our newsletter mailing list, please contact us at [customersupport@pogo.com](mailto:customersupport@pogo.com).
