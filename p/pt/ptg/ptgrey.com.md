# Point Grey Research Inc. - Privacy Policy

Point Grey Research is committed to protecting your privacy and keeping your personal information secure. You can visit most pages on our web site without providing any information about yourself, but sometimes we need to collect personal information to deliver the services you request, such as registering for a Point Grey event, or to receive an electronic newsletter or product information.

Personal Information

Personal information identifies a specific individual and includes content such as your name, address, phone and fax number and email address. In carrying out business, Point Grey is trusted with personal information about its customers. We respect the private nature of this information and will limit its collection, use and disclosure to the appropriate purpose for which it was collected. We also collect anonymous web site visitation data that allows us to help ensure our site is relevant to your needs and contains information of value to you.

We may occasionally send e-mails advising you of technical service or maintenance issues related to a product or service you purchased. These emails are considered essential support for our products and cannot be unsubscribed to. We may also occasionally send emails to alert you to product upgrades, supporting and new products and services, special offers, and updated information. You have the option of opting-out of these alerts at any time.

Personal Information Related to Children

Point Grey Research does not intend to collect personal information from children who identify themselves as minors under 18 years of age. Children should not provide personal information on the Point Grey web site. If they wish to receive information from Point Grey, we ask that their parent submit a request their behalf.

Terms of Use

When you give us personal information, Point Grey Research will not share that information with third parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions already listed above. Your personal information will only be used for the purposes stated upon collection.

We occasionally contract other companies to provide specific services on our behalf, including sending mail and processing event registration. We will give those service providers only the information they need to deliver the service agreed upon, and they are prohibited from using the provided information for any other purpose.

Your information may be stored and processed in Canada, the United States or any other country in which Point Grey Research maintains offices, and by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. By using this site, you also understand and agree that the information collected can be stored indefinitely.

Point Grey Research may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Point Grey Research or our website; or (b) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our employees, users of our products or services, or members of the public.
