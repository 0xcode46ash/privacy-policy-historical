# Privacy Policy

## Privacy

APTA and PTCAS have developed policies to prevent the exposure of personally identifiable information as set forth herein to limit the distribution of sensitive data to those situations which require it, and to permit distribution of non-sensitive, directory information wherever a useful purpose can be served. Data submitted by or on behalf of an applicant is used for the PTCAS application process in communications with the PT program, as part of the application and for record keeping, and for research and statistical purposes. PTCAS protects the information provided. If information is provided to third parties for educational research purposes, it does not contain any of the following personally identifiable information about the applicants or parents, other family or household members of the applicant in the application file:

  * name;
  * address; 
  * a personal identifier such as the person's social security number, student number or biometric record; 
  * other indirect identifiers, such as the person's date of birth, place of birth, and mother's maiden name; and
  * other information that, alone or in combination, is linked or linkable to a specific person that would allow a reasonable person who does not have personal knowledge of the relevant circumstances, to identify the person with reasonable certainty



Researchers must agree not to publish any particular category or data set if the number of individuals in the category or data set is twenty-five (25) or less.

Information about applicants and students is, of course, disclosed to the physical therapist programs to which an applicant applies and/or matriculates. With the exception of monitoring reports related to multiple acceptances, information submitted to PTCAS by a PT program is available only to that institution.

PTCAS will make every attempt to protect any personal information submitted to it via email. However, email is not secure against interception. Any sensitive information emailed to PTCAS is provided at the risk of the sender. If you are concerned that the content of your communication is especially sensitive, you should consider contacting PTCAS by phone or sending the information by postal mail instead.

This privacy policy is subject to change and applies only to information on the PTCAS website, and not to other APTA websites or outside sites linked to by APTA's websites. By using the PTCAS website, you signify your agreement to the terms of the privacy policy.

## Security

Security is a priority at PTCAS. We are committed to protecting the security and confidentiality of your information. We use a combination of state-of-the-art technology and methods to help ensure that your online sessions are secure.

Any personal information you send us is scrambled. This technology, called Secure Socket Layers (SSL), protects information you submit or receive through this site. In addition, any sensitive personal information that you send to our web site (such as social security number) is held in a secured environment, protected by tools such as firewalls and/or database field encryption. The technology is designed to make using your personal data and credit card information on the Internet as safe as possible. PTCAS protects the privacy of your credit card information, name, address, e-mail and all other information you provide us via the on-line payment process. No representation is made, however, regarding the unconditional security of such submissions.

Independent agencies report there are no recorded instances of someone "breaking" SSL encryption and using credit card information for fraudulent purposes. Statistically speaking, it is safer to submit your credit card information electronically via an SSL site than it is to give your card to a store clerk. SSL technology is so safe that VeriSign, the PTCAS certifying authority, warrants it against fraudulent use for up to $100,000.

The SSL technology depends on secure Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) that are certified by an authority such as VeriSign. Secure URLs always begin with "https://" (not "http://"). If you use a browser that recognizes SSL, you will be notified that you are on a secure page. Any information you enter on such a page is encrypted, sent over the Internet in encrypted form, and de-encrypted at our server. If your browser doesn't support SSL technology, you will receive an error message when trying to access our SSL page. If this error occurs, logout of your application and download the most current Internet Explorer browser.

Once we receive your credit card information, it is accessible only to designated PTCAS administrators.
