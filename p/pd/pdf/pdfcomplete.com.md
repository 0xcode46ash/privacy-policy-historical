The following statement discloses PDF Complete’s consumer privacy practices for the PDF Complete Web Site (“Site”). We do update our policy from time to time without notice so please check back periodically. All updates will be published at this Site.  
  
Personal Information

PDF Complete understands your desire to protect personal information. We intend to inform you how your personal information will be gathered, tracked or used, and to give you choices. If choices are not offered on web pages where your personal information is obtained, please select one of the communication channels at the bottom of this statement to indicate your communication preferences.

Information we gather and track

We request personal information when you place an order, register a product, request a service, answer a survey, enter a contest, correspond with us or engage in certain other activities on our website. For example: If you submit an order on-line with us, we will ask you for information necessary to complete the transaction - such as your name, address, and credit card number. If you request technical support online, we will ask you for information necessary to complete the transaction — such as your name address and information about your computer hardware, software and the nature of the problem you are experiencing. You make the decision whether to proceed with any activity that requests personal information. If you do not wish to provide the requested information, however, you may not be able to complete the transaction.

How we use the information we gather and track

We use personally identifiable information in the following ways:

  * To provide you with information about product upgrades, new products, services, newsletters, informative emails, and research on future product ideas or improvements; 
  * To assist us in creating content that is relevant to you; 
  * To provide you with special offers that may be of interest to you; 
  * To assist us in creating better products and services to meet your needs; 
  * To allow you to purchase and download products, obtain access to services or otherwise engage in activities you select; 
  * To help you quickly find software, services or product information important to you

With whom we may share your information

From time to time, we may provide your information to selected business partners to communicate to you information about products or services that they believe are important to you or your business. If you prefer that we not provide your information to our business partners, you may let us know using one of the methods described in this policy. In addition, PDF Complete retains the services of outside contractors to provide services for us. They may be used to ship products, provide technical support, or handle order processing. We require that these contractors keep the personal information of customers secure and confidential. We also require that these contractors use personal information only on behalf of PDF Complete. In certain instances, it may be necessary for PDF Complete to disclose your personal information to government officials or otherwise as required by our legal obligations.

Opt-out of providing certain information

PDF Complete provides a number of ways for you to ‘opt-out’ of receiving additional information from us or having us provide your personal information to our partners. We may offer you these choices at the time you give us your information. If you are on a PDF Complete web page that requires personal information but does not offer communication choices, or would like to change your preferences for information that you have previously provided, please use one of the communication channels at the bottom of this statement. If you are registering a version of a product that does not provide you the capability to indicate your communication preferences, please use one of the communication channels at the bottom of this statement. If you do not wish to continue receiving our e-mail newsletters or bulletins you can opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to the unsubscribe in the subject line in the email.

Children’s privacy

PDF Complete is committed to protecting the privacy needs of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s online activities and interests. PDF Complete does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 and PDF Complete does not target its websites to children under 13.  
  
  
Security

We have taken security measures, consistent with international information practices, to protect your personal information. These measures include technical and procedural steps to protect your data from misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, loss, alteration, or destruction. Credit card information is transmitted using secure socket layer (SSL) encryption.

Since PDF Complete is a global company, we provide company information to our worldwide offices. The personal information that you have provided to us may be transferred to other PDF Complete offices around the world. For example, when Australian customers register PDF Complete products their personal information may be transferred to servers in Bermuda then transferred to servers in one or more of PDF Complete’s Australian offices. Also, in certain countries our outside contractors might undertake the collection, transferring, storage and processing of your information.

We make a sincere effort to respond to your requests to update or correct your personal information. If you believe that PDF Complete does not have your current personal information, you can update it by using one of the communication channels at the bottom of this statement.
