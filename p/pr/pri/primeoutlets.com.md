# Privacy Policy | Prime Outlets

At Prime Retail, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner.

As part of the normal operation of our services, we collect and, in some cases, disclose information about you. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect about you and what may happen to that information.

### Information We Collect

In order to use certain services provided on the site or to participate in sweepstakes or similar promotional programs, you will need to register with us. When you register, we will gather such information as your name, mailing address and e-mail address, and demographic information, such as zip code, age or income level. We may also track certain information about how you use our website. In the course of using our site, we automatically track certain information about you. This information may include the URL linking to our site (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you go to next (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address.

Except as provided below, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children 18 years old or younger. Prime Retail does not intentionally market our website to individuals under the age of 18. We require that all visitors who wish to register for promotions, sweepstakes, giveaways, etc. on our website attest that they are 18 years of age or older.

### Purpose of Use

Any personal information collected or supplied to us may be used to conduct internal research on our user’s demographics, interests and site usage, to better understand and service you.

Additionally, we may share personal information with businesses affiliated with Prime Retail. They may use this information as we would, and you may occasionally receive product and service information from them. We may also use your information to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests. In the future, we may make our e-mail address list available to carefully screened companies whose products may be of interest to you. If you wish to unsubscribe you may do so by filling out the unsubscribe form or by going to the Contact Us page and sending an e-mail.

Finally, if you opt in, we may share user information with outside vendors and organizations that provide support services to us or that help us with our marketing programs. We will not use personal information for any purpose other than the purposes mentioned above.

### Protecting Your Information

We use industry-standard technology and efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information. These include secure servers and firewalls. All of the user data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. Only authorized employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to this information.

### What Are “Cookies?”

A “cookie” is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive, containing information about the user. We use cookies on our site, but none of them contain any personally identifiable information. In addition, we may decide to use cookies on certain pages of our site. Cookies can help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our site. Most cookies are “session cookies,” meaning that they are automatically deleted at the end of a session.

Some of our business partners also use cookies on our site. We have no control over these cookies, and we may not have access to the information these advertisers collect. You may choose not to accept cookies by setting your browser to refuse all cookies or to notify you each time a cookie is set. If you choose to refuse cookies, however, you may not be able to use all features of our site.

### Links to Third-Party Websites

Our site sometimes provides links to websites that are operated solely by third parties that are not under our control. This Privacy Statement applies to our site only, and is not intended to describe the privacy policies of any third-party sites.
