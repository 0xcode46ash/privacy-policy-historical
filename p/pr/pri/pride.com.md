**1\. What information does Gay.com gather/track about you?**

Our site's registration form requires members to give us contact information (such as name and email address) and demographic information (such as zip code, age, or income level). We use member contact information from the registration form to send our members information about our services. The member's contact information is also used to contact the member when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data for other purposes. We use this data to tailor the member's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. 

Our site uses cookies to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your member name and password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, and for other purposes. 

We also log IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. We do not link IP addresses to personal information. 

This site contains links to other sites. Gay.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

From time to time, we run contests on our site in which we ask members and visitors for contact information (such as email addresses) and demographic information (such as zip code, age, or income level). The visitor's contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.
