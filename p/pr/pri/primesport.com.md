  6.0 Non-Affiliations

**

PrimeSport International is an independent, privately owned company engaged in the business of buying and selling tickets at a premium for sporting events, concerts, and theatre. The amount charged over the face value of the tickets represents our fair compensation for the difficulty involved in obtaining premium seating to hard-to-get and sold-out events. 

PrimeSport International is in **no way affiliated** with any box office or official organizers (e.g. FIFA, ATP, NBA, NCAA, etc) of the events for which we obtain tickets.
