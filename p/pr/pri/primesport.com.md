Depending on your use of the website or other services, we may make available from time to time various websites (together with associated and successor websites and services, the "Site"), through which we may collect two types of information: personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information. 

_Personally Identifiable Information_

: Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you. Such information may include your name, address, email address, telephone number and birth date (primarily for eligibility purposes). 

_Non-Personally Identifiable Information_

: Non-personally identifiable information is information that by itself cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information (e.g., age, profession or gender). Non-personally identifiable information may also include user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of the Site. 

We will collect personally identifiable information from you only if you voluntarily submit the information to us. We may also receive personally identifiable information about you from third parties providing credit and debit card authorization and fraud screening services as part of your use of the Site. 

_Registering to Use the Site and in the Course of Using the Site:_

You may be required to establish an account on the Site in order to take advantage of certain features of the Site. If so, to establish an account you may be required to provide us with information (including personally identifiable information) such as name, postal address, email address and credit card and billing information. We may also receive personally identifiable information about you from third parties providing credit and debit card authorization and fraud screening services as part of the registration process. In addition, we may obtain your personally identifiable information from you if you identify yourself to us by sending us an email with questions or comments. 

_Cookies, Log Files and Action Tags_

: We collect non-personally identifiable information passively using cookies," log files" and action tags." 

"Cookies" are small text files that are placed on your computer in order to identify your Web browser and the activities of your computer on the Site and other websites. Cookies are used to personalize your experience on the Site (such as dynamically generating content on web pages specifically designed for you), to assist you in using the Site (such as saving time by not having to reenter your name upon each visit to the Site), and to allow us to statistically monitor how you are using the Site to help us improve our online offerings. We also may use cookies to target certain advertisements to your browser which may be of interest to you or to determine the popularity of certain content. 

In addition to cookies that we place on your computer, cookies may also be placed on your computer by third parties that we use to display or serve advertisements on the Site or to collect non-personally identifiable information in order to provide advertising-related services. In the course of serving advertisements on this website, our third-party advertisers may place or recognize unique cookies on your browser. 

You do not have to accept cookies to use the Site. Although most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, you may reset your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to reject cookies generally. Most browsers offer instructions on how to do so in the "Help" section of the toolbar. While you are not required to accept our cookies to access the Site, if you reject cookies, certain products, offerings, features, or resources of the Site may not work properly and you may experience some loss of convenience. 

We also collect non-personally identifiable information through our Internet log files, which record data such as user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of the Site. This information may be used to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to monitor the use of the Site, and to gather general demographic information. We may link this information to personally identifiable information for these and other purposes such as personalizing your experience on the Site and evaluating the Site in general. 

"Action tags," also known as web beacons or gif tags, are a web technology used to help track website usage information, such as how many times a specific page has been viewed. Action tags are invisible to you, and any portion of the Site, including advertisements, or email sent on our behalf, may contain action tags. 

By using cookies and action tags together, we are able to gain valuable information to improve the Site and measure the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns. We do not disclose any of your personally identifiable information to our advertising partners. 

Finally, you should be aware that advertisers and other third parties may also use their own cookies, log files or action tags when you click on their advertisement or link to their websites or services on or from the Site. This Privacy Policy does not govern the use by such third-party websites or services or providers of third-party advertising. 

We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. The Site is not designed for or directed to children under the age of 13. We do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we actually know is under the age of 13. 

In general, we use the information collected on the Site to provide the Site to you and process your transactions, to help us understand who uses the Site, to improve the Site, and to contact you for customer service and billing purposes. 

We may use your information to send you a welcoming email to confirm your user name and password. If you â€œopt-in," we may send you electronic newsletters, contact you about the Site products, services, information and news that may be of interest to you, and provide you with targeted feedback. If you no longer desire to receive these communications, we will provide you with the option to change your preferences. In addition, if you identify yourself to us by sending us an email with questions or comments, we may use your information (including personally identifiable information) to respond to your questions or comments, and we may file your questions or comments for future reference. We may also use the information collected to send you important service announcements and updates regarding the Site or, if applicable, about your billing account status. You can choose to not receive these communications by changing your personal preferences or by contacting us at [customerservice@primesport.com.](mailto://customerservice@primesport.com)

We may also use the information gathered on the Site to perform statistical analysis of user behavior or to evaluate and improve the Site. We may link some of this information to personally identifiable information for internal purposes only or to improve your experience with the Site. 

Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy or as specifically authorized by you, we will not disclose any information we gather from you on the Site. 

Laws and Legal Rights: We may disclose your information (including personally identifiable information) if we believe we are required to do so to comply with an applicable statute, regulation, rule or law, a subpoena, a search warrant, a court or regulatory order, or other valid legal process. We may disclose personally identifiable information in special circumstances when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating any Official Rules for our Site, or to protect the safety and/or security of our users, the Site or the general public. 

Third Parties Generally: We may provide third parties with information about you that does not allow you to be identified or contacted, including where such information is combined with similar information of other users of the Site. For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit the Site, the demographic breakdown of our registered users of the Site, or the products and/or services purchased using the Site and the vendors of such products and services. The third parties to which we may provide this information may include potential or actual advertisers, providers of advertising products or services (including vendors and website tracking services), merchants, affiliates and other actual or potential commercial partners, sponsors, licensees, researchers and other similar parties. 

Outside Contractors: We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers (collectively, "Outside Contractors") to provide specific services and products related to the Site, such as hosting and maintaining the Site, providing credit card processing and fraud screening, and developing applications for the Site and e-mail services. In the course of providing products or services to us, these Outside Contractors may sometimes have limited access to information collected on the Site, including your personally identifiable information. We require that these contractors (1) protect the privacy of your personally identifiable information consistent with this Privacy Policy, and (2) not use or disclose your personally identifiable information for any purpose other than providing us with the products or services for which we contracted. 

Third Party Sellers: In addition, through the Site, you may be given the opportunity to purchase (or to obtain more information regarding) certain content, products or services that are sold by parties other than us (collectively, "Merchants"). Merchants may request that you submit certain information to them in order to purchase their products or services or to obtain additional information from them. By submitting the requested information, you affirmatively consent to have that information shared with the Merchant. This information is used by the Merchant and may be subject to a different privacy policy. We encourage you to be aware when the Site links to Merchants websites and to read the privacy policies or statements of each and every Merchant website. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by the Site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of Merchants and have no control over any information you choose to provide them or how they use it. 

Sale of Business: We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of PrimeSport, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

Affiliates: We may disclose information (including personally identifiable information) about you to our Corporate Affiliates. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Corporate Affiliate" means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with PrimeSport, Inc., whether by ownership or otherwise. Any information relating to you that we provide to our Corporate Affiliates will be treated by those Corporate Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

Our website may contain links to other websites not owned or operated by us (for example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, you will likely be taken off the Site). However, please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third party websites. We encourage you to be aware when the Site links to other websites and to read the privacy policies or statements of each and every website. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by the Site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties and have no control over any information you choose to provide them or how they use it. 

We want your information (including personally identifiable information) to remain as secure as possible. Therefore, the Site has implemented reasonable security measures in an effort to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of the information under our control. We use reasonable networking, server, database, and procedural mechanisms in an effort to safeguard the integrity and privacy of data. In addition, when you enter sensitive information into our forms (such as credit card numbers) we encrypt it using 128-bit secure socket layer technology (SSL). However, no method of Internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure. There is also some risk that others could find a way to thwart our security systems. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

We also protect user information off-line. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted passwords to access personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Periodically, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage. 

We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users and visitors and we will continue to review and implement new technologies as necessary to maintain the security of our networks and servers. 

Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will only use personally identifiable information for the purposes described above or as otherwise disclosed at the time we request such information from you. You must "opt-in" and give us permission to use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. For example, we may have an "opt-in" mechanism so that those who become registered users of the Site must give us permission to send them marketing materials and our electronic newsletter. 

You have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally identifiable information as follows. You can contact us in order to (1) update or correct your personally identifiable information, (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or (3) delete the personally identifiable information maintained about you on our systems (subject to the following paragraph). Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will not have an effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third-parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion. 

To contact us in order to update, correct, opt-out of communication, or have your data erased please contact us at privacypolicy@primesport.com

You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove every record of the information you provided from our system. The need to back-up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your personally identifiable information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. However, after receiving your request, all personally identifiable information stored in databases we actively use and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably practicable. 

You should be aware that we may revise this Privacy Policy at any time and that such revisions may result in additional uses or disclosures of your personally identifiable information. If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will notify you of any material changes to these Terms of Use by posting a notice on the homepage of the Site for a reasonable period of time after such changes are made, and by changing the "Last Updated" date at the top of the Privacy Policy. We may also make non-significant changes to this Privacy Policy that generally will not affect our use of your personally identifiable information. We encourage you to check this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the Site following the notification or posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will mean you accept those changes. 

This privacy policy does not cover how any third parties with whom we may be working deal with information that they may collect from you. Use of that information by such third parties will be governed, if at all, by their own privacy policy. For example, in connection with any co-branded promotions with third parties, we do not control and are not responsible for the use the other party may make of information that they may collect from you. 

If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or feel that we are not abiding by the terms of this Privacy Policy, please contact our Privacy Agent in any of the following ways:
