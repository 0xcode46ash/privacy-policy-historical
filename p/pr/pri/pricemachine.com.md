**Information Collection and Use**

Factory Clearance Center is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.

**Payment Method**  
We accept all major credit cards including, Visa, MasterCard, Amex, Discover and Diners Club. There is no surcharge for using your credit card when making purchases. For the customer's protection, all information on the order sheet, including credit card holders name, number, billing address, is subject to verification prior to processing any order. This is to prevent fraud, and the unlikely use of the credit card without the cardholder's permission.

  
**Warranty Information  
**  
All consumer electronic products are factory refurbished unless otherwise specified and carry manufacturer's warranty from thirty days to one year. Should you experience any problem with the item purchase, contact the manufacturer at once.
