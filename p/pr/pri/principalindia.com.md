Secure Server Software   
  
To ensure the security of your confidential account information, we use proven security software to encrypt the information before it is transmitted through the Internet. We only allow confidential information to be submitted for transmission if your browser is compatible with SSL, our security software. If your browser is not compatible, you will receive a message indicating your transaction can not be completed because of the security risk. 

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) establishes a secure connection between two parties (for example, your browser and our web server). It is used to implement HTTPS, the secure version of HTTP, and is an open technology supported across various browsers (for example, Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer). The Principal AMC requires that you use an SSL-enabled browser to communicate with the secure area of our site. You know you are visiting the secure area of our site when the URL begins with **"https://..."**. 

In addition to protecting communications between your browser and our server, SSL is also used to protect communications between our web server and our mainframe system. We have also implemented a firewall to protect all of our systems that are not part of the Internet from intrusion.   
  
Use of Cookies   
  
The www.principalindia.com site, like many web sites, uses "cookies" (information stored on your computer by your browser at our request). Cookies enable the site to "remember" who you are so that you can get around it easier and more efficiently. Cookies allow you to access secured information, conduct secured transactions, and take advantage of promotional opportunities. 

Different web sites store the information in cookies differently. We do not record personal or sensitive information in our cookies. Any such information is stored in our protected systems and not in the cookie or on the Internet.   
  
Definition of Cookies   
A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a web server to a web browser to be read back from that browser. Cookies are a way to have the browser "remember" specific bits of information. 

**Note:** The information stored within a cookie can be read only by the web server that originally sent the cookie. Web servers cannot read cookies sent by other web servers.   
  
Types of Cookies   
The two types of cookies are **session cookies** and **persistent cookies**. The key difference between session cookies and persistent cookies is the time of expiration. 

  * **Session cookies** expire at the end of the session. 
  * **Persistent cookies** do not expire at the end of the session.
