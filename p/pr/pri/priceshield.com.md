**PriceShield Privacy Policy**

**PriceShield is a division of SmartShopper Networks Ltd. ("PriceShield")**

  


At PriceShield, we're committed to your privacy.

 **Our Privacy Policy is simple. We do not collect any personal information about you or your shopping habits (unless you choose to register with us). The information you enter when you search for a product or service is used to automatically compare and find the best deals on the web.  We do  not trade, rent or sell personally identifiable information ("PII") with third parties for marketing or any other purposes.**

**What information do we collect?**

(a) Anonymous Aggregate Information

PriceShield collects and stores aggregated information about the web pages its users view and the data they enter in search engine search fields while using the PriceShield software (the "Service").  PriceShield uses this information to determine which alternative offers to display on your browser window pane.  

For every web page you view while using the Service, the PriceShield software transmits from your computer to the PriceShield server and stores the following information: your Internet Protocol (IP) Address; the Full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the web page you are visiting; general information about your browser and your computer's operating system; your PriceShield cookie number and the date and time the above information is logged.  We also collect and store the following PriceShield usage statistics: what is clicked on the browser window pane; the amount of time the Service is used during each session; which keyword searches are performed and what alternative results are received during any given session.

If you are only visiting our site ([www.priceshield.com](http://www.priceshield.com/)), we collect the following information: the URL of the web page from which you came; your IP Address; the date and time of each page you view; the name of and information about any advertisement that brought you to our web site; and computer and connection information.  If the URL of the page from which you came contains any PII about you, we will not attempt to determine your identity by analyzing the URL in any way.

(b) Personally Identifiable Information

Some of our services may ask that you register.  Registration is optional and you may choose to use the PriceShield program without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself.  If you choose to register, PriceShield asks you for some PII (for example your name, email address, and a city or an airport near you) in order to create an account. 

Any PII which is collected, as described above, is stored separately from the information about the web pages you view and the data you enter in search engine search fields and the two types of information are not correlated or linked. 

Except as provided above, we do not gather PII from you without your specific permission when you visit the PriceShield site and download the PriceShield software or use the Service. 

**Cookies**

Upon visiting [www.priceshield.com](http://www.priceshield.com/), a cookie is sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser.  This cookie assigns your Web browser a unique series of numbers, letters, or characters that enables PriceShield's servers to recognize and identify your web browser when you are using the Service and help customize your online experience and make it more convenient for you.  The cookie improves the quality of our service by getting a better understanding of how people interact with us.  Cookies are also useful in allowing more efficient log-in for users, tracking transaction histories and preserving information between sessions.    

**Clear Gifs**

We and our third party advertising companies employ a software technology called clear gifs (sometimes called web beacons), that help inform us of what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier which are used to track the online movements of users.  Clear gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable information.

**What do we do with the information we collect?**

PriceShield analyzes its logs of usage paths and stored search terms collected from users to build anonymous web usage profiles.  However, PriceShield stores this information separately from PII, and PriceShield does not correlate or link a user's anonymous usage profile to any PII about the user.  PriceShield uses these anonymous web usage profiles and stored search terms to determine alternative offers to display.

PriceShield does not:

(a)    Associate or store non-personally identifiable web usage data or search information with any PII; 

(b)   Analyze such web usage data or search information to determine the identity of any PriceShield user; or

(c)    Use PII to determine which ads and alternative offers to display on your PriceShield browser window pane.
