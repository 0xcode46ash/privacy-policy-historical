> The Princeton Review takes your privacy seriously. First, we only ask you to provide information that we need in order to deliver the service you have requested. Second, we don't share the information you have given us without your explicit permission to do so. Your data is completely secure within our database archives.
> 
> Anonymous Areas  
>  Some areas of our site are accessible without registration of any kind. This is true of all of the basic content areas. Other areas require registration.
> 
> Passive Collection of Data  
>  Like most sites, we maintain logs of site usage in order to evaluate our visitors' interest level in areas of the website, which and how many pages they look at how long they stay on the site, and what Web browsers are being used. This data is tracked in aggregate form, not at an individual user level, and is not uniquely identifying. The aggregate level data will be shared with 3rd parties when requested. 
> 
> Services that Require Registration  
>  Some of our most useful services are personalized: different visitors get different results based on information they provide. Examples include Counselor-O-Matic, Online Tests, The Princeton Review Career Quiz, Student Match, the Aid Comparison Calculator, and any surveys or contests in which you may choose to participate. Registration for these services is required to facilitate customization of your individual results.
> 
> In addition to providing personalized results, registration is important for sending you specific information related to your service, and for allowing you to access stored information. For example, if you subscribed to Word du Jour, your email address is necessary for us to send you the daily service. In Advanced School Search, you are asked to register to save your search criteria so you can access it at a later time.
> 
> The registration includes providing an email address and password. You need to choose a secret password to keep the personal information you entered on Review.com private. In addition, we request your mailing address for certain services so that we can send you the information you request via snail mail.
> 
> If a user elects to use our system to inform a friend about our site, particularly the Word Du Jour feature on our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. The Princeton Review will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. The Princeton Review stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact The Princeton Review at [webmaster@review.com](mailto:webmaster@review.com) to request the removal of this information from our database. 
> 
> Information you provide, including your e-mail address, is uniquely identifying, although not shared with anyone outside The Princeton Review unless you first give us your permission. 
> 
> _Please note, if you do not logout once registered for services that require registration, your personal information could be viewed by other users with access to your computer.To avoid this, each user should sign out when finished using the site, especially when visiting The Princeton Review from a public computer._
> 
> _Please note, if you choose to participate in our online discussion forums, your posts will be publicly accessible, as will the username and e-mail address you use._
> 
> Changing Personal Information  
>  You may unsubscribe to Word du Jour simply by going to the WDJ subscription page and updating your subscription (if you are not logged in, you will be prompted to log in first). 
> 
> If you want to change any of the personal information that you completed when you registered or opt-out of any of the opt-ins that you selected, click the My Prefs link from the top left of any page. You then need to type in your username and password to update e-mail address, password, mailing address, and all other information. 
> 
> Notification of Changes  
>  If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. However, if you have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated your account, then you will not be contacted, nor will your personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
> 
> Requests for Products and Information  
>  The Princeton Review offers several opportunities to receive products or information on- and off-line, either directly from us or from partners like colleges or financial aid providers. You indicate your wish to receive this information by checking a box on a form; unless you ask for it, nothing will be sent to you and nothing will be shared with third parties.
> 
> To fulfill these requests we often need more information than simple site registration. Records of these transactions will generally be kept for customer service purposes. The additional information we ask for will vary depending on what it is you're requesting, but generally includes things like your mailing address, year of graduation, and in the case of requests passed on to colleges, information that you choose to provide regarding your academic and extracurricular activities and interests. This information is then passed on to the third party to fulfill your request; they may have their own data policies that differ from ours. 
> 
> We also provide information in aggregate about users who have opted-in to be contacted by schools and banks and who have performed the following actions regarding that specific school or bank on our web site: 
> 
>   * Number of users who have visited their page on our web site 
>   * Number of users who have clicked on an external link to their page on our web site to their web site 
>   * Number of users who have sent an instant inquiry from their profile page 
>   * Number of users who have listed their school in their favorite schools/locker. 
>   * Number of users who have opened their application 
>   * Number of users who have submitted their application 
> 
If you have opted in to be contacted by a 3rd party, then the actions above could be used to provide you with targeted e-mail. Our schools and banks use a Princeton Review internal e-mailing system to send information that may be of interest to you, if you have opted in. These 3rd parties only receive information in the aggregate and will not receive personally identifiable Information from The Princeton Review; such as your name or e-mail address. However, if you choose to respond to an e-mail from a school or lender, then your response will provide them with your personal contact information. To opt-out of any service, simply go to the "My Prefs" tab in the upper right-hand corner and opt-out of any service you wish.

> What about Those Darn "Cookies"?  
>  You may have heard something about "cookies" and the threat that they pose to your online privacy. Despite what you may have heard, cookies cannot kidnap your loved ones, empty your bank account, or burn your house down. 
> 
> Cookies cannot be used to find your name, e-mail address, or anything that is uniquely identifying about you unless you provide that information. We use cookies for those applications to which we referred earlier that require us to keep track of information to customize results. We also allow you to choose to use a cookie to save your username and password so that you become a registered member of the site, which gives you access to the resources that are protected in the Web site. If you don't have your browser set to accept cookies, certain areas of Review.com will not function properly.
> 
> Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)  
>  Doubleclick, the company that serves our banner advertisements for us, uses a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps them better manage content on our site by informing them what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web user. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and very small, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
> 
> Clear Gifs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same Web site or advertising company. That means, for example, that if a person visited "www.companyX.com", which uses an advertising company's clear gif, the website would read the clear gif's identifier and the advertising company's cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. The information would then go back to the advertising company. To learn more about Doubleclick's use of clear gifs, please go to: [www.doubleclick.com](http://www.doubleclick.com/).
> 
> In addition, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails, to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to know how well customers respond to certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the opt-out section below.
> 
> Partner Privacy Policies  
>  When you click on links and/or ad banners that take you to third-party web sites, you will be subject to the third parties' privacy policies. While we support the protection of privacy on the Internet, The Princeton Review (www.review.com) cannot be responsible for the actions of third parties. We encourage you to read the posted privacy statement whenever interacting with any web site.
> 
> Legal Disclaimer  
>  Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy we may need to disclose personal information when required by law where we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on us. 
> 
> Other Online Privacy Resources  
>  A number of organizations are very actively involved in educating Internet users about privacy issues and are pushing for legislation to preserve your online privacy rights.
