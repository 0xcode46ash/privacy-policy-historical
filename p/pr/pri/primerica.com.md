# Primerica - Privacy Promise

While information is the cornerstone of our ability to provide superior service, our most important asset is our client's trust. Keeping confidential client information secure, and using it only as our clients would want us to, is a top priority for all of us at Primerica and its sister companies in Citigroup Inc. Here, then, is our Promise to our individual clients: We will safeguard, according to strict standards of security and confidentiality, any information our clients share with us. We will limit the collection and use of client information to the minimum we require to deliver superior service to our clients, which includes advising our clients about our products, services and other opportunities, and to administer our business. We will permit only authorized Primerica employees, who are trained in the proper handling of client information, to have access to that information. Employees who violate our Privacy Promise will be subject to our normal disciplinary process. We will not reveal client information to any external organization unless we have previously informed the client in disclosures or agreements, been authorized by the client or are required by law. We will always maintain control over the confidentiality of our client information. We will, however, facilitate relevant offers from reputable companies. These companies are not permitted to retain any client information unless the client has specifically expressed an interest in their products or services. We will tell clients in plain language, initially and at least once annually, how they may remove their names from marketing lists. At any time, clients may contact us to remove their names from marketing lists. Whenever we hire other organizations to provide support services, we will require them to conform to our privacy standards and to allow us to audit them for compliance. For purposes of credit reporting, verification and risk management, we will exchange information about our clients only with reputable reference sources and clearinghouse services. We will not share – internally or externally – personally identifiable medical information for any purpose other than the underwriting or administration of a client's policy, claim or account, or as disclosed to the client when the information is collected, or to which the client consents. We will attempt to keep client files complete, up-to-date, and accurate. We will tell our clients how and where to access conveniently their information (except when we're prohibited by law) and how to notify us about errors, which we will promptly correct. We will continuously assess ourselves to ensure that client privacy is respected. We will conduct our business in a manner that fulfills our Promise to you, our client.

The Primerica Financial Services Companies are dedicated to providing financial solutions for your needs. We are committed to bringing you excellent financial products and superior service. We are also committed to informing you about new products and services that may be useful to you. Additionally, we are committed to protecting information we may have about our clients. If you wish to verify that the information we have about you is correct or if you wish to be taken off any mailing lists we might share with our sister companies, simply write us and tell us. To remove your name from these lists or to examine certain information we have in our files about you, send your name, policy or account number and social security number to us at: Privacy Officer P.O. Box 2318 Duluth, GA 30096-0040.
