Printfection.com uses this information internally to assist in determining changes and/or upgrades to the Web Site, whether to add or discontinue specific products or services, and for internal market analysis purposes. 

In general, we do not disclose Personal Information to third parties without your prior consent. However, we reserve the right to do so in certain limited situations as identified below: 

  1. In the course of providing you the Services, we may at our option use third party service providers to provide some or all of the Services you may request in your use of the Web Site. Example of this include but are not limited to the use of third party vendors to create the products sold to you, or the use of credit card processors to process credit card payments by you (or your customers in the case of a Store Owner) to Printfection.com. We make all commercially reasonable efforts to make sure that these third party vendors use your Personal Information only to the extent necessary to provide the Services to you. However, we cannot guarantee that a third party vendor will not disclose your Personal Information. 
  2. If you purchase product from a Store on the Printfection.com website, we may provide your name, city, state, and country to the particular Store Owner. In our contracts with the Store Owners, we require them not to use or disclose this information except for internal business record keeping purposes and their own marketing purposes only. However, Store Owners may use your Personal Information for marketing purposes only if you have affirmatively opted to receive such marketing materials when you place your order.
