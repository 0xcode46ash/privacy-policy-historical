## Our Privacy Policy in a Nutshell

## When You Visit Our Website

When you visit our website we do not capture personally identifiable information. Our Internet Service Provider uses the information connected to your IP Address to provide us with aggregate data. This means that we know, for example, the percentage of our visitors who use Internet Explorer, but we do not have any individual information on you, your computer, or what you look at on our site.

We do not use persistent cookies on this site. We may use session cookies from time to time. Session cookies expire when you close your browser. You can set your browser to refuse cookies. We only use session cookies to provide you with a better experience on our site; they do not capture personally identifiable information and they do not track your online movements.
