Your privacy is very important to us. The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse respects your concerns about maintaining strict privacy. Any information that you divulge to us is kept in confidence.

We do not collect personally identifiable information (PII) on our web site or otherwise unless you choose to give it to us via our online inquiry form, the online donation form, an electronic mail message, a phone call, or by postal mail. The type of information you provide through our online forms may include email address, name, mailing address, city, state, zip code and phone number, as well as credit card account information for the online donation form. Even when you choose to give us information, we keep it confidential. We will only release your PII if you have given explicit consent. 

We do not sell, rent, share, or otherwise disclose mailing lists or other personally identifiable information with third parties. We maintain records of individuals who contact us for aggregated statistical purposes and for noting our efforts to provide information or assistance. However, we do not provide this information to anyone else unless you give us your consent.

On occasion we are asked by the media or legislative staff for names of individuals who have experienced particular privacy abuses. We do not share such names or other identifying information unless you specifically authorize us to do so. 

If you have given consent for us to release your information, whether to a reporter or legislator or otherwise, and later decide you no longer wish to consent, send an email to [ jbeebe@privacyrights.org](mailto:jbeebe@privacyrights.org), notify us through our inquiry form at [ www.privacyrights.org/inquiryform.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20050325084502id_/http%3A//www.privacyrights.org/inquiryform.html), or contact us by phone or mail.
