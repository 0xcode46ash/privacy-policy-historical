Priscilla of Boston's commitment to privacy  
Priscilla of Boston is committed to maintaining your confidence and trust, and accordingly maintains the following privacy policy to protect the personal information you provide online. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

  
  


What information do we collect? How do we use it?  
Priscilla of Boston collects information online for the sole purpose of fulfilling your requests. When you join our registry, we need to know your name and shipping address. While not required, we also ask that you provide us with additional information about yourself, as well as specific bridal party and wedding information. This allows us to send you special events and offers, and other information custom-tailored to your needs.

  
  


Will we disclose the information collected to outside parties?  
The information collected is sent to the local Priscilla of Boston salon in your area for the purpose of providing you with information regarding special events and offers specific to your area and to provide you with the best possible shopping experience when you visit a store. With your permission, Priscilla of Boston may share your personal information to other May Department store divisions providing offers that we feel would be attractive to our customers. If you wish to permanently opt out of these offers, please send an e-mail to [mkent@priscillaofboston.com](mailto:mkent@priscillaofboston.com).

Also, we may decide to use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our Web site and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that Xnumber of individuals visited a certain area on our Web site, or that Ynumber of women who filled out our registration form are from the northeast U.S., but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.

  
  


How does Priscilla of Boston protect customer information?  
All the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. The information collected when you enter our Bridal Registry is transmitted over an insecure server. Still, in this case, Priscilla of Boston uses industry standard efforts, such as firewalls, to safeguard the confidentiality of your information.  
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

  
  


A special note concerning children's privacy  
The safety of children is obviously very important to us. Children should always ask a parent or guardian for permission before sending personal information to anyone online. Priscilla of Boston does not collect or maintain information at our Web site from those we actually know are under 18.

  
  


Your consent  
By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Priscilla of Boston. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
