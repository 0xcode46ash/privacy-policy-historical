# Privacy Policy | Privy

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) discloses the practices of Privy, Inc. (“Privy”) concerning personal information we obtain about you. By using any of Privy websites, Privy platform, software or equipment (the “Site”), or using other services of Privy (collectively the “Services”), you are accepting the practices described in this Policy. 

Policy notifies you of: (i) what personal information of yours is collected when you access the Site and/or use the Services; (ii) how the information is collected; (iii) how the information is used and shared; (iv) our efforts to maintain the security of Sensitive Personal Information (as defined below); and (v) other details concerning your personal information and our policies. 

This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Privy does not own or control, or to people that we do not employ or manage. Information contained in this Policy may be changed or updated without notice at any time. When you are visiting the Privy Site, you are accepting the current version of this Policy as posted on the Site at that time. Privy recommends that Users revisit this Policy on a regular basis. 

  1. #### Information Collection and Use

Information collected is stored in a secure database, accessible only by Privy and its authorized third parties or agents. Privy collects information about those persons who use, attempt to use, or access Privy’s Site or Services (“Users”): 

    1. ##### Information that may be gathered online

This Site may collect two types of information from Users who access the Site: (i) information gathered by analyzing page views and User navigation patterns, and (ii) information that Users provide directly when they use any of our Services, including but not limited to Sensitive Personal Information. We use page view and navigation information to ensure that Users can find information on our Site as quickly as possible. We use information collected when Users upload documents to check their qualifications and verify their identity. Those Users wishing to post to our Site may be required to register or otherwise provide personal information. Certain other Services may also require collecting personal information and/or registration. These Services include, but are not limited to, subscribing to any of our mailing lists. If you choose not to register and provide personal information, you may not have access to those areas or Services that require registration information. 

    2. ##### Methods we Use for Gathering Information: Usage Tracking.

Privy analyzes user traffic patterns throughout its Site. We do not attempt to identify individual visitors to our Site, but we may collect data on general types of Users based on domain name or browser type. This information is obtained directly from the User’s web browser identification information. By way of example, if you chose to share a certain deal we may post with a friend, we will not store your social media login information, but if you share a deal with a friend using our email plug-in we may store the email address of your friend simply to track the conversion rates of our platform. 

    3. ##### Our Services.

When a User registers for certain Services, the User may be asked to provide certain information, including, but not limited to, name, address, zip code, telephone number, email address, credit card or checking account number, and credit card expiration date (“Sensitive Personal Information”). Once you register with us, you are not anonymous to us. 

    4. ##### Cookies

Privy’s Site may use cookies and files that are similar to cookies. A cookie is a short line of text that is created by a web site and stored in a file on your computer. Cookies are used to store information about your preferences and activity during and after your visit to a web site. Cookies are also used widely in electronic commerce programs to keep track of which items a user has selected for purchase. Cookies cannot gather any information from your computer other than which you provide directly or that which is provided routinely by your browser software. Any User has the right and ability to refuse or delete cookies. However, such refusal or deletion may prevent the User from properly using the Site’s cookie-dependent features. 

  2. #### Use of Information

Information we collect is generally used for the following purposes: 

    1. To build features that will make the Services available on our Site easier to use. This includes faster search requests, better member support and timely notice of new Services and special offers.

    2. To improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze Site usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customize our Sites content, layout, and Services. These uses improve our Services and better tailor them to meet your needs.

    3. To resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Service Terms. At times, we may look across multiple members or Users to identify problems or resolve disputes, and in particular we may examine your information to identify Users using multiple User Ids or aliases.

    4. Sharing of Information. Personal information you provide to us will be shared with our authorized third parties or agents.

    5. We may share your information with Privy merchants. From time to time we may provide offers or coupons from particular merchants (“Privy Merchants”) who, as part of the offer or coupon, request information on Privy customers who purchased the offer or coupon in order to aid redemption. In those cases, we may share some of your Sensitive Personal Information with a Privy Merchant if you engage in an activity in which you provide us with your Sensitive Personal Information (“Identification Activity”) and then only to the Privy Merchant involved in that Identification Activity. We expressly disclaim any responsibility or liability for the actions of such Privy Merchant. We do not have or take any responsibility for the actions of the Privy Merchants and the actions of the Privy Merchant are not in our control. 

We reserve the right to disclose personal information, including Sensitive Personal Information, when we believe that such disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law or a request by a government official, to protect the rights or property of Privy, or to enforce our Service Terms. In the event that Privy or its assets are acquired by a third party, User information and Sensitive Personal Information may be some of the transferred assets. 

  3. #### Agents, Consultants

We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on behalf of Privy. Examples include sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from Users lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing Services. Such agents and/or consultants may have access to Sensitive Personal Information needed to perform their contractual functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 

  4. #### Security

Privy takes several precautions to protect our User’s Sensitive Personal Information, both online and offline. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from this Site may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Sensitive Personal Information to Privy via the Internet. Sensitive Personal Information is also protected offline in our offices. Only Privy employees, authorized third parties or agents who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk or member services representative) or contractual duty are granted access to Sensitive Personal Information. Furthermore, all Privy employees are kept up-to-date on our security practices and changes in those practices. Finally, the servers that Privy uses to store Sensitive Personal Information on are kept in a secure environment. If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to support@privy.com. 

Every User who has an account on this Site is responsible for (i) restricting access to his or her computer; and (ii) keeping the e-mail address associated with that account current. 

Privy may provide email links on its site to further facilitate communication between Privy and you. Information collected through email may be shared with our customer service group, employees or other third parties that perform services on our behalf. Unless otherwise noted, email on our Site is not a completely secure and confidential means of communication. Non-encrypted email may be accessed and viewed by other Internet users without your knowledge and permission while in transit to us. 

Your participation implies your agreement to the terms included in this Privacy Policy. 

  5. #### Other Sites

We may forward Users to other web sites. Please be aware that this Site and Privy may not be responsible for the business and privacy practices of these other web sites. We encourage you to be aware of this when you leave our Site and to read the legal notices and privacy policies of each and every web site you visit. If you use facebook, twitter or other social media for sharing you agree to their terms of service and privacy policy as well. 

  6. #### Children’s Online Privacy Protection
