Primagames.com is committed to protecting the privacy and security of our users. The following privacy policy describes what kind of information we collect and how it is used. We believe that this policy will enable our visitors to protect their privacy while having fun at our site. 

**INFORMATION THAT IS COLLECTED AND HOW IT IS USED**

**A. Overview of Policy**

Primagames.com regularly tracks general data about our site, such as the number of visitors, to improve and enhance our site and its features. Prima uses this general demographic information to tailor our services and features to our users’ needs and preferences. We may share this general data with third parties from time to time. 

In addition, Primagames.com also collects certain personally identifiable information from its users. This information is specific to the user and is used for a variety of purposes as set forth below. The following describes the kinds of personally identifiable information that we collect and how it is used. 

**B. Membership Registration**

Primagames.com requests personally identifying information about you and your interests when you register within the Primagames.com site. Such information may include, but is not limited to, name, address, e-mail address, gender and age and information on the game systems that you use. Primagames.com uses this information to track the overall demographics of our user base. We also use the personal information internally to determine what kinds of features and information to offer our users, to enhance the design and layout of our site, and to inform users of new features, products or offerings on our site. 

Primagames.com may share this registration information with third parties. If we do so, we will require such third parties to use the information only to the extent necessary to provide you their services or to notify you of new products and services. We will also require such third parties to take reasonable measures to protect the security and privacy of this information and to allow our users to request that they not be contacted with unsolicited emails or other communications. 

**C. E-mail Newsletters and E-mail Updates**

When you register as a user of Primagames.com, you will be asked whether you wish to receive our free weekly e-mail newsletter. The newsletter will provide links to hot new information of the Primagames.com web site as well as other information or services that may be of interest to our users. You will also be asked whether you wish to receive regular service announcements about special offers and features on the Primagames.com site. These announcements will be less frequent than our regular e-mail newsletters. We expect to send 6 to 10 such announcements each year. 

Primagames.com does not currently rent or sell its newsletter subscriber lists to third parties. However, the newsletters may contain advertisements and promotions on behalf of third party sponsors or advertisers and we may send you notices on behalf of those sponsors or advertisers. We may also notify our third party sponsors or advertisers of your email address if you have indicated an interest in finding out more about their products and services. We will require our third party sponsors or advertisers to take reasonable measures to protect the security and privacy of your e-mail address. 

If you want to update your e-mail address or want to request that you stop receiving e-mail newsletters or e-mail announcements, please contact us at [webmaster@primagames.com](mailto:webmaster@primagames.com). 

**D. Contests and Promotion**

Primagames.com also requests personally identifiable information about you when you enter one of our contests, sweepstakes or promotions. We may share the personally identifiable information with third parties in the same manner as we share registration information. If you enter a contest or sweepstakes, there will often be a separate set of rules that will govern your participation in such events. You should also review the contest rules for any special arrangements that might apply to that contest. For example, we may notify third parties of your name and address so that they can send you the prize. 

**E. E-Mail Services**

Primagames.com may offer free e-mail services through its site. The use of these services will be governed by a separate agreement that you will be asked to accept when you sign up. You will be requested to provide certain personally identifiable information when you sign up for this service. Prima’s use of that information is described in more detail in the e-mail service agreement. 

**F. Surveys and Polls**

Primagames.com may conduct user surveys or polls from time to time. You are not required to respond to such surveys or polls. We may share the general aggregate data from such polls with third parties to better understand the needs of our users and the effectiveness of the services and advertising on the Primagames.com site. We will share personally identifiable information from such polls with third parties, although we may store such information on our systems for use in developing services and features that suit our users’ needs and interests.
