# Privacy

  
|  We are committed to protecting the privacy and information of our Web site users. To carry out this commitment, we have adopted this privacy policy to help protect your personal information. The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform you of what information this Web site collects, how such information is used, and other related matters.

**Collection of Information**  
Our Web server automatically recognizes the Internet address (and specific domain) from which you are accessing our Web site. When you visit our site, we collect general information that does not identify you specifically but informs us of the pages visited, the areas of the Web site where you have spent the most time, and other Web sites you linked to while visiting our Web site. The above list is meant to be illustrative and not exclusive. This general information is only used in the aggregate so we can improve our services to you and other Web site users.

On certain Web pages, we will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information") or allows us to contact you. If you choose not to register or provide Personal Information, you can still use most of our Web site but you will not be able to access areas that require registration.

**How the Information is used**  
We will protect the confidentiality of any personal information you share with us. We will not sell or share your personal identifiable information with any third party except as required by law. In addition, in the event our business or assets are sold or acquired, the information you provided may become the property of the new owner.

We use the information collected in various ways, including but not limited to responding to any queries regarding our services, emailing you with updates to our services, and providing more efficient services as further described. If you wish not to receive email from us detailing our services or updates, please notify us. We take all the collected general information, compile and analyze all the data, and modify our Web site so it better serves our users' needs. As an example, if we find that the majority of our users tend to go to a certain portion of our Web site, we will move such portion of the Web site closer to the home page or create a link directly to that portion of the Web site. This type of modification to the Web site will make your visit more efficient.

**Tracking**  
We use cookies to help improve our services to you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. Among other things, the cookie will help keep track of information you gave us so you will not have to reenter it each time you enter our Web site.

**Security**  
We use certain standard efforts to authenticate users of our Web site; however; our authentication relies upon the degree to which user ID's and passwords are adequately protected. We do not guarantee the absolute security of our Web site due to the nature of the Internet.

**Submitted Information**  
If a user of our Web site sends us any message or communication, such message or communication will become our property and will not be returned. We shall have the right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, distribute, and display such messages or communications, including the sender's name.

**Third Party Links**  
Our Web site permits you to link to third party Web sites. We do not endorse any information posted on such third party Web sites nor the reliability or authenticity of any such posted information. We do not have any relationship with such third party Web sites other than permitting you to directly link to them for your convenience. Such third party Web sites may be governed by their own rules and regulations and we advise that you read and adhere to such rules and regulations when visiting such third party Web sites. We will have no liability whatsoever for any of your actions on such third party Web sites nor will we be liable for any information or data downloaded by you or any transaction entered into by you while visiting such third party Web sites.
