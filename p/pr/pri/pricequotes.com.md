# PriceQuotes.com - Online Privacy Policy

  
**PriceQuotes.com** respects the privacy rights of its online visitors and is committed to providing a secure environment for them. To demonstrate our commitment, we have adopted an Online Privacy Policy that governs the information collection practices of our Web site. 

Please note, however, that this policy applies only to sites maintained by PriceQuotes.com, and not to web sites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link. When you link to any other sites from the PriceQuotes.com Web site, this Privacy Policy no longer applies and PriceQuotes.com does not control the activities of those sites. 

**What information does PriceQuotes.com collect and how is it used?**

As an online referral service, PriceQuotes.com does not request or solicit information from its visitors at any time. From time to time, however, PriceQuotes.com may collect and temporarily store personal information that you voluntarily submit to us via email correspondence. For example, PriceQuotes.com provides a link through which an online visitor can send e-mail to Support. Any personal information contained in such email is used by PriceQuotes.com for the sole purpose of responding to your questions and/or comments and is deleted immediately after we've responded. Regardless of whether we've successfully responded, any personal information submitted to us in email is deleted within 30 days of its receipt. 

In addition, we only collect and use personal information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to respond to your question and/or comment. Please note that your refusal to provide personal information (e.g., name, telephone number, etc.) in email correspondence may limit our ability to respond to your question or comment in a timely fashion. However, you never have to provide personal information to PriceQuotes.com in order to use our Web site. 

**Log Files**

The only other information collected by PriceQuotes.com is in the form of logs - files that record Web site activity, including how many "hits" a particular Web page is getting (a.k.a. "click-through data"). For example, log file entries are generated every time a visitor clicks "Get Price Quote" on our site. These entries are generated anonymously, and enable PriceQuotes.com to assess overall site activity, track interest in advertised sales, and troubleshoot technical concerns. We also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the referral services we provide you. Log files are used internally only, and are not associated with any particular user, computer or browser. 

**Third Parties**

Through the use of frames, PriceQuotes.com also allows visitors to submit information about cars, such as a car's make, model and year. In addition, once a visitor has clicked for a price quote, the visitor may be asked to supply additional information, including personally identifiable information (e.g., name, address and telephone number). Please be aware, however, that such information is not collected or used by PriceQuotes.com at any time; the information is collected and used exclusively by the third party companies displayed on our site. In addition, any web page on which such information is collected is operated by the third party displayed on such page, not by PriceQuotes.com. PriceQuotes.com is not responsible for the information collection and use practices of these third parties and we recommend that you refer to the privacy policy of each third party company. If you do not want your information to be handled by these third parties, you can choose not to allow the collection of information by not using that particular service or by not providing any information at that time. 

**Does PriceQuotes.com use cookies or track IP Addresses?**

PriceQuotes.com does not place cookies on the systems of our site visitors. A "cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that many Web sites store on a user's computer. Cookies do not include people's names, e-mail addresses, or other information that is personally identifiable; they are used by many sites to quickly identify your computer, saving you the time you would normally spend registering or entering your password again. 

We do not keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet. 

**Can I choose how my personal information is used?**

If you do not want PriceQuotes.com to reply to your question or comment, you may opt-out from receiving a response by contacting us at [Support@PriceQuotes.com](mailto:Support@PriceQuotes.com) and we will be happy to honor your request. 

**How do I access my personal information?**

If you wish to correct personal information submitted to us via email so that we may successfully respond to your question or comment, please send a second email to [Support@PriceQuotes.com](mailto:Support@PriceQuotes.com) providing us with the correct information. 

**Does PriceQuotes.com collect personal information from children under 13?**

PriceQuotes.com does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13, including personal information submitted to us via email. We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from young children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without permission, when on-line. No information should be submitted to PriceQuotes.com in the form of email correspondence by children 12 and under. 

**What safeguards does PriceQuotes.com use to protect my personal information?**

Because PriceQuotes.com does not store or use any personal information about its visitors other than for email correspondence, PriceQuotes.com does not have any mechanisms in place to ensure data quality, such as the accuracy of information submitted (via email) by visitors to our site. We do, however, maintain appropriate safeguards to ensure the security and privacy of the information you provide us via email by destroying such information within 30 days of its receipt. 

**How do I ask a question or file a complaint?**

Any questions or complaints about PriceQuotes.com or this privacy statement can be resolved by contacting PriceQuotes.com via email at [Support@PriceQuotes.com](mailto:Support@PriceQuotes.com).
