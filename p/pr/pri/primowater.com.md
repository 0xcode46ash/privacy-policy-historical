To provide you with superior service, Primo Water Corporation and its subsidiaries ("Primo," "we" or "us") may collect certain personal information from you when you visit our website. When you submit this information, it will help us to provide you with faster personalized service and it may allow you to access certain promotions, special offers and information about new products and services. We recognize, however, and are committed to protecting, your need for privacy and security as you visit our website.

To demonstrate this commitment, we created this privacy and security statement (this "Statement") to explain to you our online information gathering and dissemination practices and to inform you about the choices you can make about the way such information is collected and used. We reserve the right to change this Statement at any time. Please take a few minutes to read this Statement so you can understand how information is used and the specific measures we take to protect your personal information.

This Statement covers the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information that may be collected by us anytime you interact with us by visiting our website, purchasing our products or when interacting with a Primo customer service representative.

**Collection of Personally Identifiable Information**  
Generally, no personally identifiable information, such as your name or mailing address, will be collected by us when you visit the our website, nor is its submission required for you to visit our website. Occasionally, Primo may offer website programs such as contests, sweepstakes, promotions, surveys, or online services. To participate in these programs, you must have a valid e-mail and mailing address, and you may be required to provide personal information (which may include, but not be limited to, your name, password, telephone numbers, email addresses, mailing addresses, demographic information, and other data) (collectively, "Personal Information"). In addition, there are portions of this website where we may need to collect Personal Information from you for a specific purpose, such as to provide you with information requested by you. We will not collect any Personal Information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. Your decision to provide such information and participate in such programs will be entirely voluntary.

**Use of Personal Information**  
Primo will be the sole owner of all Personal Information collected through the programs referred to in the preceding paragraph and this website. If you decide to voluntarily provide Primo with Personal Information in relation to one of our website programs, we will store such information in protected databases on secured servers with restricted access.

When Personal Information is collected from you, we will let you know how we will use the Personal Information. In addition to our website and programs, we may use the Personal Information you provide to respond to your inquiry or to process your request for information. Primo will not share or sell your Personal Information with any third party for its marketing use. We may share your Personal Information with other companies we have hired to provide us with specific services. Your Personal Information will only be used by these third parties (or their subcontractors) to perform the assigned services for which they were hired.

Also, through a hosting company for our website, we may collect certain additional information from you as a visitor to our website, such as Internet addresses and browser version and type. This information may be logged by us or our hosting company to help diagnose technical problems, and to administer the website in order to improve the quality of our service. We may also track and analyze non-identifying information and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such anonymous statistical information to third parties. It may not be readily apparent that this information is being collected.

**Opting Out of Information Collection**  
Our website allows visitors to opt-out of receiving communication when we request Personal Information from you, or through other means as identified.
