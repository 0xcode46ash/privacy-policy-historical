# PriceRunner UK Privacy Policy

At Pricerunner.com ("we", "us", "Site") we respect your privacy and want to ensure that each and every member feels comfortable in sharing their personal data. We make every effort to keep your information confidential and protect your privacy when using our site and services. We take your privacy and our responsibility under the privacy laws very seriously. Pricerunner is the data controller, for the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998, in respect of the information which you provide to us.

Please read this privacy policy carefully since by visiting the Site and sharing information with us you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy unless you offer different terms which are accepted by us in writing. Read through the document, or click on any of these links to jump to that point in the document.

## I. Information We Collect

### A. Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

PriceRunner does not automatically collect any personal information about you. We do collect PII, including but not limited to your name, e-mail address, geographical location, age and gender, through membership registration, newsletter sign-up requests or promotional contests. Please note that it is not necessary for you to become a member in order to use many of the features on Pricerunner.com, a non-member can easily see products and prices, perform searches, read reviews and take advantage of many other useful features on the site.

PriceRunner also operates a free e-newsletter service - the PriceRunner Update - to help you keep up-to-date with the best deals, contests and PriceRunner news. This is an opt-in service so, as a member, you will receive the newsletter. To unsubscribe simply send an e-mail to infouk@pricerunner.com and include your e-mail address.

The reason that we ask for this PII is to provide you with information that you may request, to customize your experience on the Site, and to contact you when necessary in connection with any promotions you participate in.

We also use this information for internal business purposes, such as aggregating the data to help us to create a profile of PriceRunner visitors, as a whole, so that we can; a) build a better understanding of our users and enhance the services we offer, and b) attract advertisers to spend money on PriceRunner, thus enabling our free price comparison service to operate.

Unless you direct us not to, we may use your personal information to contact you about offers or promotions from PriceRunner and selected third parties we think you would be interested in.

### B. Non-Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

PriceRunner uses cookies (a small text file containing a unique string of numbers or letters that is placed on a computer) to ‘remember’ your computer when you visit the site. Using cookies helps us serve ads, take polls and better manage the services we offer. This will not collect any personally identifiable information about you. Cookies do not recognize you as a person, just your computer. They cannot be used to obtain other information from your hard drive.

For each visitor to our website, our Web server automatically recognizes only the visitor's IP address. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. Upon visiting our website, we assign each visitor a unique ID that is used to track visitor traffic patterns within our website. We also collect aggregate and user-specific information on the pages that visitors access or visit. We reserve the right to retain all website traffic reporting data as long as may be reasonably necessary for accounting and auditing purposes.

## II. Information Sharing

PriceRunner may use third party vendors to help us operate our business and this Site or administer activities on our behalf. We may share your information with these third parties for those limited purposes. Any third-party vendor so used has agreed to protect the confidentiality of information provided by PriceRunner.

PriceRunner and/or our marketing partners may enhance and/or merge PII with commercially-available third party data collected from other sources in an effort to ensure that the messages being sent to the consumer in online and/or offline marketing programs are relevant to their interests. In the event we enhance and/or merge such personally identifiable information with data collected from other sources, we will take reasonable steps to maintain the integrity and quality of that information.

PriceRunner may share PII (including information that has been enhanced with information from other sources) with co-branded partners, advertisers, third party marketers, our affiliated entities for their online and/or offline marketing programs or in connection with the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial asset, reorganization or liquidation of any PriceRunner division.

Please note that while PriceRunner encourages merchants and marketing partners to adopt responsible approaches to online marketing, we are not responsible for the information practices of our merchants or marketing partners. The collection, use, and disclosure of information by such third parties is subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ from this policy. Please be sure to review their policy prior to providing any information.

PriceRunner may release account and any other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to respond to a subpoena or otherwise comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of PriceRunner or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.

## III. Consumer Choice And Access

If at anytime you no longer wish to receive offers from a PriceRunner, you may "unsubscribe" by sending an email to infouk@pricerunner.com or by using the unsubscribe option within any promotional offer. In compliance with the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, you will be removed entirely from our email list and will no longer receive offers from us. If you have registered or submitted PII under more than one email account, you must submit separate unsubscribe requests from each account.

The Cookies we use do not have an "opt-out" option, yet you still have the option of blocking the use of cookies by changing a setting in your Internet browser. Please see your browser supplier's website for details on how to do this.

PriceRunner sends a confirming email for each member registration. You may change, correct or update your information by email by contacting infouk@pricerunner.com. Changing or deleting your information or otherwise opting-out of receipt of communications from the PriceRunner will change or delete the data only in our database for purposes of transacting future business on our sites and for managing future communications from PriceRunner. These changes and deletions will not change or delete information already collected as part of a particular transaction.

## IV. Security

PriceRunner employs industry standard security measures to ensure the security of all data. Any data that is stored on Pricerunner’s servers are treated as proprietary and confidential and is not available to the public. Access is password-protected and limited to individuals at whose job responsibilities require the access.

No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of PriceRunner to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your PII, PriceRunner cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. You acknowledge and assume this risk when communicating with us.

## V. Consent And Changes

PriceRunner may find it necessary or be legally obligated to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post those changes on this page and update the effective date so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. Except as otherwise required by law, modifications to this Privacy Policy will not affect the privacy of data collected by PriceRunner prior to the effective date of the policy change unless we provide you direct notice and the opportunity to opt-out of such proposed change.

## VI. Children's Privacy And Spam

PriceRunner is very sensitive to the issue of children's privacy and makes every effort to protect the privacy of children using the Internet. PriceRunner's web sites, products, and services are not developed for or directed at children. If you believe your child has provided PriceRunner with any personally identifiable data by registering at a PriceRunner web site, please contact infouk@pricerunner.com to have them removed.

PriceRunner is committed to proper Internet practices and full compliance with the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003. It is our policy to prohibit the sending of unsolicited or "Spam" email by PriceRunner or any of its marketing partners.

Please note that under the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, an advertiser is required to provide an opt-out mechanism for consumers to unsubscribe from future emails about the advertiser. Although not required to by law, many email marketers also include an opt-out mechanism to enable consumers to be removed from their mailing list. This has caused some confusion for consumers in opting out. The table below clarifies which opt-out mechanism you should use.

| To receive no further emails | Opt-Out Mechanism to Use  
---|---  
about the advertiser | Advertiser's  
about the email marketing company | Marketer's  
from the advertiser or email marketing company | Both  
  
## VII. Data Processing

You acknowledge that PriceRunner operates in the United State and the European Union and agree to (i) permit PriceRunner to transmit and use your User information anywhere necessary, including across international boundaries, to affect the services and transactions provided by this Site; and (ii) that such use by PriceRunner shall be subject to the terms and conditions stated in this Privacy Statement and our Terms and Conditions.

## VIII. Limitation Of Liability, Third Party Information & Language

You understand and agree that any dispute over privacy is subject to the terms and conditions of this privacy policy and our terms and conditions (including limitations on damages, and arbitration of disputes). You agree that PriceRunner’s liability for any breach of this privacy policy shall be limited to the value of the transactions or services provided to you by PriceRunner to the extent such claim is not otherwise barred by our terms and conditions. Nothing in this agreement limits or excludes either party's liability for fraud or for negligence causing death or personal injury.

You also agree that you have provided notice to, and obtained consent from, any third party individuals whose personal data you supply to PriceRunner with regard to: (a) the purposes for which such third party's data has been collected; (b) the intended recipients or categories of recipients of the third party's personal data; (c) which of the third party's data are obligatory and which data, if any, are voluntary; and (d) how the third party can access and, if necessary, rectify the data held about them.
