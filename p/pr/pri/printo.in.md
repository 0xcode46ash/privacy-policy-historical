 **INFORMATION COLLECTED**  
Personal information is collected by us when you choose to provide it to us when registering for a Printo service, such as when you choose to enter a Printo promotion or choose to receive a Printo newsletter. In addition, if you choose to contact any of our customer service representatives, we may keep a record of that correspondence so that we may fully address the subject matter.

Aggregate information, such as demographic statistics of our users (e.g. average age or geographical allocation of our users), number of visitors and average time spent on a Printo service, is also considered non-personal information.

This information is collected or derived by us in the course of operating the Printo services. For example, our Web servers may automatically collect non-personal information which is provided through your browser or stored on a cookie or through a Web Beacon when you choose to visit a Printo service.

* If you haveÂ indicated that you were interested in receiving offers or information from Printo or certain of our selected sponsors or advertisers, Printo may send you email materials and other mailings about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. If at any time you would like to end your subscription to any such email materials, please contact us
