**Electronic Message and Email Security**

Messages traveling through the Internet using email processes are subject to viewing, alteration, and copying by potentially anyone on the Internet. We encourage customers to send confidential correspondence through either the postal service, or by using the telephone to speak directly to our employees. We are not responsible for the security or confidentiality of communications you send to us through the Internet using the email process. 

If you want to opt-out of solicitations, you may use our [opt-out reply form](https://www.principal.com/general/optout.shtml). Messages generated through this form will reach us via an encrypted communications link established through our web server and the browser systems, not through an actual email process. 

**Secure Server Software**

To ensure the security of your confidential account information, we use proven security software to encrypt the information before it is transmitted through the Internet. We only allow confidential information to be submitted for transmission if your browser is compatible with our security software. If your browser is not compatible, you will receive a message indicating your transaction can not be completed because of the security risk.
