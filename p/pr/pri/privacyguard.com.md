 Security  
  
Securing your personal and non-personal information is very important to us. We attempt to provide for the secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers by utilizing encryption software. However, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, we can not guarantee that communications between you and Trilegiant Corporation, and Trilegiant Corporation and you, will be free from unauthorized access by third parties, such as hackers. Only those Trilegiant Corporation employees who need access to your information in order to perform their duties are allowed such access. Any employee who violates our privacy and/or security policies may be subject to disciplinary action, including possible termination and civil and/or criminal prosecution.

PrivacyGuard utilizes Standard SSL encryption on pages where secure information is transmitted over the Internet. We also use Verisign as our Certificate of Authority. If you would like more information on PrivacyGuard Verisign Certificate, click on the seal below.
