# Privacy Policy | prAna

### At prAna, we respect your privacy. We know it’s important to you and it’s important to us.

#### The Information We Collect

In order to make your experience at prAna.com the best it can be, we need to collect certain personal information such as your name, address, phone number, email address and credit card information. This makes it easier for us to contact you if we have questions about billing and shipping. It also helps us get your order to you as soon as possible.

We also collect information about your computer and web usage, such as your IP address, operating system, browser type, time and date of access, and the websites you visit before and after prAna.com. This allows us to analyze our users’ behavior so we can improve our website and your overall experience.

Like most websites, prAna.com uses cookies to identify users. Keeping track of your preferences, cookies make it possible for us to provide you with the content and products we think you’ll like most. Cookies are also the reason items stay in your cart after you leave our site. In addition, they’re used to populate your entire user name or email address in a field after you’ve only entered the first few letters. You always have the ability to erase or disable cookies by changing the preferences in your web browser (usually found in the Internet Options menu). The information prAna gathers through cookies is never shared with third parties.

#### How We Use Your Information

In some cases we may provide your name and address to a select group of companies whose products you may find of interest. If you do not want us to share this information with these companies, [click here](mailto:info@prana.com) and we can add your name to our "do-not-share" list. It may take up to 6 weeks for your name to be removed and to stop receiving catalogs. Please provide your email address and mailing address.

If you receive our emails and catalogs and no longer wish to, just let us know at [info@prana.com](mailto:info@prana.com).

Rest assured, your personal information is always safe, thanks to our HTTPS and SSL security protocols.

#### Third-Party Links

If you click on a link for Facebook, Twitter or any other third-party website, you should know that prAna’s privacy policy will not apply on those sites. It’s always a good idea to read the privacy policy of a website if you’re concerned.

#### Children’s Privacy

prAna complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, which prohibits collecting personal information from children under the age of 13. If it comes to our attention that we have unknowingly collected information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete it as soon as possible.

#### Information Changes

If any of your personal information changes when you move or get a new phone number, you can easily update it in your [account settings](https://web.archive.org/customer/account/index/).

If we update our privacy policy, we’ll make the change very clear, right here on this page. If it’s a major change, we’ll email you to make sure you know about it.

If you’re ever unsure of how our privacy policy works, email us at [info@prana.com](mailto:info@prana.com).
