# Prague - Privacy Policy

Prague TV Privacy Policy

The following policy is intended to explain how your personal information will be treated as you make use of our site and its features. 

Instant E-mail response feature

Prague TV offers an "Respond instantly by email" feature , allowing site visitors to send an e-mail to the address provided by the bulletin board post submitter. In order for this feature to function, we ask for e-mail addresses for the recipient (so we know who to mail the message to) and from the sender (so we can tell the recipient who sent the e-mail). We do not store or save these addresses and you will not receive e-mail or other communications from Prague TV or any of our partners as a result of having used this feature. 

"Respond instantly by email" is a mail service that individual visitors to Prague TV make use of to send individual e-mails. While this tool cannot be used to send mass "spam" mailings, Prague TV has no control over how our visitors use it, and any e-mail sent through it originates with, and is the responsibility of, the sender, not Prague TV. 

Other disclosure of personal information

Prague TV will not otherwise use or disclose your personal information without your consent except (i) as described in this privacy policy, or (ii) as required by law, court order or as requested by other government or law enforcement authority. This policy does not protect information you post to the bulletin board or public forum within our web site. 

Other sites

Prague TV contains many links to other sites on the Web. We cannot control and are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other Web sites. 

Who can I ask if I have any additional questions?

If you have any further questions or concerns about our privacy policy and use of personal information, please send them to [privacy@prague.tv](mailto:privacy@prague.tv).
