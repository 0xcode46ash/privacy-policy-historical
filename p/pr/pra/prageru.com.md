# Privacy Policy | PragerU

We at Prager University Foundation respect your concerns about privacy and value the relationship we have with you. This Privacy Notice describes the types of personal information we collect, how we may use that information, and with whom we may share it. Our Privacy Notice also describes the measures we take to protect the security of the information. In addition, we describe the choices you can make about how we use the information you provide to us. We also tell you how you can reach us to update your contact information, remove your name from our mailing lists, or answer any questions you may have about our privacy practices. We maintain full confidentiality of all sponsors and contributors on our mailing and email lists, which will not be sold with any other organization or commercial enterprise. We do share some information as described below.

##  Information We Collect and How We Use It

As you use our site, we may ask you for certain information, including but not limited to your name, email address, postal address and telephone number.  Such information is provided voluntarily by you.  In general, you can visit the site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself; however, you must provide personal information in order to subscribe to PragerU email alerts or register with the site.  

##  E-mail Communications

When you ask us to send you e-mail such as our free e-mail newsletter, you may provide us with certain information like your e-mail address so we can fulfill your request. You may choose to provide additional information as well, such as your postal address and phone number. 

##  Donations

When you make a donation through our Web site (for example, by sponsoring a course or giving a general donation), we may ask you to submit certain personal information (such as credit card information) so we can process your donation. We use the credit card information you provide only to fulfill the transaction you requested. We maintain that information in our customer service records in the event you ask for a tax write off letter. We also maintain your contact information in our records so we can contact you to provide information about new courses and information on additional giving opportunities. You may opt-out from our mailing list at any time. 

##  Questionnaires and Surveys

We occasionally may ask our students to complete online surveys and opinion polls through our newsletter. These surveys help us understand the needs of our visitors. We do not keep any personal information about you in connection with your participation in a Web site survey unless you specifically agree to provide this information. You may opt-out of the newsletter at any time.

Prager University Foundation does not sell, rent, or otherwise disclose personal information about our Web site visitors, except as described here. We share information provided by our Web site visitors with service providers that we have retained to perform services on our behalf - for example, to process donations. These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements. In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law, (ii) in response to a request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity. 

##  Links to Other Sites

Occasionally we provide links to other Web sites for your convenience and information. These sites operate independently from our site and are not under our control. These sites may have their own privacy notices in place, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit any linked Web sites. We are not responsible for the content of these sites, any products or services that may be offered through these sites, or any other use of these sites. 

##  Do we use cookies?

Yes. Cookies are small files that a website or its service provider transfers to your hard drive through the Web browser. This enables the site to recognize your browser, then capture and remember certain information, like items left in your shopping cart and certain other preferences for future visits. 

You can set your computer preferences to warn you when a cookie is sent, or you can turn them off completely. Like most website, if you turn off cookies, our website may not function properly. However, you can still place orders over the phone by calling customer service.

##  Pragerpedia Mobile App

By downloading our mobile app and entering your email address you consent to receive information from PragerU for new video releases and other organizational updates. By providing PragerU a mobile telephone number, you agree to receive autodialed and prerecorded message calls at that number and text messages that will be sent using an automated dialing system. We may place such calls or texts to (i) notify you regarding your account; (ii) troubleshoot problems with your account (iii) resolve a dispute; (iv) collect a debt; (v) poll your opinions through surveys or questionnaires, (vii) contact you with offers and promotions; or (viii) as otherwise necessary to service your account or enforce this User Agreement, our policies, applicable law, or any other agreement we may have with you. The ways in which you provide us a mobile telephone number include, but are not limited to, providing a mobile telephone number at account opening, adding a mobile telephone number to your account at a later time, providing it to one of our employees, opting in via keyword, or by contacting us from that mobile phone number. If a mobile telephone number is provided, you consent to receive SMS or text messages at that number. We won’t share your phone number with non-affiliated third parties for their purposes without your consent, but may share your phone numbers with our Family of Companies or with our service providers, who may contact you using autodialed or prerecorded message calls or text messages. Standard telephone minute, text message and data rate charges may apply. You can opt-out of receiving SMS messages by texting STOP to 64600. If you have any questions, reply HELP to any of our messages, text HELP to 64600 or contact us: <https://www.prageru.com/contact-us>. You will receive up to 12 SMS text alerts from PragerU a month. 

##  Security

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized disclosure, use, alteration or destruction of the personal information in our possession. When you provide credit card information to make a donation, we use the industry standard for Internet security to help protect the information you provide. This Internet encryption standard scrambles data as it travels from your computer to our server. Please note, however, that perfect security does not exist on the Internet.
