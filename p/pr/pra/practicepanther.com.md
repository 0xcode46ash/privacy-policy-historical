**Retention of Information**

We will retain your information for as long as deemed necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.

**Cross-Border Transfer of Information**

PracticePanther has servers in different parts of the world to protect your data should a natural disaster occur in one area. Your personal information is therefore transferred across all of our servers as a backup precaution. By using our Website or our Application, you consent to the transfer of your personal information across numerous countries which may be outside of your country of residence and may have different data protection rules from your country.

**How we protect your information**

We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information and data stored on our Site and App.

Sensitive and private data exchange between the Site or App and its Users happens over a SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures.

Our SSL protocol encrypts your credit card and billing data to the strictest standards. As we all know, there is never 100% protection on the internet and we will do our best to ensure there are no security vulnerabilities. Please note that any information you transmit via our website is secured but we cannot warrant the security of any information transmitted. Please make sure to check your computer for viruses, spyware, and malware, on a regular basis to ensure no one can access your computer. If you feel that your account has been compromised or that there is a potential security flaw within our Application or Website, please [contact us](http://www.practicepanther.com/contact/) immediately.

**Sharing your personal information**

We may use third party service providers to help us operate our business and the Site or App or administer activities on our behalf, such as sending out newsletters or surveys. We may share your information with these third parties for those limited purposes.

**Canceling your Account**

Your information and data is important and we want to make sure it’s safe and protected. Our App uses an API to securely transmit information from our server to other partners. While we will do our best to ensure as much of your information is deleted, we can not ensure that every trace of data will be erased across the other servers.

PracticePanther will not be responsible or liable for your intentional or accidental cancellation of your account or deletion of data and records as well as the cross-border transfer of your data between our servers or disclosure of Client data.

PracticePanther Inc has the discretion to update this privacy policy at any time. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the top of this page. We encourage Users to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect.
