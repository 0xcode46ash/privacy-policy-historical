##  Practical Action privacy policy 

We take your privacy seriously, whether you’re visiting our websites or contacting us in other ways. We know that sharing your information with us takes great trust, so we want you to be confident it’s being looked after. We’ve explained how we collect it and how we use it below.

##  On our websites 

Like most websites, we use data from our servers as well as cookies to get a better understanding of the way people use our websites. We don’t collect personal information that would identify you, unless you choose to share that with us. You don’t have to give any personal data to us – doing that is voluntary.

####  What are cookies?

A cookie is a small piece of data, which is stored on your device (eg. computer or mobile device).

Here at Practical Action, we use cookies to:

  * collect anonymous data on how visitors use our website
  * allow targeted advertising on other websites



We don’t store any information that would identify you personally in the cookies we create, but we do look at trends and patterns to try to improve your experience of using our website.

####  Accepting or blocking cookies

You don’t have to do anything to accept cookies set by Practical Action: by continuing to use this site you are giving your consent to receive them. If you do want to block cookies, you need to do this by changing the settings in your browser to reject them from this site. [Read more on how to block cookies.](https://web.archive.org/managing-cookies)

####  How do we use this information?

We analyse trends and patterns in the data, so that we can improve your experience. It helps us to identify problems with the website, ensure we are giving users the information they need, and to monitor the number of people we are reaching with our work.

We don’t share any personal data that you supply, although we may share information about general user trends with our partners and donors. We also don’t track user behaviour after you have left our site, although you may see Practical Action banners on other websites.

####  Advertisements on other websites

After visiting our websites, you may see personalised banner advertisements on other websites. This relates to content which has been viewed whilst browsing our websites on your computer or other devices.

We use reputable third party specialist partners to do this, again using cookies placed on your computer or other device. You can block cookies from your browser if you would like to prevent this. [Read more on how to block cookies.](https://web.archive.org/managing-cookies)

####  Online donations

All your transactions are secure and meet strict compliance standards including HMRC, the Charity Commission, Payment Card Industry (data security standards) and the Data Protection Act.

This means any data sent to and from our secure servers, is encrypted to prevent any possible fraud. Credit card details are not kept following a transaction. Our online donations are managed by [Blackbaud](http://www.blackbaud.co.uk/) and [WorldPay](http://www.worldpay.com/about_us/index.php?page=privacy&c), and donations can also be made through the third-party PayPal service.

##  Our website and other sources 

####  Email addresses

We may ask you for an email address so we can:

  * send you news and information on Practical Action's work in the form of an e-newsletter (only if you choose to sign up for this service)
  * follow up a request for information, to make sure we have provided you with everything you need
  * follow up a feedback form, to ask you for more details.



If you’ve given us your email address when downloading job details, supporting resources, or technical information, it will only be used to follow up that request or supply updates on our materials.

We do not share personal information, including your email address, for third parties to contact you with their own information. We may have to share your details within Practical Action, or with our third party partners who are part of our process to communicate with you, always in line with data protection legislation, but nothing beyond this.

####  Storage of information

We don’t store your payment details at Practical Action. Other information provided to us, such as your name or address, is saved indefinitely and may be stored on one or more databases directly managed by us or a specialist approved service provider.

####  Our commitment to supporters

We promise not to sell or take part in arrangements which share the details of supporters, enquirers or any other data. We do not ‘cold call’ or use telemarketing to recruit new supporters. [Our Supporter Charter](https://practicalaction.org/support/my-practical-action/supporter-charter)

                                 If you decide to support us, we may contact you from time to time. We’ll use the channel you have said you prefer, to update you on projects you’ve supported, new projects we think you might want to support or just to gain your feedback to see whether we can improve anything.

You can contact us at any time if you'd like to change the way we contact you or the details we use to keep in touch.
