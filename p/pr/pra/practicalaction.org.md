##  How we use this information

Practical Action uses data collected from log files and cookies for internal analysis of user behaviour and trends, to evaluate traffic flow (eg. busiest times of day/week) and to assess the relative popularity of different parts of the website. We use the information we collect to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our site, and to help us make our site more useful to visitors.

We do not share individual data, although we may share aggregate information with partners and donors. We do not track user behaviour after you have left our site.

##  Practical Answers technical information service

We collect basic information about users of Practical Answers at the point of download, ie. when a user requests a Technical document. This includes email address, potential number of beneficiaries, country of use and nature of user. Email addresses are collected to identify users for the analysis of trends, and where permission is given, to contact users subsequently to enquire after the effectiveness of our materials and supply updates about our work. Email addresses are not used for any other purpose, and will not be shared with any third party.

##  E-mail addresses

We sometimes ask you for an e-mail address. This will be:

  * to send you news and information on Practical Action's work and campaigns in form of an e-newsletter (only available by specific request);
  * to follow up a request for technical information, so as to measure the effectiveness of that information;
  * to take a campaign action; or
  * to follow up a feedback form, in order to get a better picture of our audience's needs



If you sign up for an e-newsletter or take a campaign action, the e-mail address you supply will only be used to send you information on Practical Action's work. If you give us your e-mail address when downloading technical information, that address will only be used to follow up that request or supply updates on our technical information.

With the exception of credit card details, the information provided to Practical Action is saved indefinitely and may be stored on one or more databases directly maintained by us.
