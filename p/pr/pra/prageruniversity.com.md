# Privacy Policy | PragerU

We at Prager University Foundation respect your concerns about privacy and value the relationship we have with you. This Privacy Notice describes the types of personal information we collect, how we may use that information, and with whom we may share it. Our Privacy Notice also describes the measures we take to protect the security of the information. In addition, we describe the choices you can make about how we use the information you provide to us. We also tell you how you can reach us to update your contact information, remove your name from our mailing lists, or answer any questions you may have about our privacy practices. We maintain full confidentiality of all sponsors and contributors on our mailing and email lists, which will neither be sold to nor exchanged with any other organization or commercial enterprise. We do share some information as described in the section below titled, Information We Share. 

##  Information We Collect and How We Use It

You may choose to provide personal information (such as your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address) either by phone, mail or on our Web site. Here are the ways you may provide the information and the types of information you may submit. We also tell you how we may use the information. 

##  E-mail Communications

When you ask us to send you e-mail such as our free e-mail newsletter, you may provide us with certain information like your e-mail address so we can fulfill your request. You may choose to provide additional information as well, such as your postal address and phone number. 

##  Get a Gift from Prager University

If you take advantage of our Gift Promotions (such as the 4th of July Declaration Kit) we ask for your name, mailing and e-mail addresses. We use your name and address only to send the gift you requested. We donâ€™t keep your information or use it for any other purpose.

##  Donations

When you make a donation through our Web site (for example, by sponsoring a course or giving a general donation), we may ask you to submit certain personal information (such as credit card information) so we can process your donation. We use the credit card information you provide only to fulfill the transaction you requested. We maintain that information in our customer service records in the event you ask for a tax write off letter. We also maintain your contact information in our records so we can contact you to provide information about new courses and information on additional giving opportunities. You may opt-out from our mailing list at any time. 

##  Questionnaires and Surveys

We occasionally may ask our students to complete online surveys and opinion polls through our newsletter. These surveys help us understand the needs of our visitors. We do not keep any personal information about you in connection with your participation in a Web site survey unless you specifically agree to provide this information. You may opt-out of the newsletter at any time. 

##  Contact Prager University Foundation

You may choose to contact us through our Web site. We provide online forms so you may, for example, (1) ask a question, (2) update your email address or (3) request more information. We use the information you provide on these forms to fulfill your request. We use the information you provide to respond to your inquiries. 

Prager University Foundation does not sell, rent, trade or otherwise disclose personal information about our Web site visitors, except as described here. We share information provided by our Web site visitors with service providers that we have retained to perform services on our behalf - for example, to process donations. These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements. In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law, (ii) in response to a request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity. 

##  Links to Other Sites

Occasionally we provide links to other Web sites for your convenience and information. These sites operate independently from our site and are not under our control. These sites may have their own privacy notices in place, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit any linked Web sites. We are not responsible for the content of these sites, any products or services that may be offered through these sites, or any other use of these sites. 

##  Do we use cookies?

Yes. Cookies are small files that a website or its service provider transfers to your hard drive through the Web browser. This enables the site to recognize your browser, then capture and remember certain information, like items left in your shopping cart and certain other preferences for future visits. 

You can set your computer preferences to warn you when a cookie is sent, or you can turn them off completely. Like most website, if you turn off cookies, our website may not function properly. However, you can still place orders over the phone by calling customer service.

##  Security

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized disclosure, use, alteration or destruction of the personal information in our possession. When you provide credit card information to make a donation, we use the industry standard for Internet security to help protect the information you provide. This Internet encryption standard scrambles data as it travels from your computer to our server. Please note, however, that perfect security does not exist on the Internet.

##  Your Choices

If you would like to update your contact information or prefer not to receive certain communications from us (such as e-mail), please call or write us using one of the options provided below or email us at Info@Prageruniversity.com

##  Updates to this Privacy Notice
