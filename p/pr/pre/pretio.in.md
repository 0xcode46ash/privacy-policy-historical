# Pretio Interactive - Engagement and Monetization for Online Publishers

We care about your privacy 

**This Privacy Policy was last modified on July 11th, 2012 and was first published and made effective on July 11th, 2012.**

Welcome to Pretio Interactive ! At Pretio Interactive (“Pretio Interactive ,” “we,” or “us”), we know that you care how information about you is used and shared. This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours will be collected by Pretio Interactive when you use the Pretio Interactive Service, how the information will be used, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of information. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this policy are defined in our Terms of Use. 

Please note, though, that by its nature, your information is subject to abuse, misuse, and over-monitoring by others including, perhaps, by your friends, family, or acquaintances. Please manage your own mobile and profile privacy preferences on the Service, on an ongoing basis, accordingly. 

Pretio Interactive may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. and the use and disclosure of information about you, including Personally Identifiable Information, as described in this Privacy Policy. 

#### How We Collect and Use Information

_Personally Identifiable Information:_ We collect information that can be used to identify you as an individual (“Personally Identifiable Information”) only when you provide such information directly to us in connection with the Service. We ask for Personally Identifiable Information such as your name, e-mail address, mobile phone number and carrier when you register for a Member account with the Service, or if you correspond with us (in which case we will also retain our responses). We may also collect demographic information, such as your age, gender, preferences, and interests. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service. We may receive Personally Identifiable Information about you from third parties, including, for example, information about your transactions or relationships with various product and service providers, and your use of certain applications. For example, if you access our website or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, linking your account to the Pretio Interactive service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Pretio Interactive . This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account, any information you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to Pretio Interactive ’s website or Service. We use Personally Identifiable Information to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions and special offers. If you do not want to receive these marketing communications, you may change your preferences in your Profile page. We also use your Personally Identifiable Information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails. If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a third party to the Service, we will ask you for that person’s email address and automatically send an email invitation to the invitee. Pretio Interactive stores this information to send this email, to register the invitee if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our invitation service. Unless the invitee becomes a registered user of the Service, Pretio Interactive does not use the invitee’s email address for marketing purposes, and does not share the invitee’s email address with third parties other than Pretio Interactive ’s service providers or in the event of a corporate transaction or proceeding as described below in Sharing of Your Information. The invitee may contact us at any time to request that we remove his or her information from our database at support@PretioInteractive.com.

_Non-Personally Identifiable Information:_ We also collect and use information about your interactions with the Service in a manner and format that does not identify you as an individual (“Non-Personally Identifiable Information”). Generally, we do not combine or associate Non-Personally Identifiable Information with your Personally Identifiable Information. If we do combine Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Personally Identifiable Information, we treat the combined information as Personally Identifiable Information. We may collect, use, and disclose Non-Personally Identifiable Information as set forth below. 

_Analytics Information._ We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including the web pages you visit, your browser add-ons, your browser’s width and height, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user. 

_Cookies Information:_ When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Pretio Interactive help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. 

_Log File Information:_ Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. 

_Clear Gifs Information:_ When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No personally identifiable information from your Pretio Interactive account is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make Pretio Interactive better for our users. 

_Device Identifiers:_ When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones, iPads or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers,” such as a unique device identifier (“UDID”). Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Pretio Interactive . A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. The device identifier information that we collect does not itself collect or transmit any Personally Identifiable Information to us, however, a device identifier may be used in conjunction with other information in a manner that may constitute Personally Identifiable Information. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers are impaired or disabled. Pretio Interactive may access, collect and/or store device identifiers upon enabling FanCake’s Services. 

_Location Data:_ When you utilize the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Service. The location data that we collect does not itself contain or transmit any Personally Identifiable Information to us, however, location data may be used in conjunction with other information in a manner that may constitute Personally Identifiable Information. Some features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled. 

We use cookies, clear gifs, device identifiers, location data, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and traffic; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with certain IP addresses; (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; (h) track User Content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act; (i) serve Online Advertising (please see below) to your browser or device, and (j) automatically update the Pretio Interactive application on your system and related devices. For more information on our practices with respect to User Content that you may post to the Service, please visit our Terms of Use. 

#### How We Share Your Information

_Personally Identifiable Information:_ We will not rent or sell your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties outside Pretio Interactive and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent, except as noted below: Pretio Interactive may share your personally identifiable information with third parties solely for the purpose of providing services to you. If we do this, such third parties’ use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of Pretio Interactive (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers). Any Personal Identifiable Information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings. To change your privacy settings on the Service send an email to support@PretioInteractive.com. If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved that information. Pretio Interactive does not share your personally identifiable information or personally-identifiable location information with other, third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your express consent or unless you have opted-in to be part of a specific program or feature. We cannot control third parties’ use of your information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with such a third party, you can choose not to participate in such programs or features. We may at any time buy or sell/divest Pretio Interactive , or any combination of its products, services, assets and/or businesses. Personally Identifiable Information such as customer names and email addresses, and other user information related to the Service will likely be one of the items transferred in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions or similar transactions or proceedings. Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, Pretio Interactive will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Pretio Interactive , our Users or others. 

_Non-Personally Identifiable Information:_ We may share non-personally identifiable information obtained through tools such as cookies, log files, [device identifiers], [location data] and clear gifs (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with our third-party business partners for the purposes described in the section above on “How We Collect and Use Information.” We may also aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally identifying characteristics and may share that aggregated, anonymized data with our third party business partners.. Online Advertising. We may also share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with our business partners to deliver online advertisements (“ads”) that may be of interest to you. Pretio Interactive may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Pretio Interactive site. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on Pretio Interactive . They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, device identifiers, location data, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. Pretio Interactive does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Pretio Interactive to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The Pretio Interactive Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers for more information. 

#### How We Protect Your Information

Pretio Interactive uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Pretio Interactive and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Pretio Interactive makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from Pretio Interactive , at all times. 

#### Compromise of Information 

In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Pretio Interactive will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law. 

#### Your Choices About Your Information

_Opting Out of Collection of Non-Personally Identifiable Information:_ The only way to completely “opt out” of the collection of any information through cookies or other technology is to actively manage the settings on your browser. Please refer to your browser’s technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking/recording tools. Note that disabling cookies on your browser prevents Pretio Interactive or its business partners from tracking your browser’s activities in relation to the Service, and for use in targeted online advertising. However, doing so may disable many of the features available through the Service.

If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address.
