### Collection of your Personal Information

WMMR collects personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. WMMR also collects anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites.

There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by WMMR. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is used by WMMR for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the WMMR Web site.

Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through WMMR public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others. Note: WMMR does not read any of your private online communications.

WMMR encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from WMMR so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information. WMMR is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the WMMR and WMMR family of Web sites.

### Use of your Personal Information

WMMR collects and uses your personal information to operate the WMMR Web site and deliver the services you have requested. WMMR also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from WMMR and its affiliates. WMMR may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.

WMMR does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. WMMR may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, WMMR may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to WMMR, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

WMMR does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent.

WMMR keeps track of the Web sites and pages our customers visit within WMMR, in order to determine what WMMR services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within WMMR to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.

WMMR Web sites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on WMMR or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of WMMR; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of WMMR, or the public.

### Disclosure to Advertisers

Advertising support allows WMMR to offer many activities and services to users such as contests, sweepstakes and special events. Therefore, WMMR may also share your personal information with its Advertisers for the marketing of events, products or services of the Advertisers. When WMMR plans to share your personal information with Advertisers, you will receive such notice on the registration area of the Web site or in the rules of participation for the activity or event. However, please be informed that our Advertisers may not have the same privacy policies that WMMR does. Therefore, WMMR will ask you for your consent first to receive marketing information directly from our Advertisers in the registration area for the particular activity or event. By submitting your personal information, you agree and acknowledge that your personal information may be sent to Advertisers for marketing purposes. WMMR is not responsible for removing your personal information from third party lists or entities which you have previously authorized WMMR to share your information. You will need to contact those entities directly.

### Use of Cookies

The WMMR Web site uses "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize WMMR pages, or register with WMMR site or services, a cookie helps WMMR to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same WMMR Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the WMMR features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the WMMR services or Web sites you visit.

### Marketing Via Mobile Devices 

WMMR may provide commercial marketing and advertising opportunities, contests/sweepstakes, and alerts for news, sports, and weather delivered via mobile devices. You must subscribe to a mobile service or request that we send such information to you via a text message or a wireless voice call. Depending on the type of mobile subscription service, you will be asked to submit your name, age or date of birth, mobile telephone number, and/or standard email address. WMMR does not request submission of a wireless email address and if we collect such information inadvertently for a marketing or advertising opportunity, we will attempt to notify you and request a standard mobile telephone number that does not have a wireless domain name attached to it. You have the right to opt-out of any mobile service in the same manner in which you registered or by notifying us at [webmaster@WMMR.com](mailto:webmaster@WMMR.com).

### Security of your Personal Information

WMMR uses commercially reasonable efforts to secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. WMMR secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of industry-standard encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, WMMR cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.

### Children

WMMR does not solicit any personal information from children under the age of 13. WMMR encourages families to obtain additional information about safe use of the Internet at <http://www.ftc.gov/kidzprivacy/>.

### Changes to this Statement

WMMR will occasionally update this Privacy Statement to reflect company and customer feedback. WMMR encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how WMMR is protecting your information. Your continued use of the WMMR Web Site following the posting of any changes to this Statement constitutes acceptance of those changes.

### Contact Information

WMMR welcomes your comments regarding this Privacy Statement. If you believe that WMMR has not adhered to this Statement, please contact WMMR at[ webmaster@WMMR.com](mailto:webmaster@WMMR.com). We will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and remedy the problem.
