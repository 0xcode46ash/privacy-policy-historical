### Collection of your Information

The information we learn from visitors helps us personalize and continually improve your experience with our products and services. Station collects Personally Identifiable Information (Personal Information), which is information that by itself can be used to identify a specific individual person.  Personal Information includes things such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number.

We also collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-Personal Information) which is information that cannot by itself be used to identify a specific individual person. Non-Personal Information includes information about your computer, browser, mobile device, visits to our Site and other online activities that are used to enhance or customize your experience on our Site and to improve our Site. Non-Personal Information may be combined with other Personal Information.

Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose Personal Information or personally sensitive data through Station public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others. Note: Station does not read any of your private online communications.

Station encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from Station’s Site so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information. Station is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the Station Site.

### How We Use Information Collected

We receive and store any information you enter during account creation or any information you voluntarily provide us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain Personal Information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features.  We use the Personal Information that you provide to us for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing your experience, improving our product, and communicating with you.  Station also uses your Personal Information to inform you of other products or services available to Station and its affiliates.  Station may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.

Station collects information to assist us in delivering a superior level of product and service.  We collect information to gain a better understanding of our customers and their needs and what types of content are most popular with users, and thus provide more valuable services.  This helps us to determine how best to provide useful information to you and to understand which parts of our Site and Internet services are of most interest to you.  It enables us to give you convenient access to our products and services and focus on categories of greatest interest to you.  In addition, your Personal Information helps us keep you posted on the latest product announcements, updates, special offers, promotions, and events that you might like to hear about.  This information is also used to improve our software and services by providing personalized content recommendations, location customization, and/or personalized help and instructions. In addition, we track content accesses and downloads for the purpose of paying royalties and license fees to third party providers, such as record labels, advertisers and other copyright holders and content distributors.

### Use of Cookies and Web Beacons

Our Site passively collect certain kinds of information that reveal the frequency with which you visit our Site, the times and dates of your visits, the pages you reviewed, and other information, including an Internet protocol (IP) address, which is a series of numbers that identifies the computer you are using. Information is passively collected through various means. We use IP addresses to identify server problems, administer our Site, and compile aggregated statistics for marketing and research purposes, and to serve customized advertising or content to you based on your IP address' geographic location. We also use navigational data, including log files and click-stream data, to identify information about your web browser and operating system, and the time period in which you visit our Site or select pages or areas of our Site. This information is also used to improve our Site's content and is retained anonymously, meaning that it does not identify an individual user.

Our Site uses small text files called "cookies" that are sent to the hard drive of your computer to store bits of information related to your use of our Site. Cookies can store a variety of information, including IP addresses, navigational data, server information, data transfer times, user preferences, shopping cart information and passwords needed to access our Site. We may use cookies to serve customized advertising or content to you based on your submitted zip code, age, gender, or other demographics. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Station pages, or register with the Station Site or services, a cookie helps Station to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your Personal Information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Station Site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Station features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the features of the Station services or Site when you visit.

Our Site may also use "Web beacons" to help personalize your experience, similarly to how we use cookies. We may also use Web beacons to gather Non-Personal Information about the number of users who visit our Site, the areas in which they spend their time visiting, and other demographic data. Technology is improving every day and to improve our services’ operation and function we may introduce new technologies and monitoring techniques without advance notice or consent from you.

### Disclosure to Advertisers

Advertising support allows Station to offer many activities and services to users such as contests, sweepstakes and special events.  Therefore, Station may also share your Personal Information with its Advertisers for the marketing of events, products or services of the Advertisers.  When Station plans to share your Personal Information with Advertisers, you will receive such notice on the registration area of the Web site or in the rules of participation for the activity or event.  However, please be informed that our Advertisers may not have the same privacy policies that Station does.  Therefore, Station will ask you for your consent first to receive marketing information directly from our Advertisers in the registration area for the particular activity or event.  By submitting your Personal Information, you agree and acknowledge that your Personal Information may be sent to Advertisers for marketing purposes.  Station is not responsible for removing your Personal Information from third party lists or entities with which you have previously authorized Station to share your information.  You will need to contact those entities directly.  We and our operational service providers use cookies, web beacons and similar technology to enrich your experience on our Site by serving relevant, tailored and personalized advertising and/or content to you.  We may use the Non-Personal Information for advertising-related purposes, such as:

  * Customizing ads based on your geographic region or demographic segment or other Non-Personal Information collected about you;
  * Limiting the number of times you see a particular ad;
  * Showing ads in a particular sequence;
  * Determining when you respond to ads;
  * Reporting aggregated statistics.



We may share aggregated Non-Personal Information publicly and with our partners, such as publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share Non-Personal Information publicly to show trends about the general use of our Services.

### Marketing Via Mobile Devices

Station may provide commercial marketing and advertising opportunities, contests/sweepstakes, and alerts for news, sports, and weather delivered via mobile devices.  You must subscribe to a mobile service or request that we send such information to you via a text message or a wireless voice call.  Depending on the type of mobile subscription service, you will be asked to submit your name, age or date of birth, mobile telephone number, and/or standard email address.  Station does not request submission of a wireless email address and if we collect such information inadvertently for a marketing or advertising opportunity, we will attempt to notify you and request a standard mobile telephone number that does not have a wireless domain name attached to it.  You have the right to opt-out of any mobile service in the same manner in which you registered or by notifying us at [webmaster@wmmr.com](mailto:webmaster@wmmr.com). 

### E-Mail

We do not generally keep email correspondence, except for those emails that relate to the on-air programs or operations of Station.  As required by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), if any part of your email correspondence relates to station programming or operations, we must place such correspondence in the station’s FCC Public Inspection File, or make the correspondence available via electronic file access at the station to anyone that requests such information.  Therefore, be informed that your Personal Information contained in certain emails will be disclosed to the general public. We request that you not place any Personal Information in your email correspondence to Station that pertains to station programming or operations.  You understand and agree that we are not responsible for Personal Information that is improperly disclosed in emails that are made available to the general public in compliance with FCC regulations.

### Shopping & E-Commerce

In connection with the sale of goods and/or services or for contest prize fulfillment, we may request Sensitive Personal Information.   “Sensitive Personal Information” includes any individual’s: (1) social security number; (2) driver’s license number or state identification card number; (3) employee identification number; or (4) credit or debit card number, with or without any required security code, or PIN.   Sensitive Personal Information will only be used for verification of your identity, federal or state tax reporting requirements, and/or to implement and complete the specific activity or event it was submitted for.   We will not share your Sensitive Personal Information for marketing or promotional purposes.  The Site may also request additional Personal Information such as full name, billing and shipping address, email address and telephone number and any such information that is required to fulfill your order and to communicate with you regarding your order.  Sensitive Personal Information will be encrypted or collected though a secured Internet connection generally via SSL or S-HTTP protocols.  Sensitive Personal Information will be stored in a commercially reasonable secure manner. We may use your Personal Information (but not your credit card or debit card number) to contact you about future products, services and discounts or to provide such information indirectly from our advertisers, unless you tell us otherwise (i.e. “opt-out”).  We will only use your credit card and debit card number to complete the specific transaction you requested.  Alternatively, the Site may use a third party operational service provider to conduct the financial transaction in a secure manner; the third party payment process will be accessible via a hyperlink from the Site and the operational service provider will be solely responsible for all financial transactions and the collection, use, and storage of your Sensitive Personal Information. 

### Intended Audience

The Station Site is intended for United States audiences over the age of 13 (in some cases, over the age of 18).  All of our services are operated in accordance with the laws of the United States.  We make no representation that any service offered by Station is operated in accordance with the laws or governed by other nations.  Please be aware that any Personal Information you transfer to us will be transferred to the U.S and is subject to U.S. law.  We will reject or delete any Personal Information that we believe in good faith to be inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.

### Children’s Privacy Policy

Although persons of all ages may visit our Site and participate in activities that do not require the collection of Personal Information, we do not knowingly or intentionally collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13, and in some cases (as specified on the home page of the Site) we discourage participation by anyone under the age of 18.  Except for the limited circumstances listed below, we will automatically reject and delete the registration or entry of any person we believe in good faith to be underage.  Any false or fraudulent registration or entry from a minor will be deemed to be ineligible and will disqualify the minor from the receipt of a prize, benefit, or other participation. Except to meet FCC regulations, as required by applicable laws, or other regulatory and legal purposes, we will not use, store, or disclose any child's Personal Information to a third party without prior parental consent.

### When we Disclose Information.

Station does not use your Personal Information for purposes incompatible with those listed above.  Station does not sell or rent your Personal Information to a third party unless you consent to provide such information to a third party partner or content service.

In some cases, access to certain contests, products and services, such as products distributed by third parties, may require the provision of Personal Information to a third party, such as a sponsor, content provider or distributor.  In such cases, this will be stated during the registration process, in the terms of use, through the distribution process, or in a similar manner.  The third party’s use of such information is governed by that party’s privacy policy, and Station’s use is governed by this Privacy Policy.  Please visit the privacy policy of the content partner to make sure you understand how they use the Personal Information you provide to them.  If you do not wish for such a transfer to take place, you should not register for the applicable contest, product or service.  Additionally, Station may be required to provide specific access and usage information to certain content providers and rights holders as a condition of content licensing and royalties.  In such cases, Station may provide content usage, access, demographic and other information without your Personal Information to the content provider.

Station may disclose relevant information about our customers to our contractors (e.g. a customer service contractor or a credit card clearing service) in order for them to provide specific services for Station, and to better serve our customers. Station’s contractors are bound by strict contractual requirements to keep all Personal Information they process strictly confidential and to use such information solely on behalf of Station.  Also, Station may disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Station; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Station and its products; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Station products or the public at large.

### Links to other websites.

This Privacy Policy does not cover third party advertising or third party content that may be present on the Site.  This Site may provide banner and general advertising from third parties, in addition to other content provided by our advertisers or operational service providers.  Users may from time to time purchase goods or services offered through, or otherwise participate in or send messages concerning, such advertising, promotions or third party content offered through the Site.  Such correspondence, transactions and agreements are solely between the user and the advertiser or the third party content provider and do not involve the Site.

This Site often provides links to third party websites that could be of interest to our users, including the websites of our Advertisers.  Station does not own or control these websites and therefore, is not responsible for the content, business practices, or operations of such websites.  Third party websites linked on this Site may have different privacy policies and business practices than we do and you are encouraged to read their privacy policy first.  The presence of a link to a third party website does not constitute or imply our endorsement, recommendation, or sponsorship of the third party content, goods, or services available through, or contained on, the site. By use of this Site, you have agreed that you will use the hyperlinks to third party sites at your own risk.

### Security of your Personal Information

Station uses commercially reasonable efforts to secure your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Station secures the Personal Information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When Sensitive Personal Information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of industry-standard encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  Station will make all reasonable efforts to comply with this Privacy Policy; however, this policy should not be construed as a contractual undertaking and Station cannot warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us.  Please be aware that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and by transmitting Personal Information over the internet to us, you are accepting any risks associated with doing so.  In addition, you are responsible for taking appropriate measures to protect and secure all passwords, log-on or membership identification information and account information.

### Changes to this Statement

Station will occasionally update this Privacy Statement to reflect company and customer feedback. Station encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how Station is protecting your information.  Your continued use of the Station Web Site following the posting of any changes to this Statement constitutes acceptance of those changes.

### Contact Information

Station welcomes your comments regarding this Privacy Statement.  If you believe that Station has not adhered to this Statement, please contact Station at [PrivacyAdmin@greatermediaphiladelphia.com](mailto:PrivacyAdmin@greatermediaphiladelphia.com) or the address listed above.  We will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and remedy the problem.
