                                        Privacy Policy
Last Updated and Effective – December 31, 2015
This Privacy Policy has been updated to include a section regarding your California
privacy rights if you are a resident of California, broaden the definition of Personal
Information to include Internet Protocol (“IP”) Address and other persistent identifiers
under certain circumstances, and to add a statement in compliance with amendments to
the California Online Privacy Protection Act regarding disclosures how we will honor
browser Do Not Track settings that restrict serving targeted advertising across various
third party websites. We have not materially changed our use or disclosure of your
Personal Information.
 Privacy Policy
 The following discloses the privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) related to information
 collected from users through the Platforms owned and operated Beasley Broadcast
 Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively “Beasley,” “we”, “us”, or “our”), including,
 web properties, web pages, interactive features, iRadioNow, Apps, widgets, blogs, text
 message promotions, in addition to Twitter, Facebook or other social networking sites,
 and any other website or online service that includes an authorized link to this Privacy
 Policy, whether accessed via computer, mobile device or other technology platforms.
This Privacy Policy has been incorporated by reference into our Terms of Service
(“TOS”). Any capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy will have the same
meaning as defined in our TOS or Text Message Promotions Terms & Conditions.
 By visiting and using our Platforms, you accept the practices described in this Privacy
 Policy. If you do not want your Personal Information collected or used, please do not
 use our Platforms.
 1. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
    If you are a California resident and have an established business relationship with
Beasley and want to receive information about our online opt-out/opt-in policies of
sharing your Personal Information with affiliated or non-affiliated third parties, and how
to exercise your disclosure choices, please send your written request following the
instructions below. We will not accept requests via the telephone or facsimile.
        • For all requests, include your full name, street address, city, state and zip
             code, and the name of the Beasley Platform to which you are requesting the
             information.
        • In your email request, you must state “Your California Privacy Rights” in
             the subject line and send your email to: privacy@bbgi.com.
        • In your postal request, you must send a letter or post card to:


             Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc.
             3033 Riviera Drive, Suite 200
             Naples, FL 34103
             Attention: Your California Privacy Rights c/o Privacy Coordinator
Beasley is not responsible for responding to notices that are not labeled, or not sent
properly, or do not have complete information. Non-affiliated third parties are
independent from Beasley and if you wish to receive information about your disclosure
choices or stop communications from such third parties after we have shared your
Personal Information with them, you will need to contact those non-affiliated third parties
directly.
 2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT & HOW WE USE IT
 The Platforms may ask you to provide information that could reasonably be used to
 contact you or to identify you personally (such as your name, email address, telephone
 number, text message ID, home address, gender, birth date, your interests or other
 profile-related information (“Personal Information”). For example, Beasley will collect
 Personal Information when you register on the Platforms, request information, submit
 comments or participate in a promotion, survey or other feature of the Platforms, or
 otherwise communicate or interact with us. Beasley, for purposes of this Privacy
 Policy, includes our Operational Service Providers, who provide internal support for
 our Platforms.
        We work closely with certain third parties called Operational Service Providers
        who may perform functions on our behalf in order to carry out your requests, to
        make various features, services and materials available to you through the
        Platforms and to respond to your inquiries. Consequently, we will share your
        Personal Information with companies or individuals that host or operate our
        Platforms, analyze data or provide customer service; administer our promotions
        or provide marketing or promotional assistance (such as in connection with
        winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law, such as on a winners
        list). Third parties that process credit card payments are independent third parties
        that handle your transaction without our control or access to your Personal
        Information. These companies are solely responsible for the financial transaction
        and the collection, use, and handling of your Personal Information.
 We will also collect data that can be reasonably linked to a specific consumer,
 computer or device. For example, Beasley automatically collects your Internet protocol
 address (“IP Address”), or unique device identifiers for mobile devices (“UDID”) when
 you access our Platforms. Such information was traditionally classified as non-Personal
 Information because it did not identify a specific user. An IP Address and UDID are
 numbers or code that are automatically assigned to your computer or device,
 respectively, when you access a Platform. Our computers identify your computer or
 device by them. We will use this information to administer the Platforms, help
 diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends, track users’ web page movements


to help improve our Platforms, help identify you and your shopping preferences, song
history, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We will also use
such information to customize your experience on our Platforms by monitoring your
usage, search and transaction history and using such information to offer targeted
advertising. When IP Address or UDID are associated or linked with other Personal
Information, or used to monitor usage, search and transaction history or build a user
profile for the purposes of customizing your experience on our Platforms, such
information will be classified as Personal Information to the extent required by
applicable law.
Whenever you visit or interact with the Platforms, Beasley, as well as any third-party
Advertisers, will automatically collect non-Personal Information, such as, browser type,
device type, operating system, the preceding page views, and your use of features or
applications on the Platforms. This information helps us to improve the design and
content of our Platforms and our Advertisers use such information to measure your
interaction and interest in a particular ad.
Beasley uses the Personal Information collected about and from you for a variety of
business purposes, including internal business purposes and to: respond to your
questions and requests; provide you with access to certain areas and features of the
Platforms such as your favorite stations, your musical preferences, songs you have
listened to, shared playlists and your interaction with other users; verify your identity;
communicate with you; tailor content, provide advertisements and offers; process
applications and transactions; and for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your
Personal Information or otherwise with your consent. To the extent that you purchase a
good, service or event through the Platforms, your payment transaction will be handled
by an independent third party, such as PayPal. We do not collect, use or have any access
to your credit card data, checking or other financial account information. By submitting
your credit card and related personal information to the payment transaction provider,
you understand, acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for such
transactions. We will use contact information from the order form to fulfill your orders.
We may also combine your Personal Information with Non-Personal Information and
combine your Personal Information collected offline with that collected online, and/or
from other sources such as our Facebook, Twitter and other social network sites, our
affiliates, and Operational Service Providers.
 Cookies and Other Technology
To enhance and customize your experience with our Platforms, many of our Platforms
use cookies, pixel tags and other similar technology. If you would prefer not to accept
cookies, you can change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie,
which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; or set your browser to automatically
not accept any cookies. However, please be aware that some features and services on our
Platforms may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate
you with your Beasley account(s).


         Cookies are data files placed on a device when it is used to visit the Platforms.
         Cookies by themselves, do not tell us your email address or other Personal
         Information unless you choose to provide this information to us, by, for example,
         registering at one of our Platforms. Once you choose to furnish the Platform with
         Personal Information this information may be linked to the data stored in the
         cookie. Beasley, or our third-party Operational Service Providers, may place
         cookies or similar files on your device for security purposes, to facilitate site
         navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting our Platforms.
         Cookies allow us to collect technical and navigational information, such as
         browser type, your time spent on our Platforms and the pages you have visited.
         Cookies also allow us to improve the content and offerings on our Platforms, and
         to store certain information about you so that you do not have to complete an
         entirely new registration process each time you visit or so that you can use a
         shopping cart.
         A pixel tag is a transparent graphic image, sometimes called a web beacon or
         tracking beacon, placed on a web page to monitor the behavior and collect data
         about the visitors viewing that page. In addition, a pixel tag may tell your
         browser to get content from another server.
  The cookies and pixel tags on Beasley’s Platforms are set only by us and by companies
  with whom we work, such as our Operational Service Providers and Advertisers. We
  do not control an Advertiser’s cookies or business practices and only offer you access
  to the opt-out tools provided below. See “Our Advertising Practices” section for more
  information about the types of Advertising we provide.
 3. SHARING OF INFORMATION
Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose any of your Personal
Information to any third parties without your specific consent. We will share your
Personal Information under the following circumstances:
         •   To Beasley affiliates for business, operational, promotional and marketing
             purposes.
         •   To Advertisers if you participate in a co-branded, co-sponsored, or jointly
             presented promotion/contest, survey, voting feature, or service, and/or to serve
             personalized or targeted advertising.
         •   To our Operational Service Providers, who are prohibited from using your
             Personal Information for any purpose not authorized by us or required by law.
         •   To protect the security of our Platforms, servers, network systems, and
             databases.
         •   To protect our users, affiliates, Advertisers, and Operational Service Providers
             against liability and harm.
         •   To implement and enforce our TOS and any other legal document or contract
             related to our Services.


         •   To respond to subpoenas, judicial processes, or government requests and
             investigations.
         •   To act in response to an emergency or situation that threatens the life, health
             or security of an individual, and to assist in the investigation of a violation (or
             presumed violation) of law, or if we believe in good faith that the law requires
             or authorizes such disclosure.
         •   In connection with any proposed or actual purchase, sale, lease, merger,
             assignment, re-organization or financing of all or any portion of Beasley, our
             Platforms, Stations, or any of the business, assets or shares of our company(s)
             and affiliates.
We may also share your Personal Information as disclosed to you at the time you register,
subscribe, or use a particular Platform, or participate in an activity or feature on a Platform.
We will use, disclose and process any Non-Personal Information collected from you in
any manner and any Personal Information you make public.
 Our Advertising Practices
 Advertising supports the various free Platforms, features and activities that we provide.
 We license and/or utilize technology to serve targeted and non-targeted advertisements
 on our Platforms and within our content as that content is served across the Internet.
 Here’s a description of the types of advertising that we may provide to you, Contextual,
 First-Party, and Third-Party.
 In addition, we may also use third party ad network providers to help present
 advertisements on the Platforms, as well as third party analytics vendors to evaluate
 and provide us with information about the use of our Platforms and viewing of our
 content. For more information about how targeted Network Advertising works, please
 visit: http://www.youradchoices.com/ or
 http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising.
         •   Contextual Advertising: We may serve you an advertisement for brakes and shocks
             based on a used car dealer ad you just viewed or a search you’ve made about used
             cars on one of our Platforms; this type of relevant advertising based on particular
             content or search query is called “Contextual Advertising” because it is based on the
             context of how you used our Platforms. We do not collect any other information
             about you for Contextual Advertising.
         •   First Party Advertising: Advertising that is tailored or personalized based on a
             history of your use of content and participation in features and activities on our
             Platforms (and may be combined with information from our Facebook Fan page or
             our other social network sites) over time is based solely on a combination of
             information that Beasley or its Operational Service Providers collect from you – not
             from your use of other websites or third parties. We may share such information
             anonymously with our Advertisers in order to measure the effectiveness of ads on our
             Platforms, such as how many users opened or acted on a particular ad.


       •    Network Advertising: Information about your use of our Platforms combined with
            similar information about your overall Internet usage across different third party
            websites or online services used to serve tailored and personalized advertising is
            generally called “Network Advertising.” Multiple third party websites and online
            services are involved in this tailored or personalized advertising process, in essence a
            “network” of advertising providers. Such information about you could include
            information about your browser, computer, and/or mobile device and general
            information about your demographics (whether you have provided such information
            voluntarily or such information is estimated based on your usage history and
            interests), such as your gender, age, lifestyle, education, home ownership, geographic
            location, etc. See below for more information about how to identify a Network
            Advertising ad.
       For advertising that is part of a Network Advertising service, you should see a small
       symbol (also called an icon) attached to a banner ad or other targeted advertising on
       certain Platforms that can be clicked open for information about why and how you are
       receiving a particular ad. For more information see www.aboutads.info.
You may opt-out of third party targeted advertising served by Network Advertising
service providers in two ways: 1) By directly notifying a Network Advertising service
provider via its opt-out tools or 2) via your browser’s Do Not Track (“DNT”) settings
to indicate that you do not wish to receive targeted advertising based on your overall
internet usage. For more information about DNT and how it works, please visit the
Future of Privacy Forum’s website: http://www.allaboutdnt.com/.
Beasley will make a good faith reasonable effort to honor your DNT browser settings
for opting out of receiving targeted third party advertising based on your overall
Internet usage. Please note that various browsers frequently update technology or
change their settings and business practices without advance notice, and we may not
have the latest information on how to honor your preferences. If you exercise either
opt-out option – the cookie opt-out or the browser opt-out – you will continue to
receive advertising, but such advertising may not relate to your specific interests,
previous purchases or search history.
However, you cannot opt-out of our contextual or first party advertising, which is based
on your usage of only our Platforms and may be combined with your usage of our
social media sites. We will continue to serve you contextual and first party advertising.
We will also continue to monitor your usage and search or transaction history to
provide us with analytics on how well our Platforms, advertisements and features and
activities are functioning and used. We will also share this information in an aggregated
form (meaning that no one individual person can be identified) to our Advertisers or
potential Advertisers.
Other Advertisers on our Platforms may also use cookies or other similar technology to
determine your interest in particular products and services based on your internet
usage, search and transaction history across third party sites and will serve targeted
advertising based on such information. We control our own use of cookies and other


 technology. This Privacy Policy does not govern cookies or other technology placed by
 Advertisers.
4. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM/BY THIRD
     PARTIES
 You may choose to participate in a third party application or feature (such as
 Facebook or Twitter applications or a similar application or feature on a third party
 website) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to collect and/or
 share) information about you, including Personal Information such as lists of your
 friends, “Likes”, comments you have shared, groups and location. In addition, we
 may receive information about you if other users of a third party website give us
 access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections” or information about
 you is otherwise accessible through your profile page or similar page on a social
 networking or other third party website or interactive service.
 The Platforms may make available to you public areas such as chat rooms, forums,
 message boards, and news groups and may contain links to other sites that we do not
 own or operate whose information practices may be different from ours. This includes
 links from Advertisers that may use our logo(s) as part of a co-branding or co-
 marketing agreement. We do not control, recommend or endorse and are not
 responsible for these sites or their content, products, services or privacy policies or
 practices. These other websites may send their own cookies to your device, they may
 independently collect data or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have
 their own published privacy policies. Please remember that any information that you
 disclose in public areas becomes public information and is not subject to the
 protections and disclosure restrictions in this Privacy Policy. You should also
 independently assess the authenticity of any website which appears or claims that it is
 one of our Platforms (including those linked to through an email or social networking
 page).
 Any Personal Information submitted directly to an independent payment transaction
 provider for purchase of goods, services and events on our Platforms is governed by the
 payment provider’s terms of service and privacy policy.
 Visitors should consult all third party website privacy policies as Beasley has no control
 or responsibility over information that is submitted to, or collected by these third
 parties.
5. CHANGING, DELETING OR VERIFYING PERSONAL INFORMATION.
 If you wish to modify, verify, correct, or delete any of your Personal Information
 collected through the Platforms, you may edit your registered user information. It is not
 always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our
 databases without some residual data due to technical limitations of our systems, or
 retention and/or record keeping requirements under federal and state law. Please be


 aware that we do not control certain privacy settings and preferences maintained by
 social media partners like Facebook and Twitter. If you wish to make changes to those
 settings and preferences, you may do so by visiting the settings page of the appropriate
 social media site.
6. NOTE FOR PARENTS
The Platforms are not directed to children under 13. Beasley adheres to the Children’s
Online
Privacy Protection Act. Generally, we do not knowingly solicit, collect, use or disclose
personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age. If we determine
upon collection that a user is under this age, we will not use or maintain his/her Personal
Information without the parent/guardian’s consent, unless retaining such information is
required by statute, rule or regulation. For example, we are required by the Federal
Communications Commission to retain any correspondence received from a listener
related to our programming and operations in a public inspection file, and that would
include correspondence from a child. If we become aware that we have unknowingly
collected personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13 that does
not qualify for a legal exception, we will make reasonable efforts to delete such
information to the extent technically possible from our records.
7. UPDATES AND EFFECTIVE DATE.
From time to time we may change, modify, add or remove information on the
Platforms and/or this Privacy Policy, at any time without prior notice to you. Any
changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy
on the Platforms and we encourage you to check back from time to time.
8. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION.
Although we take appropriate and reasonable measures to help protect against the loss,
misuse, unauthorized disclosure, or alteration of your Personal Information, we cannot
guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us. If we collect sensitive
Personal Information such as credit card data, we will do so via a secured transmission
standard or protocol, or engage a third party to do so. Despite our best efforts, no
security measures are impenetrable, and transmissions or transactions over the Internet
are not 100% secure or error free. You use the Platforms and provide us with your
information at your own risk.
