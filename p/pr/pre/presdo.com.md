# Presdo | Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy

Effective date: February 21, 2011

#### 1\. Introduction

Presdo is committed to your privacy and the privacy of your information. This Privacy Policy applies to the information that users transmit to Presdo through the Presdo website at [www.presdo.com](http://www.presdo.com/) and through the Presdo Match website at [match.presdo.com](http://match.presdo.com/) (the “Sites”). This Privacy Policy informs you of what information Presdo collects from you on our Sites and how Presdo uses that information. By using or accessing Presdo, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

#### 2\. Information Collected by Presdo

When you register with Presdo, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your name, email address, photo, events from your calendar, information about your contacts on social networks, and any other personal or preference information that you choose to provide to us. When you use Presdo, you may plan meetings or events and transmit information through various channels. If you plan a meeting or event with others using the Sites, Presdo will ask you for your contacts’ email addresses.

In addition, our Presdo Match product may also collect information about your profile, such as your current and past employment positions, educational history, and any event-specific information, including your stated interests, provided to us by you or event organizers.

We consider the above information your “Personally Identifiable Information”.

When you enter the Sites, Presdo keeps track of which pages you click on. Presdo also collects your browser type and IP address. This information is collected for all Presdo visitors.

Presdo uses cookies and other standard web technology to collect information for its own use. A cookie is a small data file that the Sites transfers to your computer hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Presdo uses session ID cookies to confirm that you are logged in. You can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this convenience feature. However, refusing a cookie will hamper your navigation of our Sites.

#### 3\. Uses of the Collected Information

Presdo uses the information collected from you on its Sites to:

  * authenticate your visits;
  * administer your account and customize the service we provide to you and other users;
  * enable you to share your information and communicate with other users;
  * make recommendations about users that may interest you and other users;
  * enable other users to find you through search or browsing;
  * help you connect to third-party services to exchange information such as contacts and calendar events;
  * contact you about announcements from Presdo from time to time;
  * conduct research using the collected information to manage and improve our Site;
  * provide anonymous reporting for internal and external entities, including work with other vendors that help Presdo with data analysis, for example for product efficacy studies and market analysis



Presdo may enhance or merge Personally Identifiable Information with your other information and with data from third parties in order to better develop, market and provide our products, services and software. These third parties are all contractually obligated to keep the information Presdo provides confidential and to not use the information for any purpose other than providing services to Presdo and to you under Presdo’s direction.

When you update information, Presdo usually keeps a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information. Presdo also logs various types of information to help manage and improve the Sites, in general and for you in particular. For example, Presdo identify items such as domains and browser types to understand how the Sites is used and to report these statistics in the aggregate to the vendors that manage the technology of the Sites.

Presdo limits access to personal information about users to employees who Presdo appropriately believes need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to users or in order to do their jobs.

Presdo shall also disclose Personally Identifiable Information as permitted or required by law or as required by subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process. Presdo also shares information that it believes is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Presdo’s Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.

As Presdo’s business evolves, Presdo may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including information provided by you, in connection with a merger, reorganization or sale of some or all of our assets or in the event of bankruptcy. In any such event, Personally Identifiable Information and other information may be one of the assets transferred. Presdo will post notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy, and Presdo will seek your consent if that policy is materially different from this one.

#### 4\. Spam Policy and Phishing

Presdo does not condone spamming. Do not abuse the Sites by using them to spam, abuse, harass, or otherwise violate the User Agreement or Privacy Policy.

In addition, Presdo will not rent, sell, or share Personally Identifiable Information to any third parties for marketing purposes.

Presdo may periodically send you service-related announcements from time to time about the general operation of the service. Presdo reserves the right to send you such notices about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications.

Presdo does not and will not, at any time, request Personally Identifiable Information in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.

#### 5\. Controlling Your Personally Identifiable Information

Once you have shared your information with Presdo, you may still control how it is made available to others by taking the following the steps:

  * Review and modify your information – you can review the personal information you provided to us and make changes to the information about you that is shared with other users or to the settings for your account including your email and notification settings at any time. Much of this information is available for modification through the Sites;
  * Contact us to modify your name and contact information associated with your account – some changes to your account, such as your name and contact information, require verification before they can be made. Contact us if you would like certain information which cannot be changed through the Sites to be updated;
  * Contact us to deactivate your account – you may deactivate your account by contacting us. Once you deativate your account, your Personally Identifiable Information will no longer be visible to other users in the system. We may not retain your information and may delete any or all of your account information without liability. However, we may retain certain information contributed by you if we believe it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law.
