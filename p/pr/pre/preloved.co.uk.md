[Home](http://www.preloved.co.uk/) > Preloved Privacy Policy 

We take your privacy very seriously and are keen to ensure that you do not receive any unwelcome messages or spam as a result of your joining Preloved.

Most importantly:

  * We do not publish your email address on the web site
  * You have complete control over any emails that Preloved sends you
  * We do not share your details with any other company for marketing purposes



The policy below explains in detail how we manage your personal information:

## How we collect personal information

  * You may browse the site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.
  * In order to perform certain activities on Preloved, you must first become a member. During registration, you are required to supply your full name, a screen name (which can be just a first name or a nickname), contact information (email address and or telephone number), and your address.
  * You may also choose to provide additional personal information (for example your occupation and your hobbies) in your Public Profile. This is entirely optional and it is down to you to decide how much information you wish to make public and in what detail.
  * If you make a credit card payment to Preloved, you do so via a third party payment processing company. In this case, Preloved may store your full address and the results of any card verification checks. Preloved does not store credit card numbers.



## Disclosing your personal information

  * Preloved may publish a member's screen name, town, county and country on the site. Other details of the address (including the postcode) are not published on the site.
  * When becoming a member of Preloved, you are given the opportunity to specify whether you wish to be contacted via email or telephone in response to any adverts you publish. You must choose at least one of these methods of contact. If you choose to be contacted by telephone, your telephone number is published to other members. If you choose to be contacted by email, your email address is not published but we provide a form from which other members can send you a message. These settings can be changed by visiting the members area at <http://www.preloved.co.uk/members/>
  * Preloved may publish a member's Public Profile on the site. You can control the information contained in this profile at <http://www.preloved.co.uk/members/>

  * Preloved may at its discretion take steps to verify with third parties the accuracy of any personal information you provide.

  * We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners, advertisers or other third parties. This will not contain information that can identify any individual person.



## Newsletters and other email

  * We send all new members a welcome message via email. We also send members emails relating to the status of their account (for example when an advert needs to be renewed or their membership is about to expire).
  * At the time of joining, members are offered the opportunity to receive an email newsletter. This newsletter is published from time to time and contains news about the site, hints and tips, special offers, and other information that we feel would be of interest to our members. Members may at any time choose to no longer receive this information by visiting the members area at <http://www.preloved.co.uk/members/>, or by following the instructions contained in each email they receive.

## Viewing, changing or removing your personal information

  * Members may view all information that Preloved stores about them as an individual, by visiting the members area at <http://www.preloved.co.uk/members/>
