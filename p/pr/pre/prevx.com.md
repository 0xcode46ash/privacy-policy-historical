**PREVX HOME PRIVACY POLICY**  
_This document was last updated 15th October 2004._

As a leader in Internet Security, Prevx Limited (‘Prevx’ , ‘We’) understand your desire to protect your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains our privacy practices for Prevx’s Prevx Home software available for free download from the World Wide Web. ("Prevx Home") PREVX is committed to combating internet crime, the abuse of the internet and unauthorized intrusions into personal privacy. We believe Prevx Home is a powerful tool in this fight, providing you with protection while accessing the internet and information to help fight internet crime. The use of Prevx Home remains at all times subject to the terms and conditions set out in the PREVX Home License Agreement supplied with Prevx Home when downloaded. 

You are not required to register or supply your email address or other personal details in order to use Prevx Home. If you are already a Prevx Home user (Version 1.0) and have already registered, your personal and email details will be deleted from our database. This will not affect your ability to use Prevx Home. 

Prevx Home is provided free of charge. In return your copy of Prevx Home will report attempted intrusion events (the Attack Data) to our central database anonymously. The Attack Data is anonymous and cannot be traced to you or your PC. We do not receive or record any personal data that can or will be used to identify you or your computer. We do not require or request your email address or any other personal details to identify you or your PC. The anonymity of the Attack Data has been audited separately by Andreas Fuchsberger of FACTS Enterprise Ltd, Royal Holloway, University of London. [You can read the audit report in full by downloading this PDF](https://web.archive.org/web/20050305120239id_/http%3A//www.prevx.com/PrevxHomeAudit.pdf). These explain the details of the Attack Data and the purpose to which it is put. 

On receipt, the Attack Data is aggregated into our central database and used to produce general statistics on attacks, threats, their propagation and overall measures of the level of internet abuse and crime. We do not use it for any other purpose other than analyzing and publishing overall threat activity on the internet, researching threats, compiling statistics and to further refine and improve the performance of Prevx Home. You can view the statistics we produce and how this is used at [www.prevx.com/pathname]. PREVX compiles and supplies summary, near real time, threat statistics to commercial organizations from time to time in return for a subscription fee. If you do not wish to send your Attack Data to Prevx then simply uninstall the Prevx Home protection software. 

**Your Help**

PREVX appreciates your help in contributing to the fight against Internet crime. This fight cannot be won without the help and collaboration of the end user community. Prevx believes this is essential if the Internet is to be saved from destruction by misuse and crime. Your Attack Data will play a part in helping with the effort to combat this.
