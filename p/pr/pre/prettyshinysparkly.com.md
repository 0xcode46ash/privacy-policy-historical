# Terms, Disclosures & Policies — Pretty Shiny Sparkly

Pretty Shiny Sparkly (the “Blog”) is a fashion & style blog written, designed and edited by Kristina (the “Author”). For questions about this blog, please feel free to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact/).

## Comment Policy

  1. **Names:** Please leave a real name (first names are okay). If you must use a keyword, use “Name @ Blog Name”, for example.
  2. **Links:** Do _not include_ a link to your blog in the comment text. Your name will be linked to your blog, and CommentLuv will add your blog to the bottom of your comment. It gets redundant!
  3. **Self-Promotion:** Do not advertise your blog, blog giveaway, contest, or other irrelevant content. Please stay on topic! We all love you for it!
  4. **Be Courteous:** Be polite. No name calling, rudeness, personal attacks and similar comments will be tolerated. If you’re unsure whether your comment falls under these limitations, just remember the Golden Rule. And remember that your comment will be visible worldwide, so don’t say anything you wouldn’t want your mother to see. Your opinion is welcome, even if it isn’t favorable or positive, just keep criticism to the constructive kind only.
  5. **Spam & Ham: **Spam is filtered and deleted. Sometimes genuine comments are marked as spam (termed “ham”) and slip through the cracks. While I make every attempt to scan the spammy comments for real ones, sometimes I just don’t catch them.
  6. **Editing:** I reserve the right to edit any comment. Your comments are not copyrighted, and I may edit them for spammy characteristics (see Rule #2), spelling, or other grammatical mistakes.
  7. **Deleting:** I reserve the right to delete or unapprove a comment _for any reason_ , even other than the above stated terms.
  8. **Sole Arbiter:** I own this blog and my decision is final. I am the sole arbiter of whether a comment is libelous, hateful, hurtful, or otherwise inappropriate. This blog is my responsibility, and I take it and its contents seriously.



Users who violate this comment policy will be sent a **warning email** after the first violation. Those who continue to disregard or infringe upon the Comment Policy **will** , after two notifications, **be banned from the site**.

## Disclosure Policy

**COMPENSATION**  
One main form of financial compensation the Blog accepts is via [sponsorship](https://web.archive.org/sponsor/). The Blog does, on occasion and always with discretion, accept financial compensation for collaborations consisting of original posts written by the Author, in what may be termed an “advertorial”. Collaborations are only agreed to so long as the Author may maintain her own opinion, voice, content, and personality that her readers have come to love her by. The Blog does _not_ accept compensation for product reviews or giveaways, but may accept products. Affiliate links, which provide a commission based on sale or click number, may be used in posts without being labeled as such, however every attempt will be made to maintain transparency. All editorial content is written without prejudice or bias, regardless of sponsor or affiliate associations. The Blog does not accept compensation for product reviews.  Any advertisements, advertorials, sponsored content, and the like will be clearly marked as advertising content and do not reflect the opinions of the Blog or its Author.

**PRODUCT REVIEWS**  
In order to provide you with an accurate review on products, services, website, or various other topics, companies may provide the Author with a sample product, which the Author may choose to keep. The fact that the Author has received a complimentary item **will never influence** the content, topics or posts made on the Blog. Press samples submitted for review are For Consideration Only. The Blog and its Author do not provide any guarantee of review, positive or negative. If something doesn’t fit right, tastes funny, looks wonky, or is otherwise “not okay”, the Author will not claim it to be otherwise. The Blog and its Author may choose not to review an item, and the Author will never endorse or encourage the sale of a product that does not meet the Author’s standards or expectations. A review is nothing if it is not honest, and this is the motto the Blog and its Author stand by.

**RELATIONSHIPS**  
The Blog and its Author would like to disclose the following existing relationships. These are companies, organizations or individuals that may have a significant impact on the content of this blog. I have a personal or financial interest in the following that is or may be relevant to my blogging: ShopBop.com, Amazon.com, and all other current sponsors and affiliates.

**WARRANTY & CLAIMS  
**The views and opinions expressed on this blog are purely the Author’s own. Any product claim, statistic, quote or other representation about a product or service should be verified with the manufacturer, provider or party in question. The Author makes NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.  This Blog is provided “As Is,” without warranty of any kind, either express or implied.

## Advertising Policy

**ADVERTISEMENT/SPONSORSHIP**  
All advertising is in the form of advertisements generated by a third party ad network, or via sponsored (monthly subscription) banner advertisements provided by select few, targeted official sponsors. Those advertisements will be identified as paid advertisements, or sponsors. Some links to retailers may not be disclosed as paid insertions, however I may receive compensation for linking to them in posts. I hope that if my post convinced you to purchase a product, that you will click on the (if applicable) affiliate link I provide, to help keep this blog running!

**GIVEAWAYS**  
Please note that due to market saturation with giveaways, and the time it takes away from truly original editorial content on the Blog, giveaways will not be guaranteed to any person, company, brand, or sponsor. Furthermore, to keep with the status of the Blog and the quality of its readers, giveaways will only be considered whose total value amounts to $500 or more. Additionally, giveaways may only be hosted on PSS by official sponsors, but does not guarantee or imply the right to host a giveaway on PSS. Giveaway proposals by sponsors are reviewed on a per-item basis. Click here for more information on how you can become an [official sponsor](https://web.archive.org/sponsor/).
