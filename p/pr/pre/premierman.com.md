  | Data Protection  
  |  We will make searches about you at credit reference agencies who will supply us with credit information, as well as information from the Electoral Register. The agencies will record details of the search whether or not credit is granted. We may use credit-scoring methods to assess your application and to verify your identity. Credit searches and other information which is provided to us and/or the credit reference agencies, about you and those with whom you are linked financially may be used by J D Williams & Company Limited, our associated companies within the JD Williams group of companies ("the Group") and other third-party organisations outside the Group when credit decisions are made about you or other members of your household. This information may also be used for debt tracing and the prevention of money laundering as well as the management of your account and also for our marketing. We may also use your information, including shopping habits, to open and run your credit account including payment recovery, fraud prevention and debtor tracing and for our marketing. Unless you have previously stated otherwise, we may share your information with our associated companies within the Group and other carefully selected third party organisations outside the Group. We or they may contact you for marketing purposes by mail, telephone, electronic mail or otherwise.

If you do not wish to be contacted by third-party organisations for marketing purposes or wish to access the personal data that we hold about you or you wish to exercise any of your other statutory rights under the Data Protection Act 1998, please contact the Data Protection Compliance Officer at Griffin House, 40 Lever Street, Manchester, M60 6ES. There is a fee for subject access to your data, which is currently £10. Any statutory change in this fee will be advised to you at the point of application.

If we enter a credit agreement with you we will also supply details of your agreement with us to the credit reference agencies, as well as ongoing details of your account and how you manage it. If you do not repay on time or in full we will tell the credit reference agencies who will record details of the debt. All this information will be seen by other organisations carrying out later searches.

Information held about you by the credit reference agencies may already be linked to records relating to those with whom you are financially linked. For the purposes of credit searching you may be treated as financially linked and you will be assessed with reference to any "associated" records.

We may make periodic searches of Group records, credit reference and fraud prevention agencies to manage your account with us, to take decisions regarding credit, including whether to make credit available or to continue to extend existing credit. These searches will not be available to other lenders for credit assessment purposes.

You have the right to access your personal records held by credit and fraud agencies. We will supply their names and addresses upon request to Data Protection Compliance Officer at Griffin House, 40 Lever Street, Manchester, M60 6ES. We, the credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies may also use the records for statistical analysis about credit, insurance and fraud.

  |  Our aim is to get it right first time, and if we do make a mistake we will try to put it right promptly. If you have a query or complaint, please call our enquiry line and one of our advisors will be happy to help you; we'll do our utmost to work with you to reach a satisfactory outcome over the phone. If we can't, or we need to do some more investigation, we'll confirm receipt of your complaint within five working days and in most cases resolve the problem within four weeks.

Complex complaints can take a little longer and if this is the case, we will always let you know when to expect an answer. If together we have not reached an agreement within eight weeks, we will provide you with information about the Financial Ombudsman Service.

You can contact us at any time while your complaint is being investigated, by writing to Service Resolution Manager, Home Shopping Direct, Customer Contact Centre, 23 Hunts Bank, Manchester M3 1AX.
