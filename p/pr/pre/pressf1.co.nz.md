**Privacy Policy**

This website is a member[](http://fairfaxbm.co.nz/) of the [Fairfax Media Network](http://www.fairfaxmedia.co.nz/). [](https://web.archive.org/web/20130618014337id_/http%3A//fairfaxbm.co.nz/www.fairfaxmedia.co.nz)Fairfax Media complies strictly with New Zealand’s [Privacy Act](http://www.privacy.org.nz/privacy-act), which deals with the collection, storage, use and disclosure of personal information, and the [Unsolicited Electronic Messages Act](http://www.antispam.govt.nz/), New Zealand's "anti-spam" legislation. Fairfax Media does not monitor individual traffic patterns - only aggregate visitor behaviour is collected. It is not linked to personally identifiable information.

Most of the _Fairfax Media_ network can be accessed without disclosing personal information. Where personal information is provided to us, _Fairfax Media_ maintains and uses that information in strict conformity with the Privacy Act. Under the Act you have the right to access information about yourself and to ask for it to be corrected, and to limit the purposes for which it can be used _. Fairfax Media_ will not release your personal data without your consent.

You may request access to, and corrections to, any information we have on you by contacting the Privacy Officer, Karl Martin, by emailing[](mailto:karl.martin@fairfaxmedia.co.nz) [karl.martin@fairfaxmedia.co.nz](mailto:karl.martin@fairfaxmedia.co.nz).

_Fairfax Media_

will not share personally identifiable information with third parties unless we have your permission or we believe in good faith we are required to by law. _Fairfax Media_ occasionally uses email and subscriber lists on behalf of companies who wish to mail our subscribers. We believe direct communication can be an efficient way to present our subscribers with information relevant to them. All communication is controlled by us and companies do not have access to our subscribers' names and addresses. Any information our subscribers give us remains confidential. Where information collected on this site may be used in this way, you will be advised at the point where this information is collected and given the opportunity to decline such use then or later. **Email Newsletters**  
You will only receive email newsletters from us if you have a) expressly signed up for a newsletter on a Fairfax Media website or b) you are a subscriber to one of our publications and have been invited to sign up to an Fairfax Media email newsletter.

The information we gather from subscribers to our email newsletters (including email addresses) is not shared with our email advertisers or other parties. From time to time we may send out emails on behalf of these advertisers, but we do not provide them with access to any personal information that you have provided.

In order to provide you with better and more relevant advertising and services, we compile information about email response and website usage. When you sign up to receive a newsletter, you will be asked to provide your name and email address so that we can uniquely identify you on our database and to ensure that we can send the newsletter to you. You may also, optionally, provide us with further demographic information so that we can deliver relevant newsletters and emails to you. This information also helps us to better understand our customers' site usage patterns and also what types of content and advertising may help to encourage those visits. This information also helps us to understand the types of marketing messages our customers are interested in receiving.

All emails sent contain a link to unsubscribe or to modify your profile. You may subscribe or unsubscribe to any newsletter at any time.

 **HTML Newsletters**  
We make use of both "open-tracking" and "click-tracking" in our HTML newsletters (i.e. emails that contain text and images) but we don't link this to personally identifiable information. Open-tracking allows us to find out how many people have viewed our email newsletters and click-tracking allows us to find out which links in the newsletter were clicked on. This helps us to refine and improve the editorial content of our newsletters, and to provide you with relevant information.

"HTML-sensing" is used to determine if your email client supports HTML-based emails. This is employed only if you request our system to detect whether you can receive HTML emails.

If you have any questions, please email: 

[karl.martin@fairfaxmedia.co.nz](mailto:karl.martin@fairfaxmedia.co.nz).  
  
**Cookies**  
Cookies are small files that contain information a Web site uses for tracking purposes. _Fairfax Media_ does not typically use"cookies" but it may use them from time to time to facilitate the user experience or to enhance site content by compiling aggregate information about what specific sections and pages users visit. Cookies do not provide any personally identifiable information. They do provide details of your IP address, the computer platform and browser that you use and what domain you are accessing our site from.

They may also be used by partner and advertiser sites associated with 

_Fairfax Media_ sites. Advertisers or independent third parties who operate the servers on which the ads reside may also place cookies. Fairfax Media has contracted with DoubleClick to serve all advertising on our website(s) and through e-mail newsletters and other products. When DoubleClick is serving ads, it recognises certain types of non-personally identifiable information, such as a user's IP address, browser version or type, operating system, service provider and time zone. DoubleClick also uses cookies to note the general content of the sites that users visit over time in order to serve ads on this site and other sites. Any pages a user calls up on our Website aren't connected with personally identifiable information collected either on our website or elsewhere. For more details about the non-personally identifiable information DoubleClick collects and the opportunity to opt out of such data collection, please visit [www.google.com/doubleclick](http://www.google.com/doubleclick). We use web metric vendors to gather information to help us understand how users utilise our Website and other electronic products.

Although 

_Fairfax Media_ encourages third parties to adhere to appropriate privacy standards and policies, _Fairfax Media_ is not responsible for the actions or policies of such parties. **PressF1 Help Forum**  
Cookies are also used on the [PressF1 Help Forum](http://pressf1.co.nz/). The use of cookies on this forum is optional, but may enhance your experience of the site. Cookies are used to enable functions such as showing whether or not a thread or forum you are viewing has new posts since your last visit, or to automatically log you back in when you return to the site after being away for a while. When you register, you will be given the option to 'Automatically login when you return to the site'. This will store your username and password in a cookie, stored on your computer. If you are using a shared computer, such as in a library, school or internet café, or if you have reason to not trust any other users that might use this computer, we do not recommend that you enable this. This forum also gives you the option to use a cookie to track your current session, ensuring that you remain logged-on while browsing the site. If you choose not to store this information in a cookie, the session data will be sent through each link you click. Choosing not to use a cookie may cause problems if your computer's connection to the internet uses a proxy-server and you share links with other users behind the same proxy. If in doubt, we recommend that you select 'yes' to enable the cookie. After you have registered, you may alter your cookie options at any time by changing the settings on this page.

When you sign up to the PressF1 forum you will be asked for a username and email address. If you wish to receive emails from the Administrators, other users or receive notification of thread topics, you will need to supply a valid email address. You may create a profile that is publicly viewable, but this is entirely optional.

More information on the use of cookies in the PressF1 forum, and how to clear them is available at:

**Nielsen Online**  
Nielsen Online gathers statistical information on the visitors to our sites and our email newsletter subscribers. The information they gather provides us with non-personal statistics on the number of visitors to our websites, the pages they visited, the duration of page views, the location of visitors prior to accessing our websites, and details on browsers (including Internet Protocol 'IP' addresses or browser configurations). We use this information to help us analyse traffic patterns across our websites. All of this information is completely anonymous – you cannot be identified personally.

Random surveys may also be served to visitors to our sites. These surveys request additional demographic, non-personally identifiable information. Your participation in a survey is always voluntary, and you therefore have a choice as to whether or not to provide the requested survey information.

For more information on Nielsen Online and to opt out of cookie-setting, read the Nielsen Online Privacy and Cookie Policy:

**Online Transactions**  
Online transactions including credit card transactions on _Fairfax Media_ are secured using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). This is a standard for online transactions on the Web which provides security using digital certificates issued by Certification Authorities (companies who verify the authority of organisations before issuing them with a digital certificate). Most browsers also ship with a number of built-in certificates from major certification authorities such as Verisign or Thawte Consulting.

The certificate our server is using is issued by 

**Thawte Consulting** , who have "trusted root certificates" included in Microsoft Internet Explorer and other common browsers. This "trusted root certificate" allows your browser to be certain that our server is the same server which was issued a Secure Sockets Layer certificate by Thawte Consulting. **What security procedures are in place to protect my information?**   
Internally, _Fairfax Media_ restricts access to personally identifiable information. Only employees who need access to the information in order to do their jobs have access. These employees are limited in number, and are committed to our privacy and security policies. 

If you have any privacy concerns relating to this site, please address them to Fairfax Media's privacy officer through the 

_Fairfax Media_[ webmaster](mailto:webmaster@fairfaxbm.co.nz) **.**
