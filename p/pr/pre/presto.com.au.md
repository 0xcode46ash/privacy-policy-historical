  1. What kinds of personal information do we collect and how?



When you apply for a Presto Service** we collect personal information about you. This enables us to connect you to your Presto Service, and allows us to provide and administer that service. This information may include your name, date of birth, contact details, credit card or bank account information, personal identification numbers (PINs) and other information relevant to the provision of your Presto Service.

We may also collect your personal information from you when you use a Presto Service, enter into one of our competitions or otherwise interact with us (such as through a website, an application or through social media). This may include information such as preference information and viewing habits and other usage data.

We may also collect your personal information from third parties where you have agreed with them that your information may be disclosed.

We collect information regarding activity on our website and certain third party websites, such as the number of visitors to the website, the date and time of those visits, the number of pages viewed, navigation patterns and, where relevant, websites visited before visiting that website. On these websites, your visits are associated with cookies and/or local storage data which are unique identifiers that we use to store information about your current and previous visits. This information is collected by us or on our behalf by various website analytics companies.

When you use a Presto Service we collect information about your usage such as viewing habits as well as how you locate and watch content. This may include information on your favourite shows and channels.

If you are a Presto customer, we may link information about your viewing habits, website activity or usage with your account information.

This information provides us with statistics that we can use to analyse and improve our websites and our products and services. We may also use browsing and viewing habits data to deliver targeted marketing, advertising and content on our websites and Presto Services, as well as Presto advertising on third party sites, in each case relating to your preferences or interests.

If you log into our website you will have identified yourself. Where possible, we allow you to use a pseudonym when contributing to our website. If you wish to remain anonymous when you use our website, do not sign in to the website or provide any information which may identify you.

  1. Why do we collect the information and how do we use or disclose it?



We collect, hold, use and disclose your personal information:

a.      to assess your application for a Presto Service;

If you do not wish to receive direct marketing communications from us please contact us at [support@presto.com.au](mailto:support@presto.com.au) and/or at GPO Box 99, Sydney, NSW 2001. You can adjust your marketing preferences at any time by logging into your Presto account at [www.presto.com.au](https://www.presto.com.au/).

What happens if I don’t allow you access to my personal information for direct marketing purposes?

We will always use any personal information we have on you with a strict level of confidence. We use it to ensure that we can talk to you about ways to enhance your Presto service, how to find the content you like, tell you about new services and applications and give you access to offers that we think will help you get the most out of your Presto Service. We will also use the information to provide you access to exclusive experiences that are linked to your preferences.

  1. Who do we disclose your personal information to?



We may disclose your personal information:

a.      to entities who assist us in providing, administering, supporting, improving, promoting and marketing our products and services and our competitions, events and promotions, including suppliers, contractors, website hosting service providers, debt collectors, data storage and management companies including providers of cloud services, channel providers, and interactive advertisers;

b.      to companies that promote and market, or conduct research to help us improve and target, our products and services and

c.      where required by law, or to government and enforcement agencies or individuals appointed by a government responsible for investigating and resolving disputes or complaints concerning your Presto Service.

We may also provide your personal information to the Foxtel Partners***, who will use it for similar purposes as us. How they use your personal information is subject to their privacy policies. If you do not wish us to provide your personal information to the Foxtel Partners, please contact us at [support@presto.com.au](mailto:support@presto.com.au) and/or at GPO Box 99, Sydney, NSW 2001. You can adjust this preference at any time by logging into your Presto account at [www.presto.com.au](https://www.presto.com.au/).

When you enter into a competition we are running or participate in a sponsored event, we may seek, as a condition of entry, consent to pass your information to a promoter or sponsor of the competition or event. If we do this, we will notify you at the time of entering into the competition or event with us.

  1. Do we disclose your personal information overseas?



We may disclose your personal information to third parties overseas who provide services to us, including to our outsourced billing service providers located in the USA and the United Kingdom.

We may also disclose your personal information overseas where a partner or sponsor of a competition or event we are running is located overseas. The countries where they are located vary. If we do this, we will notify you at the time of entering into the competition or event with us.

  1. How do we handle credit information? 



In certain very limited circumstances we may be a credit provider to you. In these circumstances, the identification information we collect about you (your name, date of birth and address) is also “credit information” (as defined in the Privacy Act). We do not collect credit information from, or disclose it to, any credit reporting bodies.

We will handle your identification information that is credit information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In particular, please refer to the following sections:

  1. What kinds of personal information do we collect and how?

  1. How do we hold your personal information and keep it secure?



We hold your personal information in a combination of electronic and hard copy files. We may store your personal information with a third party data storage provider.

We may combine personal information we receive about you with other information we hold about you. This includes information received from third parties.

We take all reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we hold is protected from misuse, interference and loss, and unauthorised access, modification or disclosure by the use of various methods, including secure storage. Where we store your personal information with a third party data storage provider, we require them to keep it secure and only use or disclose it for the purpose for which it was provided.

Please contact us immediately if you become aware or have reason to believe there has been any unauthorised use of your personal information that we hold.

  1. How can you seek access to, and correction of, your personal information?



If you would like to find out what information we have about you, please contact us at [support@presto.com.au](mailto:support@presto.com.au) and/or at GPO Box 99, Sydney, NSW 2001. We will ask that you put your request for access in writing and provide us with proof of your identity. You may be charged an administration fee when we provide you with the requested information to cover our time and postage and handling or retrieval costs.

We will generally provide you with access to your personal information that we have about you, but sometimes that will not be possible, in which case we will give you a written notice explaining why.

If you think that any personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, incomplete, out-of-date or irrelevant, you may ask us to correct it. We will take reasonable steps to correct it unless we disagree with your reasons. If we refuse to correct your personal information we will give you a written explanation why.

  1. How can you access further information or complain about a breach of your privacy?



If you believe that we have breached your privacy or have any questions in relation to this Privacy Policy, you can contact us at [support@presto.com.au](mailto:support@presto.com.au) or at GPO Box 99, Sydney, NSW 2001, or write to the Foxtel Privacy Officer at PO Box 612, Moonee Ponds, Victoria, 3039.
