# Privacy Policy - Press Association

**Privacy Policy**

Your privacy is important to us. We have developed this privacy policy in order to clarify how we collect, protect and make use of your personal information as a user of our websites (each a “ **Site”** ). We operate in accordance with applicable data protection legislation, including the Data Protection Act 1998.

The Press Association Group is committed to conducting our business in accordance with this policy, in order to ensure that the confidentiality of personal information is protected and maintained.

By using the Sites and our services you are consenting to the use of your personal information as set out in this privacy policy, and cookies to be placed on your computer.

**What personal information do we collect and why?  
**  
We may collect personal information from you (such as your name, address, telephone number and email address) when you complete registration or enquiry forms or send emails to us, so that we may provide you with the services and information which you request. Please do not submit your personal information to us if you do not wish us to collect it.

If you login or subscribe to any PA Group service or product, we will use your personal information to provide you with the service or product you select, (for example, sending you password reminders or notices about the relevant service or product being suspended for emergency or routine maintenance).

If you purchase services and products from us, we may also need your name, address and payment information in order to process your transaction.

We may collect information if you choose to post information to the Sites in the form of comments or contributions to discussions. In addition, we may collect information from you, for example, in order to reply to any enquiry you make of any PA Group company or notify you of a change to our services. We may also use the information you provide for our own internal statistical purposes.

You are under no obligation to provide any such information. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services.

**Use of your personal information for marketing purposes  
**  
We may share your personal information with other companies within the PA Group, or with carefully selected partners, so that those companies can provide you with information relating to products and services we think may interest you, by letter, email, telephone or on your mobile device.

If you do not wish to receive this promotional material, you may opt-out at any time by:

  * notifying your usual contact at PA Group; or
  * sending an email to: [privacy@pressassociation.com](mailto:privacy@pressassociation.com) to tell us do you not wish to receive further promotional material; or
  * using the “unsubscribe” process described in the promotional material.



**Disclosure of personal information to third parties  
**  
We will only disclose personal information to companies within the PA Group or carefully selected and reputable third parties, unless:

  * we need to do so in order to provide you with the products or services you have selected, for example, where we use service providers to provide support services to the Sites;
  * we are obliged by law or regulation to disclose it (for example, if required by a court order);
  * we sell or buy or otherwise reorganise any of our businesses or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the reorganised entity or a prospective seller or buyer of any such business or assets;
  * a PA Group company, or substantially all of its assets, is acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it may be one of the transferred assets;
  * in order to protect the rights, property, or safety of any PA Group company, its customers, employees, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction; or
  * the information is only in the form of aggregate statistics about visitors to the Sites in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, sponsors and other third parties and for other lawful purposes, and which contain no personally identifiable information.



**Data Security  
**  
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers or in secure filing systems.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to us via the internet; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

**Links to other websites**

The Sites may contain links to other websites which are outside our control and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Please note that, if you access other websites using the links provided, the operators of these websites may collect information from you which will be used by them in accordance with their privacy policy, which may differ from ours.

**Storage of your data and international transfers**

Information that you submit via the Sites is sent to and stored on secure servers located in the UK, the Netherlands and Ireland and your information is processed in accordance with European data protection law.  However your information may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (“ **EEA** ”).  By way of example, this may happen if one or more of our servers are from time to time located in a country outside the EEA or one of our service providers or group companies is located in a country outside the EEA.  If we transfer your information outside the EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.

In addition, if you use our services while you are outside the EEA, your information may be transferred outside the EEA in order to provide you with those services.

**How to contact us  
**  
If you have any queries with regard to our data processing practices, or you wish to request a copy of any of the personal details we hold about you, please contact your usual PA Group contact or send us an email at: [privacy@pressassociation.com](mailto:privacy@pressassociation.com) or write to us at: The Data Protection Officer, Legal Department, The Press Association Limited, 292 Vauxhall Bridge Road, London SW1V 1AE.

Any request for a copy of information may be subject to a fee (currently £10) to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we may hold about you.

**Changes to the Privacy Policy and Queries**

If we make changes to this privacy policy in the future, these will be posted on this page, so please check this page from time to time.
