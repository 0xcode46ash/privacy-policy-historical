We collect and store the following information about you: the IP address or name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are coming from an America Online account, or yale.edu if you are connecting from a Yale domain): the date and time you access our site; the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to our site; and your Operating System and Browser. We use the information to measure the number of visitors to the sections of our site, which, in turn, helps us make our site more useful. The browser information is used to develop and code pages so most people will be able to view the site correctly. We also maintain information volunteered by site visitors, including but not limited to contest/sweepstakes entries; survey information, board/site registrations, additions to reviews, due date and other databases, blog registration and e-mail list membership.

SheKnows LLC collects personal information when you enter promotions or giveaways on our site/s. When you register, we ask for information such as your name, email address, due date (if applicable), gender, address, zip code and personal interests.
