# Premium Outlets: Terms of Use and Privacy Policy

Effective date: November 1, 2009.

At Premium OutletsÂ® | Simon Property Group, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner. 

As part of the normal operation of our services, we collect and, in some cases, disclose information about you. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect about you and what may happen to that information. 

#### What Information Do We Collect?

In order to use certain services provided on the site or to participate in sweepstakes or similar promotional programs, you will need to register with us. When you register, we will gather such information as your name, mailing address and email address, and demographic information, such as zip code, age, or income level. If you make a purchase, we may also ask you for your credit card information to process your order. This credit card information will not be used for any other purpose than order processing and/or referencing of your order and will not be shared with anyone outside of Premium Outlets. We may also track certain information about how you use our website. In the course of using our site, we automatically track certain information about you. This information includes the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you go to next (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. Many sites automatically collect this information.

#### A Note To Parents and Children 13 and Younger

Except as provided below, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children 13 years old or younger. Premium Outlets does not market our website to individuals under the age of 13. We require that all visitors who wish to register on our website certify that they are 13 years of age or older. If they do not certify that they are 13 years of age or older, visitors will be redirected to [Simon Property Group](http://www.simon.com/).

#### How Do We Use It? / Purpose of Use

We use your information in a number of ways. For example, we conduct internal research on our user's demographics, interests, and site usage, to better understand and service you.  


If you opt in, we may share user information with businesses affiliated with Premium Outlets. They may use this information as we would, and you may occasionally receive product and service information from them. We may also use your information to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests. In the future, we may make our email address list available to carefully screened companies whose products may be of interest to you. If you wish to unsubscribe you may do so by filling out the [unsubscribe form](https://web.archive.org/web/20150403101909id_/http%3A//www.premiumoutlets.com/vip/unsubscribe.asp) or by going to the [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/web/20150403101909id_/http%3A//www.premiumoutlets.com/contact/index.asp) page and sending an email.  


In addition, if you opt in, we may share user information with third parties that we believe are reputable in order to offer products and services that may be of interest to you.  


Finally, if you opt in, we may share user information with outside vendors and organizations that provide support services to us or that help us with our marketing programs.  


At no time will we share credit card or social security numbers in any fashion other than aggregate demographic information, or as required by law.  


Should we intend to use personal information for a purpose other than those listed above, we will announce so in advance to the relevant people, or to the public. We will not use personal information for any purpose other than the purposes mentioned above. 

#### How Do We Protect Your Information?

We use industry standard technology and efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information. These include secure servers and firewalls. All of the user data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. Only authorized employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to this information. 

#### What About "Cookies?"

A "cookie" is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive, containing information about the user. We use cookies on our site, but none of them contain any personally identifiable information. In addition, we may decide to use cookies on certain pages of our site. Cookies can help us provide information which is targeted to your interests. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our site. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted at the end of a session.  


Some of our business partners also use cookies on our site, for example, in connection with their advertising. We have no control over these cookies, and we may not have access to the information these advertisers collect. You may choose not to accept cookies by setting your browser to refuse all cookies or to notify you each time a cookie is set. If you choose to refuse cookies, however, you may not be able to use all features of our site. 

#### What About Links to Third-Party Websites?

Our site sometimes provides links to websites that are operated solely by third parties that are not under our control. This Privacy Statement applies to our site only, and is not intended to describe the privacy policies of any third party sites.
