**PREGNANCY.ORG** considers privacy a right, rather than a privilege. We will take all measures within our control to protect your privacy.

Our privacy measures include, but are not limited to: 

  * Refusal to rent and/or sell email addresses left with us. 
  * Requirements of authenticated email addresses when signing up to help us track users dedicated towards violating your privacy. 
  * Minimal use of cookies; we use only as many cookies as necessary to make surfing our site convenient. We will never knowingly or purposefully use cookies to violate your privacy. 
  * An unwillingness to accept traditional third-party banner advertisements. These advertisements often include electronic mechanisms to track you. That’s unacceptable to us so you won’t find these ads on our websites. We may advertise other URL’s within the PREGNANCY.ORG umbrella though these are controlled by us and adhere to the same privacy policy. 
  * A refusal to use advanced, non-documented tracking mechanisms including but not limited to web bugs. 

  
These measures do not include: 

  * Protecting you if you attack us. We will not tolerate attacks upon our users and/or servers. We view an attack on our server or an individual user as an attack on the whole and will respond appropriately. 
  * Information courts require us to turn over. We’ll do our best to keep them at bay but we ultimately can’t stop them. If a judge forces us to turn over information on our servers we’ll probably have to do it. 
  * Providing encrypted communications. We might eventually provide for mechanisms to access PREGNANCY.ORG via encrypted communications. We realize you may post information on this site that harms you at work (for example, an employer may decide to illegally discriminate if they see you on our TTC boards). We’ll do our best to preserve your anonymity but can’t be expected nor held liable if your participation here is intercepted. 

  
Besides that: 

  * We occasionally use third party services that have their own privacy policies. These include, but are not limited to, Bigtracker, a web stats site. Bigtracker tracks usage of PREGNANCY.ORG. They use the information they collect in aggregate. That is, they sell reports about what types of browsers, operating systems (Windows, Mac, etc…), and other technical information is being used to browse our website and many others. They never individually target nor track a user. We think their policy is reasonable but you should go over there and [check it out yourself](http://www.bigtracker.com/) if you're concerned.
  *  **Third Party Advertising** : We use [BurstMedia.com](http://www.burstmedia.com/) and other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp). 
  * **Third Party Cookies** : In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser. 

  
Finally: 

  * We realize pre-conception, pregnancy, and child raising are intensely personal experiences. We completely agree that your health and your family are nobody’s business but your own and those whom you explicitly decide to share the information with. We understand that you’ve trusted us with some of this information. We’ll do our best to live up to that trust from both a legal and an ethical perspective. 

  
And, if you're still reading: 

  * Then you obviously have an interest in Internet privacy. Therefore you should check out EPIC.ORG, the Electronic Privacy Information Center. They're located [**here**](http://www.epic.org/).
