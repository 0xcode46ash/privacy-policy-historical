## 2\. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our Services. We collect the following types of information from our customers:

**Personal Information You Provide to Us.**

We receive and store any information you enter on our Sites or provide to us in several ways. Personal Information that we collect may include things like your full name, mobile phone number, credit card and/or other payment information (if applicable), your email address and the email address of your contacts, home and business postal addresses, IP address, browser information, username, password, certain health information, and any other information or data that you provide when using our Sites and/or our Services. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as answering questions and communicating with you about the Company’s products and services, including specials and new features.

**PLEASE NOTE: By using the Services, you consent to the disclosure of your diagnosis to the other users of the Sites and the Services. We cannot control, and expressly disclaim any responsibility for, whether or how these users will subsequently use or disclose this information. If you do not consent to the disclosure of this information, you should not access or use the Sites or the Services. The Services include the ability for users to share Personal Information, including information regarding your medical condition. Any information you provide or upload to the Sites, including Personal Information about your medical condition, will be public.**  Your information will be viewable to the other users of the Sites and therefore you should only provide as much information as you feel comfortable sharing on the Sites. There may be an opportunity to speak on the phone or via video chat in a group conference call. Participation in such opportunities is not mandatory, but should you choose to participate, you should share only as much information as you feel comfortable sharing in these additional public forums.

**Personal Information Collected Automatically.**

  * We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Sites or use our Services. We automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested.
  * Generally, our Services automatically collect usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Sites and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. We only use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Sites or Services so that we can make the Sites appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those Services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Sites or Services. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use the Sites or Services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, we never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.



**E-mail Communications:**

We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from us if your computer supports this type of program. We use this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. When you receive e-mail from us, you can opt out of receiving further e-mails by following the included instructions to unsubscribe.

**What About Cookies?**

  * Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our Sites are visited and by how many people. We use cookies to enhance visitors’ experiences, to learn more about their use of the Sites and to improve quality.
  * Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Sites’ most attractive features.
  * We may serve ads on the Sites. These ads may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by the Company and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.



## 3\. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE SHARE?

Personal Information about our customers is an integral part of our business. We will not rent, sell, or share Personal Information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide the Services, when we otherwise have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

_Forums:_  We may make available your Personal Information through the Sites and/or the Services (for example, message boards, chat rooms, profile pages, bulletin boards, blogs, instant messaging, activities, polls, games and other communication forums) (each, a “Forum”) to which you post information and materials. Some of these Forums are described more specifically below. Please note that any information, text and images posted or disclosed by the user on or through such Forums becomes public information, and may be available to visitors to the Sites and other users of our Services. In addition, certain Personal Information, such as your screen name, may be available for other users to view when you make a posting to such Forums. Information regarding your activities in such Services may also be available for view by other users (for example, other users may be able to view a list of all postings you have made in all available Forums). Any postings you have made to a Forum may also be available for view by Sites users as part of a scrolling chatter functionality on certain pages of the Sites (if we enable such functionality). We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose your Personal Information, such as your illness, or any other information, through a Forum or otherwise through the Site. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE OF ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSE THROUGH A FORUM OR OTHERWISE THROUGH THE SITES.

  * _Chat Rooms:_  We may provide functionality to permit you to enter into chat rooms and communicate with other users in the chat rooms. Please note that if you use such functionality to communicate in the chat room, your screen name will be disclosed to all users in the chat room at that time. Further, if a comment you make in the chat room contains Personal Information, we cannot control how the Personal Information will be used or disclosed by the users in the chat room. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose your Personal Information, or any other information, in any comment and/or message, and to be careful about the people to whom you send such comments and/or messages. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU DISCLOSE IN SUCH CHAT ROOMS OR ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE SITE.
  * _Messaging Services:_  We may provide functionality to permit you to send messages, including instant messages, to other users through the Sites. Please note that if you use such functionality to send such a message to another user, your screen name will be disclosed to that user as well. Further, if a message you send using such functionality contains Personal Information, we cannot control how the Personal Information will be used or disclosed by the recipient of your message. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose your Personal Information, or any other information, in any message, and to be careful about the people to whom you send such messages. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU DISCLOSE IN SUCH MESSAGES.
  * _User Profiles:_  We may provide functionality to permit you to create a user profile page in which you may provide information about yourself, including, without limitation, your illness, symptoms, treatments and your feeling about your illness and/or yourself ( **“User Submissions,”**  as further defined in our Terms). You may also be able to upload pictures, videos and stories to your profile page as part of the User Submissions. User Submissions may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Sites. Email addresses are used to add new User Submissions to user profiles and to communicate through User Submissions. Users’ email addresses will not be directly revealed to other users by us, except when the user is “connected” to another user via a shared group membership, or an invitation, or if the user has chosen to include their email address in their User Profile. Please note that any User Submissions you make, including Personal Information, on or through your profile page may be available for other users, the Company, administration, moderators and other staff to view and other users may be able to post comments on your profile page.



_Communication in Response to User Submissions:_  As part of the Sites and Services, you will receive from us email and other communication relating to your User Submissions. You acknowledge and agree that by posting such User Submissions, we may send you email and other communication that it determines in its sole discretion relate to your User Submissions.

_Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:_  We anticipate that we may become affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses may sell items to you through the Sites. In other situations, we may provide services, or sell products, jointly with affiliated businesses. You can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, and we will share your Personal Information that is related to such transactions with that affiliated business.

_Agents:_  We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information for the above purposes.

_Promotional Offers:_  We may send offers to you on behalf of other businesses. However, when we do so, we do not give the other business your name and address. If you do not wish to receive these offers, please send an email with your request to hello@preventnow.com.

_Business Transfers:_  In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information, including Personal Information about customers, is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if the Company, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that the Company goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, Personal Information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of the Company may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.

_Protection of the Company and Others:_  We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of the Company, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

_With Your Consent:_  Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.
