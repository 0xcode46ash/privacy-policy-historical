# Privacy Policy

**PI WORLDWIDE  
PRODUCT USER PRIVACY POLICY**   


This Product User Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the manner in which Praendex Incorporated, doing business as PI Worldwide (“PI Worldwide” or “we”), handles personal information collected in connection with the administration of its Predictive Index® proprietary management tool (the “Predictive Index” or “PI”), the Selling Skills Assessment Tool (the “SSAT”) and related management and sales training. This includes personal information collected by the administration of The Predictive Index Organization Survey Checklist (“PI Survey”) or the SSAT via web application, a local desktop application, or paper form. In this Policy, the term ‘personal information’ means information that identifies, or can be used to identify, an individual.

This Policy can be accessed from PI Worldwide’s home page, piworldwide.com, as well as from accesspi.piwebservices.com, ssatsurvey.com and picampus.com. This Policy does not describe PI Worldwide’s information collection practices with respect to its general corporate websites located at piworldwide.com and ssatsurvey.com. In this Policy, the term “Customer” means PI Worldwide’s corporate customers, and the term “User” means employees and prospective employees of Customers.

 _Background_  
PI Worldwide and its distributors provide Predictive Index-related services to Customers to help them align individual performance with specific business goals. The Predictive Index process is a combination of assessment, education and consulting. At the core of that process is the PI Survey, an assessment tool that provides insight into the natural workplace behaviors of employees and prospective employees, giving management valuable insights for coaching, leadership development, succession planning, employee selection, team performance and more. Normally, Customers administer the PI Survey to their Users. Users generally take the PI Survey online, via the accessPI web application, although Users may also take the PI Survey through a local desktop application, or by completing printed versions of the PI Survey. The educational component of the Predictive Index process involves training conducted by PI Worldwide and its distributors. Upon completion of the Predictive Index® Management Workshop, trainees (hereinafter “PI Analysts”) have received the necessary training to interpret and apply the Predictive Index. Whether the PI Survey is completed through the accessPI web application, a local desktop application or on paper, PI Worldwide’s software provides Customers with the results of the PI Survey, along with a basic report, which needs to be interpreted by a trained PI Analyst. In addition, PI Worldwide directly and through its distributors, provides consulting services to Customers to allow them to maximize the usefulness of the Predictive Index process.

PI Worldwide and its distributors also provide its Selling Skills Assessment Tool (SSAT) to Customers. The SSAT, available in over 20 industry- or job-specific editions, is an online survey of 25 targeted, scenario-based questions, which provides management with a detailed quantification of the selling skills possessed across their organization. The results provide Customers with sales force data, group data and individual data. Users have access to their own SSAT results and to a general comparative analysis of the SSAT results of the group of Customer employees in which they fall; Users do not have direct access to the SSAT results of any other User. In addition, PI Worldwide directly and through its distributors, provides sales training services to Customers to allow them to focus their sales training initiative for maximum impact.

 _Safe Harbor_  
PI Worldwide has certified its compliance with the standards of the Safe Harbor Principles established by the U.S. Department of Commerce for the regulation of data transfers between the European Union and the United States. This Product User Privacy Policy and PI Worldwide’s information handling practices described herein comply with the Safe Harbor privacy principles. _Notice_  
PI Worldwide will inform Users about the purposes for which it collects information about them, how to contact PI Worldwide with inquiries or complaints, the types of third parties to whom PI Worldwide discloses personal information, and the choices and means PI Worldwide offers Users for limiting use and disclosure of personal information. This notice is provided by means of this Policy, which is made available to Users before personal information is obtained from them. _Choice_ The Safe Harbor privacy principles require that PI Worldwide provide Users with the right to opt out as to whether personal information is disclosed to a third party (other than a third party acting as PI Worldwide’s agent), or used for a purpose that is incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the User. As PI Worldwide does not disclose personal information except to its agents (as described in the “Onward Transfer” section below) or to the Customer for the benefit of whom the User provided the information, and PI Worldwide does not use personal information for incompatible purposes, there are no activities for which an opt-out is applicable. _Notice: What Personal Information Does PI Worldwide Collect, and How Do We Use It?_ _ _PI Survey__  
When a PI Survey is administered via the accessPI web application or is otherwise entered into the accessPI web application, PI Worldwide collects only the following personal information about Users, which is used solely for the purpose of administering the Predictive Index, generating reports of the results, providing the results to the Customer, and interpreting the results for the Customer:

• Responses to the PI Survey. The responses consist of the User’s reaction to a list of adjectives.

In addition, Customers who use the _access_ PI online portal may optionally request and store other information from their Users including job code, department code, occupation, or other information. PI Worldwide does not make use of such information except in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

PI Worldwide does not collect or use any other personal information in connection with administration of the Predictive Index. For example, and without limitation, we do not collect or use the User’s address, date of birth, age, sex, race, religion, or any sensitive information such as health-related or politics-related information.
