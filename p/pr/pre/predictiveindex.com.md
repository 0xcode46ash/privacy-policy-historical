# Privacy Policy | The Predictive Index

               

This Privacy Policy is in two sections: for users of our products and services and for visitors to our website.

Users of our Products & Services

               

                   
  1. **Purpose and Notice**   
The purpose of this Policy is to provide Notice to users as to the purposes for which The Predictive Index collects information about them. It also describes the manner in which The Predictive Index handles personal information collected in connection with the administration of the Predictive Index® (the “Predictive Index” or “PI®”) as well as other products and services. In this Policy, the term “personal information” means information that identifies, or can be used to identify, an individual. This Policy provides Notice to all users and is available before personal information is obtained from them.
                   
  2. **The Information we collect**   
Respondents to the PI® are asked to provide the following information: first and last name and email address. They are also asked to provide responses to the PI (which consists of adjectives chosen by the respondent). Additionally, Customers who use accessPI™ may optionally request and store other information from their users and respondents including job code, department code, occupation, status, language, or other information. The Predictive Index does not make use of such information except in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you voluntarily provide this information, you are considered to have provided your consent by opting in to the collection and use of this information as described in this Privacy Policy. In addition to the personal information collected when the user completes the Predictive Index, other information may be collected when other The Predictive Index products are used or when a user agrees to answer optional research questions. In this case, the information requested may include the following: customer-provided group designation, age, years of experience, ethnicity, gender, country of origin, education level, position level, company name, relationship to The Predictive Index, title, and occupation. The Predictive Index may collect technical information about the user’s browser and operating system in order to enhance the user’s experience. The Predictive Index and its distributors collect additional personal information from PI Analysts and employees of Customers who attend sales training. This information includes address, telephone and fax numbers. We do not collect information from children. Since our assessment tool is designed to be used only by adults age 18 and older, it is not intended for nor used by children.
                   
  3. **The purpose for collecting this information**   
The Predictive Index may collect, store and use aggregated anonymous information from the administration of the PI and its other products and services in order to improve its business operations and its products. This information does not identify any individual. The Predictive Index also uses log files and other generally available web tracking technologies in operating, maintaining, and improving its accessPI™ and other websites. This information does not contain any personal information and is not linked to any personal information that The Predictive Index holds. The Predictive Index’s software provides Customers with the results of the PI Survey, along with a basic report. The Predictive Index and its distributors also provide other assessment tools and collect information in connection with these other tools.
                   
  4. **We keep your information private and secure**   
The Predictive Index maintains appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to ensure the security of personal information covered by this Policy and to protect such personal information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. The Predictive Index has a written data security policy that describes the policies and procedures by which we and our employees maintain data security. The Predictive Index does not sell or rent any personal information to any third party. We do not disclose any personal information to any other party except to fulfill the purposes for which the information was disclosed. To fulfill those purposes, The Predictive Index discloses personal information as follows:  
                                                   
    * To the Customer and its employees who administer or order the PI, SSAT, ISAT, or other assessment or use the e-learning system;
                           
    * To employees of The Predictive Index, our distributors, and their employees and subcontractors for the purposes of database management, administration, customer support, and assistance in interpreting assessment results;
                           
    * To subcontractors of The Predictive Index who develop and manage our hardware, software and communications infrastructure; and
                           
    * To third party software systems used by the Customer
                                                  
                        The Predictive Index maintains contracts with our subcontractors requiring them to comply with the requirements of this Policy. These third parties must provide at least the same level of privacy protection as the Safe Harbor Principles require.                     
                   
  5. **Safe Harbor Certification**   
The Predictive Index complies with the U.S – EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.  The Predictive Index has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.  To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view The Predictive Index’s certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/                           
                        Click here to access the Safe Harbor List record of Predictive Index, LLC, dba The Predictive Index. Should the URL change, our record can always be located by searching the Safe Harbor List under the company name of Predictive Index, LLC. The Safe Harbor privacy principles require that The Predictive Index provide users with choice which is the right to opt out as to whether personal information is disclosed to a third party, other than the following: agents, third party software systems, or the Customer. We  do not disclose personal information except to our agents or to third party software systems used by the Customer or The Predictive Index or to the Customer for the benefit of whom the user provided the information. The Predictive Index uses personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected. A basic principle of Safe Harbor certification is data integrity. The Predictive Index processes personal information only in such a manner that is compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the user. The Predictive Index takes all reasonable steps to ensure that data is reliable for its intended use and is accurate, complete, and current. Another principle of Safe Harbor is annual review and verification. The Predictive Index conducts an annual self-assessment to verify that this Policy is accurate, comprehensive, prominently displayed, completely implemented, accessible and conforms to the Safe Harbor principles and that employee training and appropriate compliance procedures are in place.
