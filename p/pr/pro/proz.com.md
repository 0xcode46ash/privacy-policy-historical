### Information submitted by users

Some ProZ.com services require registration. In order to register with ProZ.com, a user must provide a valid email address, a user name, and a password. Registered users have the option to provide various other personal information, such as contact details and professional qualifications, for display in a profile page and elsewhere on ProZ.com. All of this information is optional and can be modified by the individual at any time. ProZ.com may combine individuals' profile information with information from other ProZ.com services or third parties in order to provide users with a better experience and to improve the quality of ProZ.com services. 

Some ProZ.com services, such as job postings, do not require registration, but still require the user to submit contact information. This information can be hidden from public view, but may be used by ProZ.com or its agents to contact the job poster in the event of a dispute or other problem. 

ProZ.com provides a number of other services to help individuals and companies connect and collaborate with one another, such as forums, member directory, the KudoZ term help network, article knowledge base, etc. Any personal information a user chooses to post to such a service may be read, collected, or used by others who access these services, and may be used to send them unsolicited messages. ProZ.com is not responsible for the personal information users choose to post in these services. However, users are able to update or remove the content of these posts, either via an interface provided for that purpose or with the assistance of ProZ.com staff. 

When a product or service is purchased from ProZ.com, credit card or other payment account information is requested. ProZ.com encrypts this sensitive information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). ProZ.com may store this information, in which case it will be maintained in encrypted form on secure servers. 

Some ProZ.com services allow users to submit personal information about third parties. For example, the ProZ.com invoicing tool allows users to submit client contact information, such as email and postal address, for the purpose of preparing and sending invoices. The Blue Board allows users to submit client contact information for the purpose of maintaining a directory of language job outsourcers along with individual service providers' willingness to work with them again. The project history feature allows users to submit information about past projects and clients, for the purpose of maintaining a sample portfolio of past work. Third party personal information will only be used for the purpose for which it was collected.

### Cookies

ProZ.com may set and access one or more cookies (a small text file containing a string of characters) on users' computers. Cookies are used to improve the quality of ProZ.com's service, including for storing user preferences, identifying user logins, and tracking user trends. ProZ.com links the information stored in cookies to your ProZ.com profile and to personal information you submit while on this site. 

ProZ.com uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. Session cookies are used to make it easier for you to navigate the site. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies are used to identify you, so you don't have to enter your username and password more than once if you so choose. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. 

ProZ.com uses third-party web analytics software or services, such as Google Analytics or Crazy Egg, to analyze website traffic in order to improve the site. These web analytics services may set a cookie to collect anonymous traffic data. 

ProZ.com uses third party advertisements. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on ProZ.com, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including a visitor's IP address, ISP, web browser, and in some cases, whether Flash is installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites). Google uses the DoubleClick DART cookie on publisher websites displaying AdSense for content ads. Users may opt out of the use of DART cookies and any other cookies used by Google Ads. ProZ.com has no access to or control over these cookies. For more information on privacy policies and available opt-out options applicable to Google Ads, see the [Google Advertising and Privacy FAQs](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html "http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html") and the [Google Ad and Content Network Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_cookies.html "http://www.google.com/privacy_cookies.html"). 

Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personal information. 

### Third party platforms

Periodically ProZ.com will use a third party platform and service such as WebEx or Gotowebinar for the delivery of webinars, virtual conferences, and some online training. When using these services it is often required to provide a valid email address for registration. In some instances, such as free webinars, and virtual conferences, the registration email address you provide on this third party platform may be shared with the vendor providing the free webinar, or sponsors and exhibitors of the online conferences. In these instances a clear indication on the registration page will be made informing users that the email they provide on these registration pages may be shared with the vendor in question. If you provide information during registration on a third party site or service used by ProZ.com, you grant ProZ.com permission to share the information you have provided during registration for this event with that service or site partner. Information you provide during registration at ProZ.com will not be shared, only that information which you provide during registration on the third party platforms registration page will be shared. Their use of your information is subject to their privacy policies. 

### Log information

Like most websites, ProZ.com servers automatically record information sent by visitors' browsers. These server logs may include information such as the web request, Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of the request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify the browser. This automatically collected data is linked to ProZ.com profiles and to personal information. IP addresses are tied to personal information in order to protect users from fraud, abuse, and other misconduct, and to improve the quality of ProZ.com services. 

### User communications

When users send email or other communications to ProZ.com, those communications may be retained in order to process inquiries, respond to requests and improve ProZ.com services. 

### Surveys and contests

From time-to-time ProZ.com may request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving ProZ.com services. 

### Referrals and user testimonials

Individuals may elect to inform friends or colleagues about ProZ.com content using a "tell-a-friend" feature. When using this feature, ProZ.com requests the name and email address of the friend. ProZ.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending the friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the ProZ.com website. The friend may contact ProZ.com to request the removal of this information from its database. 

In some cases, users may also recommend a trusted colleague as a candidate for certain ProZ.com programs (such as the Certified Pro Network). When using this referral service, ProZ.com may collect the colleague's name and contact details, as well as information about the colleague's professional qualifications. ProZ.com uses this information to invite the colleague to participate in the specified program. The colleague may contact ProZ.com to request the removal of this information from its database. 

From time-to-time ProZ.com may post a list of select users and testimonials on its website that contain information such as names, titles, and company logos. ProZ.com obtains the consent of each user prior to posting any information on such a list or posting testimonials. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at privacy@proz.com. 

### Social media widgets

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. 

### Children

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. ProZ.com never collects or maintains information from those actually known to be under 13, and no part of the ProZ.com website is structured to attract anyone under 13. 

### Communications from ProZ.com

ProZ.com may use individuals' personal information to contact them. For example, to respond to comments or requests for information, to provide requested services, or in regard to issues relating to users' accounts, via email or telephone. 

Registered users can sign up to receive various service email notifications, such as alerts about job postings in a particular specialty, or new forum posts on a given topic. These service notifications are opt-in, and can be completely controlled by the user, following instructions at the bottom of each notification message. 

In addition, an email newsletter is periodically sent to registered users, and from time-to-time service announcement updates are sent to those who may be affected. ProZ.com may also send marketing or promotional materials for its own services or on behalf of third parties. These messages will include clear and effective instructions for opting out of future communications of that kind. 

### Processing personal information and user data

ProZ.com only processes personal information and user data for the purposes described in this privacy policy. In addition to the above, such purposes include: 

  * Providing services to users; 
  * Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve ProZ.com services; 
  * Ensuring the technical functioning of ProZ.com's network; and 
  * Developing new services. 



ProZ.com processes personal information on its servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, personal information may be processed on a server outside a user's own country. 

Individuals have full control over the personal information they provide to ProZ.com and the manner in which it is used. 

If ProZ.com proposes to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this privacy policy, an effective way will be provided to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. ProZ.com will not collect or use sensitive information (confidential medical information, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs or sexuality, tied to personal information) for purposes other than those described in this privacy policy without first obtaining the individuals' prior consent. 

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but can be reset to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some ProZ.com features and services may not function properly if cookies are disabled. 

ProZ.com may show advertisements using Google's AdSense service. Google uses the DoubleClick DART cookie for these ads. Users may opt out of the use of DART cookies and any other cookies used by Google Ads. For more information on privacy policies and available opt-out options applicable to Google Ads, see the [Google Advertising and Privacy FAQs](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html "http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html") and the [Google Ad and Content Network Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_cookies.html "http://www.google.com/privacy_cookies.html"). 

ProZ.com may use third-party web analytics services to track trends in the way the site is used, in order to improve the site. Users can opt out of having their information shared with these third-party analytics services on the [analytics preferences page](http://www.proz.com/privacy-settings "http://www.proz.com/privacy-settings") . 

Users can decline to submit personal information to any ProZ.com services, in which case ProZ.com may not be able to provide those services to them. 

ProZ.com does not share, sell, rent, or trade personal information with third parties for their promotional purposes.

ProZ.com shares personal information with third parties outside of ProZ.com only in the following limited circumstances: 

  * Users have given their consent. Opt-in consent is required for the sharing of any sensitive personal information. 
  * Third-party web analytics software or services may be used which send information about a visitor to the third-party provider, for the purpose of creating anonymous, aggregate statistics about website traffic. Such information may include the visitor's IP address, ISP, and web browser details. Users can choose to opt out of having their information shared with these third-party analytics services [on this page](http://www.proz.com/privacy-settings "http://www.proz.com/privacy-settings"). 
  * A third-party advertising service may be used which includes cookies that send the advertiser information such as the visitor's IP address, as described in the "Cookies" section above. Users can choose to opt out of these cookies, as described above. 
  * Such information is provided to ProZ.com subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on ProZ.com's behalf. For example, ProZ.com uses payment processors such as PayPal to bill you for goods and services, email service providers such as MagnetMail to send out emails on our behalf, and chat service providers such as BoldChat to faciliate live online support chats. ProZ.com shares email address, contact information, and payment details as necessary for the third party to provide that service. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personal information for any other purposes. ProZ.com requires that these parties process such information based on ProZ.com's instructions and in compliance with this privacy policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. 
  * ProZ.com has a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of ProZ.com, its users or the public as required or permitted by law. 



If ProZ.com becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, notice will be provided before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 

ProZ.com may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of jobs passed in a particular language pair, for example, or how many visitors have accessed a user's profile page. Such information does not identify anyone individually. 

When you visit the profile page of a ProZ.com member, a log of your visit may be disclosed to that member. This visitor log includes your IP address, along with your ProZ.com account type (if you are logged in), and the search terms that led you to the profile if you arrived there via a search engine. 

In addition, ProZ.com users may create custom profile pages with dynamic content ("dynamic profile content"), including javascript, iframes, or CSS. When you access a profile page that ProZ.com has identified as containing dynamic content, you will be prompted whether to allow the dynamic content to run in your web browser. If you choose to allow the dynamic content to run, and if the dynamic content has been configured to do so, the profile holder may have access to certain personal information provided by your web browser, such as your IP address or cookies. Please note that ProZ.com does not screen or approve dynamic profile content and cannot control how such profile holders use any personal information that they may obtain in connection with dynamic profile content. You can report any suspected misuse of information to ProZ.com and the claim will be investigated and appropriate action taken against the profile holder, up to and including terminating their participation at ProZ.com and/or other formal legal action. 

ProZ.com takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where personal data is stored. 

Access to personal information is restricted to ProZ.com employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve ProZ.com services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. 

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, its absolute security cannot be guaranteed. If you have any questions about security on our site, you can contact ProZ.com staff at privacy@proz.com. 

ProZ.com processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual, and in accordance with this privacy policy. ProZ.com reviews its data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that it only collects, stores and processes the personal information needed to provide or improve ProZ.com services. Reasonable steps are taken to ensure that the personal information ProZ.com processes is accurate, complete, and current, but it depends on ProZ.com users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary. 

ProZ.com makes good faith efforts to provide users of its services with access to their personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at their request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. ProZ.com asks individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated, or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where ProZ.com provides information access and correction, this service is performed free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. 

If your personal information changes or if you no longer wish to use any ProZ.com services, you may update your information from your [profile updater](https://web.archive.org/settings) page or deactivate your account from the [unsubscribe](https://web.archive.org/unsubscribe) page. Alternately, you can request assistance from ProZ.com staff by submitting a support request, sending an email to privacy _@_ proz.com, or contacting the ProZ.com office by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. You will receive a response to your request to access within 30 days.

ProZ.com regularly reviews its compliance with this privacy policy. Please direct any questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy or ProZ.com's treatment of personal information to the ProZ.com IT/Security Manager by [submitting a support request](http://www.proz.com/support?mode=ask&type=privacy "http://www.proz.com/support") through the support center on this website, or by writing to: 

ProZ.com  
PO Box 903  
Syracuse, NY 13201 USA 

ProZ.com will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal information in accordance with the principles contained in this privacy policy. 

Please note that this privacy policy may change from time to time. Individuals' rights under this privacy policy will not be reduced without their explicit consent, and most such changes are expected to be minor. Regardless, any privacy policy changes will be posted on this page and, if the changes are significant, a more prominent notice will be provided (for example, on the ProZ.com home page, or by email notification) prior to the change becoming effective. Each version of this privacy policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and prior versions of this privacy policy will be kept in an archive for review.
