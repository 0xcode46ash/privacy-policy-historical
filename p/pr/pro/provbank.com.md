Provident Bank's Online Privacy Policy

At Provident, we are responsive to our customers’ needs. 

One way to achieve this is to obtain customer information in order to provide superior quality products and service to best meet their needs. Our customers’ needs are important to us. However, we are also aware of the customer’s expectation of privacy, including the personal information that you provide to us on-line. Protecting this information is something we take very seriously. Therefore, whenever we handle a customer’s personal information, we adhere to the following policy:

  * We keep information accurate, secure, and confidential. We share personal customer information only with our subsidiaries, from time to time, in accordance with both legal and confidential policies.


  * All Bank employees adhere to these confidentiality standards.


  * We do not share personal information with third parties except if one or more of the following occurred: (1) where the customer consents to disclosure; (2) where we are legally required to do so; (3) where we have consented to provide customer information by contract; and (4) where the customer has been informed about the Bank sharing of information and the customer has been given the opportunity to decline.


  * Customers may notify us if they believe that any of their personal information is inaccurate. We can be contacted at 1-800-962-9644 or within the Baltimore area, 410-281-7111 or email us at feedback@provbank.com and we will gladly accommodate your request.



Information regarding our customers is used in the normal course of our business in order to deliver premium customer service and to offer products tailored to the customers’ needs. As our technologies and resources change, we will continue to evaluate and modify, as necessary, our policies on safeguarding customer information.
