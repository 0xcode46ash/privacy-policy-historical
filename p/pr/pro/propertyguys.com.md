### What Personal Information We Collect

Such information is provided to us by the customer and is used for the marketing of a property, the identification of a property for a potential buyer, or the promotion of our home marketing services or to third party advertisers such as mortgage brokers or real estate agents.

### How we Use, and to whom we disclose your Personal Information

PropertyGuys.com does not sell any information collected about our customers. PropertyGuys.com only discloses personal information on a strictly confidential basis. We use your Personal Information to:

  1. Provide you with timely and reliable services and do all things necessary to administer those services; and
  2. Develop and maintain our relationship with you and communicate with you.



We disclose your personal information to our Head Office and or industry associates affiliated with our system to complete transactions or service requests initiated by you the customer. We disclose this information to our advertisers or affiliates, and receive the information back from them for the services we provide to them for invoicing purposes.

Additionally, we may share personal information with third parties engaged to assist us in providing services to you or to carry out one or more of the purposes described above. These other service providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than to provide this assistance and are required to protect personal information disclosed by us and to comply with the general privacy principles described in this Privacy Statement.

We may also disclose your personal information to third parties, such as those described above, as may be required to carry out the requested services. We disclose your personal information to such parties on an "as needed" basis only.

We reserve the right to disclose personal information to a third party if a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order legally requires or authorizes us to do so.

We ensure that access or alteration to personal information is limited to those individuals who have a valid business reason to access the information.
