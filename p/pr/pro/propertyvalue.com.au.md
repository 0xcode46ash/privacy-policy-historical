# Privacy policy - PropertyValue

We collect, use and disclose personal information in accordance with state and federal privacy legislation as it relates to us. 

This privacy policy has been created in order to disclose the information gathering and dissemination practices for this website, www.propertyvalue.com.au. We will not sell, share or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. This policy is in addition to the Terms & Conditions governing the website and should be read in conjunction with those Terms & Conditions. 

**Information Collection and Use**  
There are two kinds of information that websites can obtain about you - Aggregate Information and Personally Identifiable Information. Aggregate Information is anonymous data that websites use to analyse trends, administer the website, diagnose problems on the site's servers, track user movement, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use and to help improve the quality of the web pages. It may be your domain name or your IP address. None of this information is connected with Personally Identifiable Information. Personally Identifiable Information is any information that can personally identify you. 

**Collection of Personal Information**  
Personally Identifiable Information about visitors to our site is collected only when knowingly and voluntarily submitted. If you have checked the yes box to the statement **_"Please advise me of special offers and new products/services that may interest me. This may include third party offerings"_** , on the registration page, your personal information may be shared with third parties. In addition we may share personal information with the government suppliers of our data or with a joint venture partner or affiliate where our service is marketed through that partner or affiliate. Our site provides users with the opportunity at any time to opt-out of receiving communications from us and our partners on the PropertyValue registration page. 

**Information Disclosure**  
Personal information may be disclosed in special situations where PropertyValue has reason to believe that doing so is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against anyone damaging, injuring, or interfering (intentionally or unintentionally) with PropertyValue's rights, property, users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. Also, PropertyValue may reveal information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. 

**Deleting or Modifying Personal Information**  
If you have given us personally identifiable information in the past and then have second thoughts or would like to update it, click on the 'Update' link on the top right hand side of the website. You can then make any required changes and submit your new details by clicking on the 'Update Profile' button. If you have previously given us permission to forward your information to third parties (as we mentioned above) and we have already passed it on, we cannot delete or change that information. At your request, we will inform you how to contact those third parties that hold information relevant to you. 

**Cookies**  
Cookies, which are industry standard and used by most websites, including www.propertyvalue.com.au, can facilitate a user's ongoing access to and use of a site. There are two types of cookies - stored cookies and session cookies. A stored cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. PropertyValue stored cookies are used to track your visits and make it easier for you to log in and view all your purchasing details such as shopping cart and special discounts as soon as you enter our site. They also allow us to track usage patterns and to compile data that can help us improve our content. If you do not want to be remembered by our site via stored cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allow you to deny cookies being stored on your hard drive. A session cookie is an identification key exchanged between the web server and your browser each time you request a page from a website. This is the only reliable method for the website to positively identify you as the current user. Session cookies are alive only for the duration of your browser session and are NOT kept on your hard drive. Please do not set your browser to reject all cookies or specifically turn off session cookies as you won't be able to log in and purchase any reports from our site. 

**Security**  
PropertyValue takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When you submit personal information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. All credit card data, including card number, expiry date and the card holder's name are not retained after the transaction has been processed and cleared. In addition, all e-commerce transactions are carried out using a real time, automatic payment gateway. We also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the personal information mentioned above, is restricted within our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific task are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment. 

**Is Online Shopping Safe?**  
Shopping conducted through reputable online retailers is as safe as giving your credit card to retailers over the telephone, or using a credit card in a store or restaurant. The negligible difference between the numbers is striking, says market research firm BAIGlobal Vice-President, Andrew Davidson. "You are no more likely to experience fraud if you shop online than if you shop anywhere else," he says. "â€¦It is all about perception." (The Age, June 26, 2001) 

If the site is secure, your web browser will display a special icon - a closed padlock or an unbroken key on the bottom of your screen - to show that a merchant has a secure transaction system. As well, the address of the web page will begin with "https" instead of the usual "http". This indicates that your credit card data is transmitted using encryption technology. 

PropertyValue has a secure transaction system. Our 128-bit Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure online commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, as the information travels over the Internet. 

As always when using passwords, keep them safe and don't share them with other people. 

**Still don't want to use your credit card on the Internet?**  
Unfortunately we do not have a telephone or fax ordering service at present however this may change if customer demand warrants such a facility. We would appreciate you contacting us at admin@propertyvalue.com.au with your feedback if you really would like to purchase some property reports however are not prepared to use our online payment system. Whilst we cannot implement such a system immediately, this will allow us to gauge customer demand and provide alternative payment options in the future, if appropriate.
