### Data Collection

  * **Coupon Comments —** You are by no means obligated to share any personal information on this website. However, there is one area where, if you like, you may comment on a coupon offer. In order to make your comment seem more personal and easier to reply to you are asked to enter a user name and a state of residence to go along with your comment. You are not required to enter a name or place and if you choose to leave these fields blank your comment will still be posted anonymously. However, should you choose to enter this information PromotionalCodes.com assures you that neither your name nor location will be shared with any other parties.
  * **Cookies —** Our site's visitors should know that PromotionalCodes.com uses cookies to recognize the computers used to gain access to our site. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored via a user's web browser. We use cookies in an effort to simplify our internet transactions and make your experience with our site more personalized. In some cases, the user must click on the "Get Coupon" button to view the coupon ode or activate the discount; this is when the cookie drop occurs.

  * **Website Redirects —** It is also important for users to note that PromotionalCodes.com features links to various other retailer websites.
