**EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework Participation for EU C **lient Engagement Data****

Protiviti Inc. in the U.S. (the "Protiviti US") participates in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (the "Framework").  Protiviti US’s participation in the Framework applies to personal data received in the U.S. from the European Union (EU) about our corporate clients' personnel, customers and vendors (collectively, "EU Client Engagement Data").  We are committed to subjecting such EU Client Engagement Data to the Framework, including its Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability to the extent applicable to Protiviti US as a processor acting on behalf of our corporate clients. To learn more about the Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's Privacy Shield List [here](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome). 

EU Client Engagement Data Collection, Use, and Disclosure

We operate as a processor acting on behalf of our corporate clients regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of EU Client Engagement Data and we process EU Client Engagement Data that our corporate clients submit to our services in accordance with their instructions. If you are an employee at, or customer or vendor of, our corporate clients, please consult the privacy policies of that entity for information about its privacy practices.

Rights of EU Data Subjects under the Framework

If you are an EU data subject, you have the right to access your own EU Client Engagement Data subject to certain limitations, such as where the legitimate rights of other persons would be infringed or where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate.   Please note that because Protiviti US personnel may have limited ability to access EU Client Engagement Data our clients provide to us as part of our services, if you wish to request access, to limit use, or to limit disclosure, please contact us as described below and provide the name of the corporate client who submitted your data to us. We will refer your request to that corporate client, and will support them as needed in responding to your request.

Choices of EU Data Subjects

We operate as a processor acting on behalf of our corporate clients and, as such, do not use or disclose EU Client Engagement Data in a manner that is subject to choice requirements under the Framework.

Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability under the Framework

Please contact us as specified below if you have any questions, need access to your EU Client Engagement Data, or otherwise need assistance.  We remain responsible for our collection, use and disclosure of EU Client Engagement Data in accordance with the Framework.  We also are responsible for third party agents that are processing EU Client Engagement Data on our behalf, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.  In certain situations, we may be required to disclose EU Client Engagement Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements.

If you have an unresolved concern about EU Client Engagement Data that we have not addressed satisfactorily, we have committed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU Data Protection Authorities to serve as our independent dispute resolution body for the Framework.  We are also subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission with respect to the Framework.  In addition, under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website (available [here](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome)), EU residents may invoke binding arbitration for non-monetary issues when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

Contact Us

Please contact us here [Privacy-Shield@Protiviti.com](mailto:Privacy-Shield@Protiviti.com) if you have any questions, wish to exercise your rights of access, or seek other assistance related to our participation in the Framework as described above.  

This Policy is effective as of September 28, 2016. If you have any questions about our website privacy policies, please contact us at:
