This privacy policy which includes a statement regarding our usage of cookies applies to your use of the online information services provided by Daft Media Limited t/a Daft.ie (“Daft”) on daft.ie, rent.ie, let.ie and/or property.ie (“the Sites”). This service allows advertisers to display properties they are marketing for sale or rent and allows users of the Sites to search for and/or access details of properties that are available for sale or rent. We are not estate agents. Daft Media Ltd, ("Daft"), has offices in Latin Hall, Golden Lane, Dublin 8. Our Company Registration Number is 347856\. 

##  What our Privacy Policy Covers 

This Privacy Policy sets out how Daft collects, uses and protects any personal information the Sites obtain from you when you use one or all of our Sites. This policy does not cover the practices of companies that Daft does not own or control, or the actions of people that Daft does not employ or manage. Daft may modify or repost this Privacy Policy at any time and any such modifications or replacements shall be effective immediately upon the posting of the modification or replacement Privacy Policy on the Sites. You agree to visit the Sites on a regular basis to review this Privacy Policy so as to become aware of any such modifications or amendments. By using one or any of the Sites, you agree to the terms of our policy and any modifications and/or amendments thereto. 

##  Introduction 

At Daft, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how and for what purposes we use the information collected about you via the Sites. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using the Sites and any services we offer via the Sites, you are agreeing to be bound by this Policy in respect of the information collected about you via the Sites. If you have any queries or comments about the policy or our use of your personal information, please get in touch with us by emailing us at [supportdesk@daft.ie](mailto:supportdesk@daft.ie) or writing to The Privacy Department at Latin Hall, Golden Lane, Dublin 8. 

In general, we use the information we collect about you to:   
\- improve the features and services we offer   
\- help our members provide more personalised services to you   
\- support our own marketing and promotion efforts. 

**Personal information collected:**

When you visit, register or use the services on the Sites, you may be asked to provide certain information about yourself, including your name and your contact details. We may also collect information about how you use the Sites including your IP address, your searches, the times and date of Site access, the properties you look at, agents or developers you contact, the contents of the emails you send to them and any other information that you may upload to the Sites. Finally, we may also collect information from any correspondence that you have with us **.**

##  Information collection and use 

Your information will enable us to provide you with access to all parts of the Sites and to supply the services and features that you have requested. We may aggregate the information to identify patterns which we can use in our marketing and to help us develop, administer, support and improve our services and features. If you have consented to being so contacted, we may use your information to contact you for your views on our services and to notify you occasionally about important changes or developments to the Sites or our services. Where you have consented, we might also use your information to email you with details about any other products or services which we offer which may be of interest to you. If you change your mind about being contacted in the future, please email us at [supportdesk@daft.ie](mailto:supportdesk@daft.ie) and tell us. The following features, by their nature, require and make use of personally identifiable information. 

**Sending emails**   
The information that you complete on the 'Email Advertiser' forms on the Sites is recorded by us and is sent to the advertiser that you wish to contact. This helps the advertiser provide you with a more personalised service.   
**Email a Friend**   
When you use the 'email a friend' feature of the Sites we record which properties you have sent to the friend, solely so that we can track the popularity of those properties. We record the other details provided in the email for internal monitoring of the service. We will not add any information collected in this manner to our mailing lists to protect you and the recipient's privacy.   
**Registering with us**   
You do not need to register with us to visit our Sites. If you do register with us, we save the details you provide and use them to enable us to personalise the service we offer to you. You can update your details at any time via the Sites or by emailing us at [supportdesk@daft.ie](mailto:supportdesk@daft.ie). 

##  Who has access to the information you provide or we collect? 

We retain access to all personal information that we have collected from you. If you have consented on signup or on the appropriate email form, we may provide any of the information we collect to carefully screened third parties to contact you regarding products or services that we think may be of interest to you. If you change your mind about being contacted by these third parties in the future, please email us at [supportdesk@daft.ie](mailto:supportdesk@daft.ie) and tell us that you would like to opt out of any such contact. If Daft enters into a joint venture with or is sold to or merged with another business entity, your information may be disclosed to our new business partners or owners. 

We use third party analytics services to help understand your use of our services. Google Analytics combines information from Google's interest-based advertising or 3rd-party audience data to provide approximate demographic information. 

We will not otherwise disclose, sell or distribute your personally identifiable information to any third party without your permission unless we are required to do so by law. 

##  Access to, changing or removing the information we hold 

Registered users of the Sites can update their information or change their settings only by emailing [supportdesk@daft.ie](mailto:supportdesk@daft.ie). Registered users can cancel their membership by contacting [supportdesk@daft.ie](mailto:supportdesk@daft.ie). Non- registered and registered users of the Sites can request we provide them with a copy of the personally identifiable information we hold via [supportdesk@daft.ie](mailto:supportdesk@daft.ie) . You may ask us to make any necessary changes to ensure that such information is accurate and kept up-to-date. 

##  Cookies and tracking 

Like many websites, Daft uses "cookies" to enable us to personalise your visits to the Sites, simplify the signing-in procedure, keep track of your preferences and to track the usage of the websites. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored in the hard drive of your computer by your browser. Your browser will have the option to prevent websites using cookies (your browser's help screen or manual will tell you how to do this), but please note that this may reduce the functionality of the Sites and other websites. Like all websites, our servers automatically record 'log files' containing information about the volume and characteristics of our website traffic e.g. IP address, numbers of pages viewed, length of time spent on site. We use log files to build pictures of how our sites are used that help us to monitor and improve the service. We cannot identify you from your log files. 

Here is a list of all the cookies that we set and how we use them: 

Cookie  |  Content  |  Usage  |  expiry

We also use third party advertisements on the Sites to support our sites. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our sites, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for retargeting purposes (showing France property adverts to someone in Paris, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites). 

**DoubleClick DART cookies**

We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google's DoubleClick ad server, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests ("interest based targeting"). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). DART uses "non-personally identifiable information". It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting http://www.doubleclick.com/ privacy/dart_adserving.aspx 

**Security, storage and transfer of information**

We follow strict security procedures to ensure that your personal information is not damaged, destroyed, or disclosed to a third party without your permission (unless they are providing services as outlined in the 'who has access to your information' section above) and to prevent unauthorised access to it. The computers that store the information are kept in a secure facility with restricted physical access and we use secure firewalls and other measures to restrict electronic access. If we are working with third parties we will require them to have in place similar measures to protect your information. All of the information we collect or record is restricted to our offices. We will explicitly ask you when we need information to identify you. We may require you to co-operate with our security checks before we disclose information to you. You can update the personal information that you give us at any time by viewing your details page. We will retain your information for a reasonable period or for as long as is required by law. 

##  Anti-Spam Policy 

This Anti-Spam Policy Notice governs the use of the Sites at and its associated services, web pages, domains and sub-domains, which are owned and operated by Daft. The Sites should not be used as a database for direct marketing by phone or SMS messaging or email or by any other form of electronic mail. The personal contact details contained in the placements on the sites are for the sole purpose of letting or selling a property and should not be used for any other purpose. The sending of unsolicited direct marketing electronic mail or the making of unsolicited marketing phone calls is in certain circumstances prohibited by law and may give rise to fines and/or other penalties. 

We consider spamming to be any activity which includes you directly or indirectly transmitting electronic mail to any person that has not solicited such electronic mail and does not consent to such transmission. We also consider as spamming the posting of advertisements that are off topic, or in the discussion forum. We reserve the right to terminate your account if we deem you to be in violation of our anti-spamming policies. We also reserve the right to suspend your account pending review upon receipt of any complaint or other evidence that you may be engaging in any spamming activity. If you are "spammed" by any products, services, website, or any other matters, please report this activity to [supportdesk@daft.ie](mailto:supportdesk@daft.ie)

**Anonymous and aggregated data**

Daft may aggregate data in an anonymous manner for disclosure to advertisers or business associates for promotion and marketing purposes. By way of example, we may disclose to an advertiser the number of unique visitors to Daft or the percentage age groups of our members. In such an event we undertake to ensure that no such data could be used to personally identify you. 

**Sale of the Company**

Daft reserves the right to transfer information including personal data to a third party in the event of its sale, merger, liquidation, receivership or transfer of all or substantially all of its assets provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Statement and provided that the third party only uses your Personal Data for the purpose that you have provided it to us. You will be notified in the event of any such transfer and you will be afforded an opportunity to opt out.
