|  • I've checked a proxy list. Some of proxies support http/https protocol. But in the Service Manager they are only shown as http.

HTTP(HTTPS) in the type column means that this proxy server supports HTTP and HTTPS, but the current supported protocol is HTTP. So you need to change this proxy server type from HTTP to HTTPS by clicking the "Modify" button in the proxy list. If you need to use this proxy server with all supported types (HTTP, HTTPS), you need to add this server to the proxy list twice with different server types.
