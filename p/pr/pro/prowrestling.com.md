Respond directly to the child's request on a one-time basis and not use that information to re-contact the child for other purposes. 

Request the name or online contact information of a parent for the purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing parental notification. 

Respond more than once directly to a specific request from a child (such as in the case where a child requests a newsletter subscription) and not used to re-contact the child for other purposes. We will use our best efforts to provide parental notification, which will include the nature and intended use as well as an opportunity for the parent to prevent the use of the information and participation in the activity. 

We will NOT entice the child to divulge more information than is needed to participate in any activity, game, or service. 

We will provide the parent a description of the specific types of a personally identifiable information collected from their child upon request. We will allow the parent to refuse further use or future online collection of personally identifiable information and provide a way for a parent to obtain any personally identifiable information collected from their child. 

We will provide notice to children in age appropriate terms of what personally identifiable information is to be collected. 

We will NOT provide any links to Web sites that are unsuitable for children. 

We will encourage children to get their parent's permission before sharing personal information online.
