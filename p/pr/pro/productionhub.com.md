Welcome to ProductionHUB.com, By using our services, you agree to abide by the terms of this Member/Visitor Agreement; PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY. 1\. Provisions for Equipment Broker The products that appear on ProductionHUB.com are for informational purposes only. Despite our efforts to provide useful and accurate information, errors may appear from time to time. Before purchasing goods or services you've read about on ProductionHUB.com, you should confirm with the vendor any information, including the price, that is important to your purchasing decision. ProductionHUB.com is not responsible for, and does not guarantee the performance of, any such goods or services. 

ProductionHUB.com's Equipment Broker is a service that brings buyers and sellers together. Information about a particular piece of equipment is supplied by the seller, not by ProductionHUB.com. The price and other terms of any sale remain subject to direct negotiation between the buyer and the seller. Though we hope that all who come to ProductionHUB.com will act honorably and treat each other fairly, we can't verify the information they supply or guarantee the equipment they offer. When using this service to find a buyer for your equipment or equipment you may want to purchase, we urge you to use the same common sense and good judgment you would in selling goods through, or responding to, a classified ad in the newspaper. 

Those who offer equipment for sale through ProductionHUB.com should be prepared to sell the equipment they advertise at the price(s) at which, and the terms of which, they advertise them. To list any equipment for sale on ProductionHUB.com, sellers are required to provide certain identifying and contact information. The information must accurately identify the seller and the method of contact must permit buyers to communicate directly with the seller without any alteration to the content of their communications. ProductionHUB.com reserves the right to deny use of this service to anyone who does not comply with these requirements or who otherwise uses the service in manner we consider inappropriate. 

ProductionHUB.com respects the privacy of its users. Please take time to review our privacy policy. 

We invite you to bring to our attention any information you believe to be inaccurate. Please respond to 

[info@productionhub.com](mailto:info@productionhub.com), along with an explanation of your objection. 

For your convenience, ProductionHUB.com has listed a variety of links to other websites, not operated by ProductionHUB.com, where you can obtain information on specific equipment manufacturers and their products. While ProductionHUB.com encourages you to consult such websites, ProductionHUB.com cannot guarantee nor be responsible for the prices, terms, quality, reliability or performance of the products or services provided by these vendors.

By continuing to use this service following such changes, you agree to be bound by this agreement, as modified.
