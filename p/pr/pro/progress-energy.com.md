# Privacy Statement - Progress Energy

|  |  | 

_Last updated Dec. 20, 2010_

Progress Energy understands your concerns about the use of your personal information online and is committed to maintaining high standards for the protection of your privacy.  This notice explains Progress Energy's online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

**How Progress Energy Protects Your Personal Information**

Progress Energy uses industry-standard encryption technologies to secure and protect your personal information.  As an added level of security, several online forms on this Website utilize Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") when transmitting and receiving data.  SSL helps prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintains data accuracy and ensures the appropriate use of information.  SSL works by using a private key to encrypt data before it is transmitted over an Internet connection.  Both Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator support SSL.  Unfortunately, no security system is fail-safe, and Progress Energy cannot guarantee the information you provide will never be obtained by unauthorized persons.

To protect information off-line, access to the information you provide is limited to those employees who specifically need it to conduct their business responsibilities.  Your information is stored on secure servers protected inside controlled facilities.

**Why We Collect Information**

In general, you are not required to register or provide personally identifiable information in order to view much of this Website.  Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Statement, we limit the collection of personally identifiable information to what is needed to administer accounts, provide customer service, offer products and services and process online employment applications.  For example, if you choose to use online customer services, including account access, e-bill and product or service enrollment, you will be asked to provide personally identifiable information, which may include your account number, name, mailing address, telephone number and e-mail address.  You may be asked to submit additional personal or financial information in order to use certain specific services offered in these customer account transaction areas.  If you choose not to provide this information, we may not be able to provide you with the requested service or complete your transaction.

**Ways We Use Information:**

  1. _Personal Information:  
_The personal information that you provide to us enables you to use various customer services offered on this Website.  We may use this information to fulfill your request, respond to an inquiry that you send via this Website or to keep you informed about Progress Energy and its products and services.  If you do not wish to be contacted by us for these purposes, or you believe you are receiving our communications in error or no longer want to receive them, you may "opt out" at any time by informing Progress Energy that you wish to have your e-mail address deleted from Progress Energy's distribution lists.  You can do this by logging into your account on this Website and updating your preferences.  You can also fill out an online feedback form by clicking [here](http://progress-energy.com/shared/contactus/index.asp). If you choose to communicate with Progress Energy or its subsidiaries through an online feedback form, then e-mail from Progress Energy or its subsidiaries will be considered to be sent with your consent and will be accessible to anyone who has access to your e-mail.

Access by Progress Energy and its subsidiary employees or consultants to any personal information you provide is limited to only that which is necessary to provide the service(s) offered and to otherwise allow such employees or consultants to conduct their business responsibilities.  Progress Energy may use the personal information you supply to notify you about important news concerning our company, including new products and services, product updates and technical support issues and special offers we think you may be interested in.

You should protect the confidentiality of your customer account number, e-mail address and password.  You are responsible for all activity on this Website accessed by your e-mail address and password.  The information provided through Online Account Access is intended solely for the private use of the customer.  Any unauthorized entry of Online Account Access or unauthorized use including copying or other reproduction of the information is prohibited.

  2. _Information Sharing:  
_Progress Energy and its subsidiaries do not sell, rent or lease to others your personally identifiable information without your consent.  Absent your consent, Progress Energy will share the personal data you provide only with other Progress Energy subsidiaries and affiliates and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf.  In addition, we may make information available to third-parties and/or service providers who are providing the product(s), service(s) or information you requested.  For example, we may share billing and collection information about you for a home appliance warranty service with the third-party providing such service if we bill you for this service as part of the monthly statement that you receive from us.
  3. _Anonymous Audience Traffic Analysis:  
_In the process of administering this Website, Progress Energy maintains and tracks usage through Web server logs.  Web server logs provide such information as what types of browsers are accessing our site, what pages receive high traffic and the times of day our servers experience significant load.  This information is used to improve the content and navigation features of our site.  It is not used to personally identify you.

  
  
**Consent**

Progress Energy and its subsidiaries will use and share the personally identifiable information you provide to us only for the purposes described above.  We reserve the right to disclose any and all pertinent customer information in our possession if we are required to do so by federal or state law, subpoena or court order, or as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary.

**Energy Audits/Surveys**

Any energy audit or survey that is performed using this Website and any recommendations that you may receive using this Website will be based on methods and algorithms that are commonly used in the energy industry.  However, the quality of the output from any energy audit or survey and any advice or recommendations that may be provided will depend on the quality and accuracy of the information that you supply.  You must also understand that every situation is unique, and we cannot guarantee that all relevant factors have been considered in providing you with any recommendations.  Other factors that may affect your energy costs include weather, your lifestyle, the orientation of your building, etc.

We are not recommending one product or company over another and cannot guarantee the performance of, nor shall we be responsible in any way for, any product or service that you may decide to purchase or install or any building improvements that you may decide to make.  While we may give you one or more options or recommendations from which to choose, the ultimate decision to purchase or install such products and make such building improvements will be yours.  We do not guarantee that you will realize any energy or other cost savings even if all recommendations are implemented.
