_Last updated March 19, 2011_

Progress Energy Service Company, LLC, the service company subsidiary of Progress Energy, Inc. (Progress Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries referred to herein, individually and collectively, as “Progress Energy”) understands your concerns about the use of your information online and is committed to maintaining high standards for the protection of your privacy. This privacy statement applies to [www.progress-energy.com](https://web.archive.org/index.page?) (the website), and explains Progress Energy’s online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

**Information We Collect**

_Information You Give Us ****_

We collect information that you voluntarily provide to us, such as during transactions, customer service, surveys, and online registrations. For example, if you choose to use online customer services, including account access, e-bill and product or service enrollment, you will be asked to provide personal information. Personal information is information that identifies you specifically, and may include your account number, name, mailing address, telephone number and e-mail address. You may be asked to submit additional personal or financial information in order to use certain specific services offered in customer account transaction areas. If you choose not to provide this information, we may not be able to provide you with the requested service or complete your transaction.

_Automated Information Collection_

We receive and store certain types of information when you interact with our website, e-mails, and online advertising. Our purpose is to allow the website to work correctly, to evaluate use of the website, and to support website analytics and marketing campaigns. Some examples include:

  * We may collect technical information such as your internet protocol address or similar identifiers, your computer’s operating system and browser type, the address of a referring website, if any, and the path you take through our Web pages.
  * We use “cookies” to recognize you as you use or return to our website. This is done so that we can provide a continuous and more personalized experience for you. A cookie is a small text file that a website or e-mail may save to your browser and store on your hard drive.



**Ways We Use Information**

We use your information to provide requested services and to support core business functions. For example, we may use your information to:

  * Fulfill your requests for products and services and communicate with you about those requests.
  * Register and service your account.
  * Administer surveys.
  * Provide customer service.
  * Improve the content of our website for your reference.
  * Alert you to updated information and services.
  * Protect the security or integrity of our websites and our business.
  * Answer your questions.



_Information Sharing_

Progress Energy does not sell, rent or lease to others your personal information without your consent. Absent your consent, Progress Energy, Inc. will share your personal information only with other Progress Energy subsidiaries and affiliates (unless prohibited by law or regulation) and/or service providers that help with our business operations. For example, we may share your customer information with third parties performing computer-related services, credit card processing, electronic bill payment services, or debt collection purposes (in the event of your account default) for Progress Energy (but never your password).

_Aggregate Information_

We may share aggregate and statistical data that does not identify you personally. We may do this for research and marketing purposes.

_Legal Requirements_

Progress Energy will use and share your personal information only for the purposes described above. We reserve the right to disclose any and all pertinent information about you in our possession if we are required to do so by federal or state law, subpoena or court order, or as we, in good faith, believe is legally necessary.  
 **  
Communications from Us**

You will receive e-mail communications from us when you sign up for an account online, perform an online transaction (such as paying your bill, requesting a new password, etc.) or opt in to receive marketing e-mails from us. If you have opted to receive marketing e-mails, we may contact you via e-mail about new products and services. To opt out of receiving these marketing e-mails, please log into your online account and edit your profile.  

**How Progress Energy Protects Your Personal Information**

Progress Energy uses industry-standard practices to secure and protect your information. As an added level of security, several online forms on this website utilize Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) when transmitting and receiving data. SSL helps prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintains data accuracy and ensures the appropriate use of information. SSL works by using a private key to encrypt data before it is transmitted over an Internet connection. Most Internet browsers support SSL. Unfortunately, no security system is fail-safe, and Progress Energy cannot guarantee the information you provide will never be obtained by unauthorized persons. You should protect the confidentiality of your information such as your customer account number, e-mail address and password. 

**Business Transfers**

In the event that Progress Energy experiences a business transition, such as a merger or acquisition, or selling a portion of its assets, personal information will, in most instances, transfer as part of the assets.
