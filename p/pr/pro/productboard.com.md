## ProductBoard Privacy Policy

Effective as of March 8, 2017, ProductBoard, Inc., ("ProductBoard") and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "ProductBoard Group" or "we" or "us" or "our") have updated our Privacy Policy ("Policy"). 

For a prior version of our Privacy Policy, click [here](https://legal.productboard.com/privacy_policy_2014_07_01). 

#### 1\. Introduction

This Policy details our commitment to protecting the privacy of individuals who visit our Websites (as herein defined) ("Website Visitors"), who register to use our Services,or who attend or register to attend sponsored events or other events at which the ProductBoard Group participates ("Attendees"). For the purposes of this Policy, the term, "Websites", shall refer collectively to www.productboard.com as well as the other websites that the ProductBoard Group operates and that link to this Policy and the term "Services"shall refer to our on-demand product management platform, tools and services made available from the Websites. "Subscriber" shall refer to an individual or an entity that has agreed to a Service Agreement for use of our Services. 

#### 2\. Scope Of This Policy

In this Policy, personal information means information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his/her physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity. 

Personal information does not include "Usage Data" which we define as encoded or anonymized information or aggregated data we collect about a group or category of services, features or users which does not contain personally identifying information. Usage Data helps us understand trends in usage of the Service so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor the Service. In addition to collecting and using Usage Data ourselves, we may share Usage Data with third parties, including our customers, partners and service providers, for various purposes, including to help us better understand our customers’’ needs and improve the Service as well as for advertising and marketing purposes. We do not share Usage Data with third parties in a way that would enable them to identify you personally. 

Our Websites may contain links to other websites and the information practices and the content of such other websites are governed by the privacy statements of such other websites. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any such other websites to understand their information practices. 

If you have purchased a subscription to our Services additional terms relating to data rights are set forth in and governed by our Terms of Service, available here: <https://legal.productboard.com/terms>, or such other applicable agreement between you and any member of the ProductBoard Group relating to your access to and use of such Services ("Service Agreement"). 

Subscribers to our Services are solely responsible for establishing policies for and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as any and all privacy policies, agreements or other obligations, relating to the collection of personal information in connection with the use of our Services by individuals with whom our Subscribers interact. If you are an individual who interacts with a Subscriber using our Services, then you will be directed to contact our Subscriber for assistance with any requests or questions relating to your personal information. 

We collect information under the direction of our Subscribers, and have no direct relationship with individuals whose personal information we process in connection with the use of our Services. If you are an individual who interacts with a Subscriber using our Services (such as a customer of one of our Subscribers) and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Subscribers that use our Services, please contact the Subscriber that you interact with directly. 

We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our Services to Subscribers. Transfers to subsequent third parties for these purposes are governed by the Service Agreements with our Subscribers.

We and our authorized partners use cookies and other information gathering technologies for a variety of purposes. These technologies may provide us with personal information, information about devices and networks you utilize to access our Websites, and other information regarding your interactions with our Websites. 

We partner with third parties to either display advertising on the Websites or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on our Websites and other sites in order to suggest advertisements based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking here (or if located in the European Union click here). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads and you will continue to receive generic ads. 

Web beacons, tags and scripts may be used on our Websites or in email or other electronic communications we send to you. These assist us in delivering cookies, counting visits to our Websites, understanding usage and campaign effectiveness and determining whether an email has been opened and acted upon. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by our third-party service providers on an individual and aggregated basis. 

We use Local Storage Objects ("LSOs") such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.
