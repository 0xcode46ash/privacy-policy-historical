 **1\. What personal information of yours is collected?**

Personal information of yours that we may collect and store includes, but is not limited to, first and last name; home, billing or other physical address (including street name, name of a city or town, state, postal code); email address; telephone number; fax number; credit card information; IP address; bidding activity; shipment activity; returns activity; URL referral data; support communications including email and telephone logs; site search activities; wish list; website usage; any other identifier that permits PropertyRoom.com to make physical or online contact with you; and any information PropertyRoom.com collects online from you and maintains in association with your account, such as your PropertyRoom.com username and PropertyRoom.com password.

Personal information is collected from you when you voluntarily register for membership services with PropertyRoom.com. These services include receiving electronic newsletters, purchasing items, and entering contests and participating in other opportunities provided by PropertyRoom.com. We also collect email addresses from anyone who sends us mail or request technical or other help. This information enables PropertyRoom.com to improve its site to make your online visits more productive and enjoyable.

Information about your activities on our web pages (such as the pages you access most frequently or the search terms you enter) is collected by tracking Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the web. The computers that deliver the Web pages to you automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from our site, our server logs your IP address.

 **2\. Who is collecting your personal information?**

Unless specifically stated otherwise, when you share personal information through our website, you are sharing that information only with PropertyRoom.com, its related service providers, and, if applicable, the third party vendor providing the purchased item.

On occasion, services and products on the PropertyRoom.com website may be offered in conjunction with another company. For example, after making a purchase on our website, you may be directed to a webpage that allows you to sign up with our loyalty partner.  To the extent that you sign up for such services or products through PropertyRoom.com, we may share your personal information with the other company in order to ship your products, issue or honor a rebate or otherwise provide the requested services. To the extent that you are directed to a co-branded web page operated by a third party, this privacy policy will not apply to you – instead the privacy policy of the partner posted on the webpage will be applicable and your personal information may be shared or used as described in the partner’s applicable privacy policy.  You may determine whether a co-branded web page is administered by PropertyRoom.com and therefore covered by this privacy policy by checking the privacy policy link.  If the co-branded web page has a privacy policy link that leads to this privacy policy, then it is covered by this privacy policy. If a co-branded web page does not have a link to a privacy policy or links to another provider’s privacy policy, then it is _not_ covered by this privacy policy. 

If you do not want your data to be shared when PropertyRoom.com is offering services and products in conjunction with another company, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not purchasing those particular products or not using that particular service.

In addition, our website may include hyperlinks to unaffiliated third parties’ websites.  This privacy policy cannot and does not apply to websites not operated by PropertyRoom.com.  You should consult each website’s privacy policy before providing any personal information to anyone else.

 **3\. How is your personal information used?**

PropertyRoom.com uses the personal information we collect to obtain payment for and to ship the products you purchase, to improve the content of our site, to respond to your inquiries and provide user support, to notify you about updates to our site or promotional offers or opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you and to investigate violations of our terms and conditions of use.

PropertyRoom.com records IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to provide summarized data to advertisers about the volume of use on our site. We also use demographic information (such as town/city, state, zip code, sex, and age provided by you) and traffic patterns to create summarized reports and database profiles (which do not contain personal information that can be used to identify any individual user) for our own use and for sharing with advertisers and partners. This allows these parties to advertise more effectively, and allows you to receive advertisements that are most relevant to your personal interests.

 **4\. With whom may your personal information be shared?**

Except as explicitly described in this privacy policy, PropertyRoom.com will not sell or share your name, address, phone numbers, email address, financial data or any other information that personally identifies you to third parties without your consent. 

By placing an order or bidding on an item, you are granting your consent to allow us to share your information with the law enforcement agency or other third party seller or vendor providing the purchased item. To the extent that you make a purchase, you are granting your consent to allow us to share your information with related service providers (such as a credit card processor for processing payment and a shipping company for shipping your purchase to you), in each case to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill that order.

PropertyRoom.com may divulge personal information to a third party service provider (such as a credit card processor) to resolve suspected fraud or other inappropriate use (or abuse) issues. In such an instance, PropertyRoom.com would divulge the information to resolve the issue whether you or PropertyRoom.com was suspected of the misuse, and such information would be divulged for the sole and exclusive purpose of resolving allegations of misuse or abuse.

PropertyRoom.com may also divulge personal information if such information is subpoenaed or requested by a law enforcement agency as part of an investigation. In addition, PropertyRoom.com may divulge personal information if PropertyRoom.com believes that its site has been used to commit unlawful acts, or acts that might endanger the health or safety of another user or of the general public.

On occasion, services and products on the PropertyRoom.com website may be offered in conjunction with another company.  To the extent that you sign up for such services or products through PropertyRoom.com, we may share your personal information with the other company in order to ship your products, issue or honor a rebate or otherwise provide the requested services.  By signing up for such services or products, you are granting your consent to allow us to share your information with the other company.

Lastly, in the event that PropertyRoom.com or substantially all of its assets are acquired, PropertyRoom.com would transfer all customer data and other personal information of its users to the new owner.

Your PropertyRoom.com account information is password protected so that only you have access to it. We strongly recommend that you not divulge your password to anyone.

Property Room.com stores all your personal information on secure servers and in an encrypted format.

No Internet data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, PropertyRoom.com cannot assure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best efforts to ensure its security on our systems.

Under no circumstances, including but not limited to negligence, shall PropertyRoom.com be liable for any special, incidental or consequential damages that result from the use of the information or materials on PropertyRoom.com, even if PropertyRoom.com or its authorized representative has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
