**1.Personal Information**  
Personal information is collected when users voluntarily register for membership services. These services include receiving electronic newsletters, purchasing items, and entering contests and other promotional opportunities provided by PropertyRoom.com. We also collect email addresses from users who send us mail or request technical or other help. This information enables PropertyRoom.com to improve its site to make your online visits more productive and enjoyable.

One method of collecting summarized information about your activities online (such as the pages you access most frequently or the search terms you enter), and information volunteered by you (such as survey or registration information), is by tracking Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the web. The computers that deliver the Web pages to you automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from our site, our server logs your IP address.

PropertyRoom.com records IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to provide summarized data to advertisers about the volume of use on our site. We also create summarized reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers and partners. This allows these parties to advertise more effectively, and allows you to receive advertisements that are most relevant to your personal interests.

**2.Information Collection**  
When you are on our website and asked for personal information, you are sharing that information only with PropertyRoom.com, and necessary related service providers such as a credit card processor, and, if appropriate, the third party vendor providing the purchased item unless specifically stated otherwise. 

On occasion, services and products on the PropertyRoom.com website may be offered in conjunction with another company. To provide this co-branded service to you, it may become necessary for us to share your personal information with another company in order to ship your products or provide services. However, if you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service or purchasing products.

**3.Information Usage**  
PropertyRoom.com uses the personal information we collect to obtain payment for and to ship the products you purchase; to improve the content of our site; to notify users about updates to our site or promotional offers or opportunities that we believe will be of interest to users; and to investigate violations of our terms and conditions of use.

**4.Information Sharing**  
PropertyRoom.com will not sell or share your name, address, phone numbers, email address or any other information that personally identifies you to third parties without your consent. In some cases, your name and shipping address may be shared with a shipping company for the purpose of shipping your purchase to you. Demographic information, such as town/city, state, zip code, sex, and age provided by you may be included in a summarized customer database profile, which may be used to attract potential suppliers and advertisers to our website.

If you bid on an item, PropertyRoom.com may disclose your personally identifiable information to a law enforcement agency or a party that provided the item to PropertyRoom.com for sale. PropertyRoom.com may divulge personal information if such information is subpoenaed, requested by a law enforcement agency as part of an investigation. In addition, PropertyRoom.com may divulge personal information if PropertyRoom.com believes that its site has been used to commit unlawful acts, or acts that might endanger the health or safety or another user or of the general public.

Lastly, PropertyRoom.com may divulge personally identifiable information to a third party service provider to resolve suspected spam, fraud or other such inappropriate use (or abuse) issues. In such an instance, PropertyRoom.com would divulge the information to resolve the issue whether you or PropertyRoom.com was suspected of the misuse, and such information would be divulged for the sole and exclusive purpose of resolving allegations of misuse or abuse.

In the event that PropertyRoom.com, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the assets transferred to new owners.
