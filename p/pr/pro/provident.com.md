# Privacy - Provident Funding

**Provident Funding Associates, L.P., also doing business as Provident Funding Group, Inc., Provident Home Loans and Provident Funding Loans, Inc. (collectively "Provident Funding") is committed to respecting the privacy rights of all users of its website. The following policy describes how Provident Funding uses and protects the information that is provided or collected through this website.**

**Does Provident Funding disclose any of the personally identifiable information that it collects from its visitors to outside parties?** Provident Funding may share the non-public information of our customers and former customers (but not of consumers who are only visitors to our site who have never registered and obtained a user name and password). To print an opt-out notice, please select "Form" from the "My Account" section of our website.

**What information does Provident Funding collect and how is it used?** You may visit and use certain features of our site without any registration in which case none of your personal information will be collected or retained. However, to access your account or other non-public information on our site, as an existing or former Provident Funding customer, you will need to register by creating a username and password. To register you are required to provide your e-mail address, loan or application numberproperty zip code and your social security number for identification purposes. You will also have to select a username and password.

If you are applying for a loan on our site for the first time, you need to complete a loan application by providing necessary personally identifiable information, including contact, property, employment, income, assets and liabilities information, as well as various additional demographic information and declarations.

Whether you are a new or an existing customer, the information you provide allows Provident Funding to establish a user profile so that we may customize your preferences, send you the information that you desire and establish security measures to ensure that only you, and those with your authorization, have access to your account. It will allow you, as a customer, to access your application information and status. It also allows us to provide a faster method for you to submit and receive information to and from Provident Funding. We may also use your computer's IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to otherwise administer our site, as well as to gather broad aggregated demographic information such as the number of visitors from a particular geographic area.

**How does Provident Funding protect visitor information?** We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the privacy of your information. Personally identifiable user information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to such systems. We offer the use of a secure server when you post or access your information. All sensitive information supplied by you will be transmitted and protected via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software and the HTTPS protocol for encrypted transfer of data.

To ensure compliance with updated security technology, Provident Funding recommends that you use one of the following browsers which can be downloaded free of charge: Netscape Navigator (http://www.netscape.com), or Microsoft Internet Explorer (http://www.microsoft.com/ie). To ensure the highest level of security available today, Provident Funding suggests that you choose the 128-bit encryption and most updated version from the download options. If you do not have access to a browser that supports at least 48-bit encryption, your information may not be processed by our servers, or may not be securely transferred through your web browser to our servers.

When you submit information to Provident Funding, or to any other website, over the Internet the information may travel over many networks and systems that are not under our control. The Internet is not completely secure and others may intercept the information that you are sending. Further, anything that you voluntarily provide in any public non-secure area of the Internet, including on our website, will be publicly available to other visitors on that website and potentially to other third parties. You should always exercise caution when deciding to publicly disclose any of your personal information. 

**Does Provident Funding use "cookies"?** Cookies are bits of electronic information that a website can transfer to a visitor's hard drive to help to tailor and keep records of his or her visit to the site. Cookies allow website operators to better customize visits to the site based on the visitor's preferences. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many websites use them. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies you can usually change your browser to prevent or notify you whenever you are sent a cookie. This gives you an opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it. Even without accepting a cookie you can still access most of the features on our site. We use cookies so that we can provide our customers and registered users with a better and more efficient experience on our site as well as to provide for a faster method of logging-in to your account. We suggest that you visit http://www.cookiecentral.com if you would like more information about cookies.

**Provident Funding special note to parents:** Provident Funding is specifically a financial services website that does not contain any content directed to children under the age of 13. However, to the extent that any child under the age of 13 enters our site, pursuant to the provisions of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we are not permitted, and therefore do not, collect any personally identifiable information from any child that we actually know to be under thirteen years of age without the consent of that child's parent or legal guardian.

**How does a registered user remove or modify the information that they have provided to Provident Funding?** After registering on our site, Provident Funding allows you to modify certain portions of your personal information by any of the following avenues:   
• Submitting a request to update information through your online account   
• Contacting us directly at 1-800-696-8199    
Provident allows users to request modification of their phone number and mailing address under the Contact Info section of their “My Account” page. Clicking “Edit” will allow the user to submit a “Case” to Provident Funding Servicing Division for review and implementation of the request. All requests for updates are subject to verification to ensure the security and integrity of your account. You may be requested to provide documentation to support any allowable change requested. 

**Third party links and co-brand relationships:** Provident Funding may choose various third party websites to link to and from, and frame within, its own site to provide increased value to our visitors. Provident Funding may also participate in co-branding and other relationships to offer information, programs and other services and features to its users. However, Provident Funding has no control over these linked sites, each of which have separate privacy and data collection practices independent of Provident Funding, even if such third party is affiliated with Provident Funding.

Data collected by our co-brand partners or third party websites, even if it is offered on or through our site, is not received, stored, or used in any way by us. As such, we have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions and are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any such websites. These linked sites are only for your convenience and you access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, Provident Funding seeks to protect the integrity of its website, and the links placed upon it, and we therefore request your feedback on our website and any that we link to as well (including if a specific link does not work). 

**Your Consent:** You consent to the collection and use of information by Provident Funding, as set forth in this Privacy Statement, by using our website. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what limited circumstances we may disclose it. Continued access or use of the website shall constitute your express acceptance of any modifications to this Privacy Statement.
