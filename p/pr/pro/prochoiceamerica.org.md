 **How do we use the information you provide NARAL Pro-Choice America, the NARAL Pro-Choice America Foundation and NARAL Pro-Choice America PAC?**

 **When you volunteer online or sign up for the Choice Action Network:** Our forms ask you to give NARAL Pro-Choice America, the NARAL Pro-Choice America Foundation and NARAL Pro-Choice America PAC contact information including: name, mailing address, e-mail address and how you wish to help us. Unless you opt out, we will use your e-mail address to send you updates on reproductive health issues and to ask you to take an action such as contacting your Congressperson. Additionally, you may receive periodic fundraising communications.

NARAL Pro-Choice America, the NARAL Pro-Choice America Foundation and NARAL Pro-Choice America PAC exchange e-mail names within its sister organizations to the extent permitted by law but not with other non-NARAL Pro-Choice America organizations. You may remove your name from our e-mailing lists at any time by emailing a request to [can@ProChoiceAmerica.org](mailto:can@ProChoiceAmerica.org).

We use your address information to send you information about NARAL Pro-Choice America, the NARAL Pro-Choice America Foundation and NARAL Pro-Choice America PAC and to help match your interests to our grassroots organizing efforts. Since we are a grassroots organization, we will provide your contact information to our national field staff and State Affiliates. You may remove your name from all of our volunteer and activist lists by sending your request to [can@ProChoiceAmerica.org](mailto:can@ProChoiceAmerica.org). We do not share our volunteer or activist lists with any other site or any other non-NARAL Pro-Choice America entity.

 **When you contribute money online:** NARAL Pro-Choice America and the NARAL Pro-Choice America Foundation accept contributions by credit card online. In addition to your name, mailing address and email address, we make a note of your telephone number if you choose to provide it, but you are not required to do so. By providing us with this information, you allow us to quickly contact you concerning federal legislation, our grassroots efforts and new publications such as our _Who Decides? The Status of Women's Reproductive Rights in the United States_.

NARAL Pro-Choice America may exchange or rent our contributor list of names and mailing addresses to other organizations unless you use the opt-out feature on the contribution page. We do not exchange e-mail addresses.

Unless you opt out, we may use the information you provide us when you contribute by mail or online, or when you download a form from our web site to contact you for other purposes or to solicit you for additional contributions.

NARAL Pro-Choice America purchases mailing lists from other organizations and as a result you may receive mailings or e-mail from us.
