# Promotions.com, Inc.

**OUR PROMISE**  
We are committed to protecting your privacy. We promise to handle all information you provide at Promotions.com, including customer contact and account information, transaction information, and all correspondence, with complete discretion. We will not release, sell or give your name, email address, or any other personally identifiable information to any other entity, party or organization except as disclosed in this statement. 

**OUR POLICY**  
Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, we have created this policy statement to disclose the information practices of Promotions.com including: 

  1. What personally identifiable information of yours is collected from you through Promotions.com; 
  2. The organization collecting the information; 
  3. How the information is used; 
  4. With whom the information may be shared; 
  5. What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information; 
  6. The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Promotions.com's control.



**What Personally Identifiable Information of yours is collected**  
When you visit Promotions.com, you will be asked to provide certain information about yourself (e.g., contact and demographic information) in our one-time registration form, which will appear automatically the first time you visit our Web site. Upon filling out the registration form you will become a member of Promotions.com. We use this information to learn more about you, so we can provide you with the content and information most attuned to your interests. _You must be at least 13 years of age to become a member of Promotions.com (see "Children" section below)_.

**ANONYMOUS INFORMATION**  
When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser (such as Netscape NavigatorÂ® or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits some Anonymous Information to Promotions.com every time you access content on Promotions.com. Examples of such information include the URL of the Web page you just came from (known as the "Refer"), the IP (or Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, or the browser version you are using to access Promotions.com. All of this information is collected by Promotions.com and is used to help improve our offerings to you. For instance, from this information we may determine that only a few of our visitors use older browser versions. With this information, we could enhance the quality of content available to all of our visitors by using the advanced features of HTML that can only be accessed from newer browser versions. All of the information that is automatically submitted to us by your browser is considered Anonymous Information. Anonymous Information is defined as information that does not specifically identify you. 

**What Organization is collecting the information**  
The data you provide to Promotions.com is collected by Promotions.com. Promotions.com is a web site owned and operated by Promotions.com. To find out more information about Promotions.com, please visit us at [www.promotions.com](http://www.promotions.com/). 

**How the information is used**  
Our services have been designed to enable Promotions.com to provide personalized content to those members who wish to receive it. The majority of the services that are provided for free at Promotions.com are the result of advertising revenues. Our ability to provide enhanced services and content to our members is dependent on our ability to provide venues for our advertising partners that reach specific demographic segments of our member base. Generally, advertisers have little interest in reaching a specific member - and as a matter of policy we provide no mechanism for an advertiser to reach you or any other specific member unless you request that contact. Instead, our advertising partners have the need to reach members who share common demographic characteristics such as a specific gender or age range. For instance, certain products are more often purchased by men than by women; and, therefore, when advertising those products, in this example the advertiser would prefer to target their messages just to men. The better job Promotions.com does in providing a mechanism for advertisers to reach specific sub-segments of our members, the more revenue we can generate from advertising and that ultimately is what allows you to get to the wealth of free content that is available at Promotions.com. 

Below is a description of the uses of the information that we collect and how our visitors and advertisers benefit from such uses: 

  1. If you win a prize offered at Promotions.com, we'll use the information you supplied to contact you in connection with the applicable sweepstakes, contest or instant win game. We'll probably also congratulate you on winning! 
  2. We pay attention to what our members do and do not use on our service and modify our content appropriately.
  3. We provide personalized content in the form of enabling our members to auto-enter their email address to enter sweepstakes or play instant win games. 
  4. We develop summary - but not individual - reports for our advertisers. We do not identify you in these summary reports! An example of a summary report might be "12,000 people clicked on Advertisement 'X' today, and of those people, 35% had previously indicated they had an interest in sports." Our advertisers, who make it possible for you to use Promotions.com for free, need this information to determine how effective their advertising investments are. We do not tell our advertisers who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements. 
  5. Through our Promotions.com newsletters and Opt-In email service, we will send members outbound email communications on information we think they will find useful, including information about new products and services from selected partners. It is our policy to never send messages to our members who have asked us not to do so, either at initial registration or later through an unsubscribe process. In every email from Promotions.com or other selected company, we will remind you of your option to change your preferences regarding receipt of future email communications. 



**How the information is shared**  
Information about our members is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. Your personally identifiable information will not be shared with any third party without your permission except as disclosed herein. 

When you opt-in to receive special offers from other companies, your personally identifiable information may be shared with reputable third parties who wish to contact you regarding selected retail opportunities and other marketing programs. If you do not want your information used for these purposes, just click "no" to this statement on your registration form: "I'd also like to receive notification of exclusive product discounts, free samples and other special offers from Promotions.com and it's partners." 

Non-personally identifiable information may be shared with advertisers in anonymous group statistical form only. This allows advertisers to participate more effectively in the system by providing offers targeted to the interests of our various member groups. For example, an advertiser may be notified that 10,000 members have expressed an interest in receiving offers relating to buying a new car. 

**What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information**  
Promotions.com offers you the ability to control your information and the email communications that you receive. First, as mentioned earlier, the consumer always has the final word on whether Promotions.com - or any Internet company - knows who you are. It is your choice to share personally identifiable information with Promotions.com and we encourage you to consider only sharing information with any site on the Internet if you receive true value in exchange for that information transfer and if you respect the privacy practices of the company.

If you do choose to share personally identifiable information with Promotions.com, you can control whether we contact you or share the information with third parties, either through declarations you make at the time you share information with us, or through updates to your information. Any time information is requested, you should see the TRUSTe logo that links to our Privacy Policy and a clear indication of what your information distribution choices are. Promotions.com will always give you a chance to unsubscribe to any email communication from us - clear directions for doing so will appear in any email message we send to you. 

At times, Promotions.com may enter into co-branding arrangements with other companies, and if so, an opt-in question may appear for contact from these companies as well. Their opt-in features are specific to each organization, but you should never receive email from these organizations unless you have indicated that it is acceptable. All email from Promotions.com, or from co-brand partners who gain your permission to send you commercial email, will include an opportunity to opt out of future communications. 

Promotions.com reserves the right to send a one-time registration confirmation email, and occasional Service Alert messages to our members to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of whether they have opted-in to receive emails from us. And finally, we also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of our Terms and Conditions of Use. However, we will not contact you to market a new or existing service if you have asked us not to do so. 

NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IN THE EVENT THAT PROMOTIONS.COM OR SOME OF ITS ASSETS ARE ACQUIRED, MEMBER INFORMATION MAY BE ONE OF THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS. 

For additional information, please refer to the final section of this privacy policy entitled "Changes in Policy".

**Third-Party Links**  
For your convenience Promotions.com contains links to third-party Web sites that are not owned or controlled by us. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other Web sites and they may or may not be members of TrustE.
