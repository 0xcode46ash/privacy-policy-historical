# Promotions.com, Inc.

**OUR PROMISE**  
We are committed to protecting your privacy. We promise to handle all information you provide at Webstakes.com, including customer contact and account information, transaction information, and all correspondence, with complete discretion. We will not release, sell or give your name, email address, or any other personally identifiable information to any other entity, party or organization except as disclosed in this statement. 

**OUR POLICY**  
Promotions.com owns and operates the Internet domain [www.webstakes.com](http://home.webstakes.com/play/HomePage?temp=2041&tb_id=301&cm=y) ("Webstakes.com"). This statement discloses the privacy practices for Webstakes.com. To see terms and conditions of usage, [click here](http://home.webstakes.com/play/HomePage?temp=2001&tb_id=1). 

Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, we have created this policy statement to disclose the information practices of Webstakes.com and agreed to have this Privacy Policy reviewed for compliance by TrustE. This organization is an independent initiative whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting principles of full disclosure and informed consent. By displaying the TrustE mark, we have agreed to notify you of: 

  1. What personally identifiable information of yours is collected from you through Webstakes.com; 
  2. The organization collecting the information; 
  3. How the information is used; 
  4. With whom the information may be shared; 
  5. What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information; 
  6. The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Webstakes.com's control; and 
  7. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. 



If you have questions or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy, you should first contact us by sending an email to [privacy@webstakes.com](mailto:privacy@webstakes.com). If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed by us, you should then contact [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/watchdog.html). TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with Webstakes.com to resolve your concerns. 

The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for Webstakes.com. Our goal is to keep you informed of special offers and products that match your interests and enhance your life, but your participation in any offer, survey, promotion, or contest is completely optional. 

**What Personally Identifiable Information of yours is collected**  
When you visit Webstakes.com, you will be asked to provide certain information about yourself (e.g., contact and demographic information) in our one-time registration form, which will appear automatically the first time you visit our Web site. Upon filling out the registration form you will become a member of Webstakes.com. We use this information to learn more about you, so we can provide you with the content and information most attuned to your interests. _You must be at least 13 years of age to become a member of Webstakes.com (see "Children" section below)_.

**ANONYMOUS INFORMATION**  
When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser (such as Netscape NavigatorÂ® or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits some Anonymous Information to Webstakes.com every time you access content on Webstakes.com. Examples of such information include the URL of the Web page you just came from (known as the "Refer"), the IP (or Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, or the browser version you are using to access Webstakes.com. All of this information is collected by Webstakes.com and is used to help improve our offerings to you. For instance, from this information we may determine that only a few of our visitors use older browser versions. With this information, we could enhance the quality of content available to all of our visitors by using the advanced features of HTML that can only be accessed from newer browser versions. All of the information that is automatically submitted to us by your browser is considered Anonymous Information. Anonymous Information is defined as information that does not specifically identify you. 

**COOKIES**  
To enable many of the features available at Webstakes.com, we assign "cookies" to your Internet browser. A cookie is a small text file that contains a unique identification number stored on your computer. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. This unique identification number automatically identifies your browser - but not you - to our computers whenever you interact with Webstakes.com. Only when you agree to provide personally identifiable information directly to Webstakes.com through our registration form will we be able to know anything about you other than the random number that our server computers originally assign to your browser. 

Webstakes.com uses "cookie" technology to make your visits more convenient for you. We use cookies to give you the option of saving your email address so you don't have to enter it repeatedly when you are entering different sweepstakes and contest offered on Webstakes.com and to identify where you came from and if you've been to Webstakes.com before. These are set so we may better customize your experience on Webstakes.com for your future visits. You are free to reject or "Not Accept" the placement of some or all of our cookies, but you will not be able to auto-enter your email address, participate in our instant win games or customize your future visits. 

There is a lot of confusion about cookies, how they are used, and what they can do. Cookies only contain information that the server computer "knew" in the first place, and can only be read by the serving domain that placed them. For instance, if XYZ.com (a fictitious company) utilizes cookies, Webstakes.com's servers can't read their contents nor can XYZ.com's servers read ours. Cookies are an essential part of how the Internet works today, and allow server computers to recognize your computer's browser when you return. If you have ever visited a Web page that automatically provides personalized content without you having to "sign in," such as your own stock portfolio, this is almost certainly being accomplished with a cookie. Since cookies are only text files, they cannot "run" on your computer and have no ability to search your computer for other information, or transmit it to anyone.

**3rd Party Cookies**  
Webstakes.com is supported, in part, through advertising. Some advertisers and/or the agency that provides the banner or other advertisements place cookies on your browser for research and marketing purposes. The use of advertising cookies sent by 3rd-party servers is common in the Internet industry. Webstakes.com does not control such 3rd party cookies, and these cookies are not subject to this policy.

**iDIALOG**   
Webstakes.com uses a proprietary technology entitled iDIALOG to communicate or "dialog" with our members about special products and offers during a promotion. Each time members enter a promotion at Webstakes.com they are presented with an iDIALOG question asking them if they would like to "opt-in" to receive more information. For example, an iDIALOG question may ask "Are you buying a car soon? Webstakes.com Auto Channel Newsletter will be offering exclusive offers to members only". Members will then be presented with the option of subscribing to the newsletter or rejecting the offer by clicking on the appropriate response. 

**What Organization is collecting the information**  
The data you provide to Webstakes.com is collected by Promotions.com. Webstakes.com is a web site owned and operated by Promotions.com. To find out more information about Promotions.com, please visit us at [www.promotions.com](file:///get%20lucky/site%3A/aboutus.html). 

**How the information is used**  
Our services have been designed to enable Webstakes.com to provide personalized content to those members who wish to receive it. The majority of the services that are provided for free at Webstakes.com are the result of advertising revenues. Our ability to provide enhanced services and content to our members is dependent on our ability to provide venues for our advertising partners that reach specific demographic segments of our member base. Generally, advertisers have little interest in reaching a specific member - and as a matter of policy we provide no mechanism for an advertiser to reach you or any other specific member unless you request that contact. Instead, our advertising partners have the need to reach members who share common demographic characteristics such as a specific gender or age range. For instance, certain products are more often purchased by men than by women; and, therefore, when advertising those products, in this example the advertiser would prefer to target their messages just to men. The better job Webstakes.com does in providing a mechanism for advertisers to reach specific sub-segments of our members, the more revenue we can generate from advertising and that ultimately is what allows you to get to the wealth of free content that is available at Webstakes.com. 

Below is a description of the uses of the information that we collect and how our visitors and advertisers benefit from such uses: 

  1. If you win a prize offered at Webstakes.com, we'll use the information you supplied to contact you in connection with the applicable sweepstakes, contest or instant win game. We'll probably also congratulate you on winning! 
  2. We pay attention to what our members do and do not use on our service and modify our content appropriately.
  3. We provide personalized content in the form of enabling our members to auto-enter their email address to enter sweepstakes or play instant win games. 
  4. We develop summary - but not individual - reports for our advertisers. We do not identify you in these summary reports! An example of a summary report might be "12,000 people clicked on Advertisement 'X' today, and of those people, 35% had previously indicated they had an interest in sports." Our advertisers, who make it possible for you to use Webstakes.com for free, need this information to determine how effective their advertising investments are. We do not tell our advertisers who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements. 
  5. Through our Webstakes.com newsletters and Opt-In email service, we will send members outbound email communications on information we think they will find useful, including information about new products and services from selected partners. It is our policy to never send messages to our members who have asked us not to do so, either at initial registration or later through an unsubscribe process. In every email from Webstakes.com or other selected company, we will remind you of your option to change your preferences regarding receipt of future email communications. 



**How the information is shared**  
Information about our members is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. Your personally identifiable information will not be shared with any third party without your permission except as disclosed herein. 

When you opt-in to receive special offers from other companies, your personally identifiable information may be shared with reputable third parties who wish to contact you regarding selected retail opportunities and other marketing programs. If you do not want your information used for these purposes, just click "no" to this statement on your registration form: "I'd also like to receive notification of exclusive product discounts, free samples and other special offers from Webstakes.com and it's partners." 

Non-personally identifiable information may be shared with advertisers in anonymous group statistical form only. This allows advertisers to participate more effectively in the system by providing offers targeted to the interests of our various member groups. For example, an advertiser may be notified that 10,000 members have expressed an interest in receiving offers relating to buying a new car. 

**What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information**  
Webstakes.com offers you the ability to control your information and the email communications that you receive. First, as mentioned earlier, the consumer always has the final word on whether Webstakes.com - or any Internet company - knows who you are. It is your choice to share personally identifiable information with Webstakes.com and we encourage you to consider only sharing information with any site on the Internet if you receive true value in exchange for that information transfer and if you respect the privacy practices of the company.

If you do choose to share personally identifiable information with Webstakes.com, you can control whether we contact you or share the information with third parties, either through declarations you make at the time you share information with us, or through updates to your information. Any time information is requested, you should see the TRUSTe logo that links to our Privacy Policy and a clear indication of what your information distribution choices are. Webstakes.com will always give you a chance to unsubscribe to any email communication from us - clear directions for doing so will appear in any email message we send to you. 

At times, Webstakes.com may enter into co-branding arrangements with other companies, and if so, an opt-in question may appear for contact from these companies as well. Their opt-in features are specific to each organization, but you should never receive email from these organizations unless you have indicated that it is acceptable. All email from Webstakes.com, or from co-brand partners who gain your permission to send you commercial email, will include an opportunity to opt out of future communications. 

Webstakes.com reserves the right to send a one-time registration confirmation email, and occasional Service Alert messages to our members to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of whether they have opted-in to receive emails from us. And finally, we also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of our Terms and Conditions of Use. However, we will not contact you to market a new or existing service if you have asked us not to do so. 

NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IN THE EVENT THAT PROMOTIONS.COM OR SOME OF ITS ASSETS ARE ACQUIRED, MEMBER INFORMATION MAY BE ONE OF THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS. 

For additional information, please refer to the final section of this privacy policy entitled "Changes in Policy". 

**What kind of security procedures are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information under the company's control**  
Webstakes.com operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our members. 

**How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information**  
Webstakes.com believes strongly in providing you with the ability to access and edit the personally identifiable information that you have provided to us. To update the information retained about you, or to deactivate your account, please visit our Registration Update page at [http://misc.webstakes.com/NDLogin.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20011218001202id_/http%3A//promotions.com/%3Cfont%20face=%22Arial,%20Helvetica,%20sans-serif%22%20size=%222%22%20color=%22#666666%22%3Ehttp://misc.webstakes.com/NDLogin.html%3C/font%3E).
