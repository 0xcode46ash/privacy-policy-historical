**1\. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS**

Under California Law, California residents may have the right to request in writing from businesses with whom they have an established business relationship: (a) a list of the categories of Personally Identifiable Information and the type of services provided to the customer, that a business has disclosed to third parties (including affiliates that are separate legal entities) during the immediately preceding calendar year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes and (b) the names and addresses of all such third parties. To make such requests, if entitled, please write to California Privacy Rights c/o **Legendary Digital Networks** , LLC; 2325 Naomi Street, Burbank, CA 91504 

**2\. INFORMATION WE COLLECT THROUGH THE DIGITAL SERVICE**

**Collection of Usage Information.**  When users use the Digital Service (including by accessing its associated Website and/or Mobile Applications), we automatically collect “Usage Information” which include among other things, which pages of our Website or sections of our Mobile Applications were visited; the order in which they were visited; when they were visited; which hyperlinks were “clicked”; your activity on the Digital Service (such as title selections, watch history and search queries); and details regarding your interactions with customer service (such as the date, time and reason for contacting us, transcripts of any chat conversations, and if you call us, your phone number). We also collect information from the URLs from which you linked to our Website or to access our Mobile Applications. Collecting such information may involve logging the IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for your computer, mobile phone, tablet, gaming system, smart TV, set top box, or other device (any, a “Device”) used to access the Website, Mobile Applications or other components of the Digital Service, operating system and browser software used by each user of the Digital Service. Although such information is not Personally Identifiable Information, we may be able to determine from an IP address a user’s Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity. Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your Personally Identifiable Information, we will treat it as Personally Identifiable Information.

**Technology Used on the Digital Service.**   We also use or may use cookies, web beacons and/or embedded scripts to help us determine and identify repeat visitors, the type of content and sites to which a user of our Digital Service links, the length of time each user spends at any particular area of our Digital Service, and the specific functionalities that users choose to use. Essentially, cookies are a user’s identification card for the LDN servers. Web beacons are small graphic files linked to our servers that allow us to track your use of our Digital Service and related functionalities. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Digital Service, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Digital Service, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

Cookies, web beacons and embedded script allow LDN to serve you better and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience at our Digital Service. Cookies, web beacons and embedded script are not used to retain Personally Identifiable Information. You should be able to control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your web browser. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the “Help” section of the toolbar. If you reject our cookies, certain of the functions and conveniences of the Digital Service may not work properly, but you do not have to accept our cookies in order to use many functionalities of the Digital Service.

California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b)(as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how LDN responds to “Do Not Track” browser settings. LDN does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.

**Collection of Personally Identifiable Information.**  In order to access certain features and benefits on our Digital Service, you may need to submit “Personally Identifiable Information” (i.e., information that can be used to identify you). Personally Identifiable Information can include information such as your name, address, telephone number and email address. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personally Identifiable Information you submit to LDN. Inaccurate information may affect your ability to use the Digital Service, the information you receive when using the Digital Service, and our ability to contact you. For example, your email address should be kept current because that is one of the primary manners in which we communicate with you. We may collect Personally Identifiable Information in connection with various functionality and services offered via the Digital Service, including the following:

**(a) Updates and Newsletters.**  LDN may offer you the ability to receive email updates and newsletters. In order to subscribe to these services, you may be required to provide us with Personally Identifiable Information such as your name, email address and zip code.

**(b) Participation in Contests, Sweepstakes, and Other Promotions.**  LDN may offer you the opportunity to participate in a contest, sweepstakes, or other promotions on or through the Digital Service. If you desire to participate in any such contest, sweepstakes, or other promotion, you will be asked to provide us with certain information necessary to conduct such contest, sweepstakes, or other promotion. This information may include, among other things, your name, age, mailing address, email address, and phone number.

**(c) Communications with LDN.**  We may receive Personally Identifiable Information when you send us an email message or otherwise contact us.

**(d) Social Media Interaction.**  We may receive Personally Identifiable Information when you engage with our Digital Service on or through third-party social networking sites, such as Facebook or Twitter, and allow us to have access to information from your profile (e.g., name, email address, photo, gender, birthday, location, friends, followers, the posts or the ‘likes’ you make). You can control what data you share through privacy settings available on some social networking sites. For more information about how you can customize your privacy settings and how such third-party sites treat your Personally Identifiable Information, please refer to their privacy policies and terms of use.

**(e) Metadata.**  Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted. Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other’s APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if you make your photo public by posting it on our Digital Service.

**Social Media Features and Widgets.** Our Digital Service may include social media plug-ins and features (such as the Facebook Like button) and widgets (such as the “Share This” button) or interactive mini-programs that run on our Digital Service. In addition, our Digital Service may also permit or require you to register or log into your account via a social networking platform such as Login with Facebook. 

These social media features and plug-ins may share with us your username and password for the social media services and other information available about you or collected from you on these social media services, in accordance with the terms and conditions ( _e.g.,_ terms of use and privacy policy) of the company providing them. We may also collect information you have authorized the third party service to share with us (such as your billing information, public profile information, email address, birthday, friends list, pages you have “liked” and other account and profile data.) In addition, the companies providing these features and plug-ins may be able to collect information about you, including your IP address, your activity on our Digital Service, and they may notify your connections on the social networking platform about your use of our Digital Service. These social media services may also set a cookie to enable a feature to function properly, and employ unique identifiers which allow your activity to be monitored across multiple web sites and Mobile Applications for purposes of delivering more targeted advertising to you.

Social media features and widgets are hosted by either a third-party or hosted directly on our Website or Mobile Applications. Your interactions with these plugs-in and features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them. 

**Information Collected by Mobile Applications.** The Digital Service may be provided or accessible through a Mobile Application. You agree that we may collect and use technical data and related information, including but not limited to, technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and other services to you (if any) related to any such Mobile Applications.

  * To prevent, discover and investigate violations of this Privacy Policy or any applicable terms of service or terms of use for the Mobile Application;

  * To customize the content or services on the Mobile Application for you, or the communications sent to you through the Mobile Application (if any)




We may associate your unique Device Identifier or Mobile Application usage information with any Personal Information you provide. 

For purposes of your use of any of our Mobile Applications and the services offered through any Mobile Application, the Mobile Application may also collect certain information about you (including Personal Information) that you knowingly supply to the Mobile Application such as the following:

  * Your user name and any password required by the Mobile Application

  * Age

  * Gender

Furthermore, the Digital Service may be provided through platforms operated by third parties – such as accessing the Digital Service through third-party platforms such as gaming systems, smart TVs, mobile devices, set top boxes and other Internet-connected devices (“Third Party Platforms”).

**5\. PUBLIC FORUMS/USER CONTENT**

When you post User Content (as defined herein and in the _Terms of Service_ ) you do so at your own risk. LDN cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your content and Personally Identifiable Information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that User Content you post on the Digital Service will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily post public information to websites, blogs, message boards, chat rooms or any other public forums, such information can be accessed by the public and can in turn be used by those people to send you unsolicited communications. If you choose to “like” content on our Digital Service or to otherwise post information from or via our Digital Service to third party web sites, features or applications, that information will become public and the third party web sites may have access to information about you and your use of our Digital Service.

**6\. SECURITY**

We incorporate commercially reasonable safeguards to help protect and secure your Personally Identifiable Information. However, no data transmission over the Internet, wireless transmission or electronic storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use our Digital Service and provide us with your information at your own risk.

**7\. UPDATING OR DELETING YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION**

You may unsubscribe from certain email communications by clicking the “ **Unsubscribe** ” link provided at the bottom of an email sent to you by LDN.

We try to answer email promptly, but may not always be able to do so. Keep in mind, however, that there will be residual information that will remain within our databases, access logs and other records, which may or may not contain your Personally Identifiable Information. Please note that we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your use of the Digital Service and these transactional messages may be unaffected if you choose to opt-out from marketing communications.

**8\. AD SERVING**

LDN may use third party network advertisers and similar vendors to serve our advertisements across the internet and third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the Digital Service and viewing of our content. We do not share Personally Identifiable Information with these third parties, but ad network providers and analytics service providers may set and access their own cookies, web beacons and embedded scripts on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, including Usage Information.

With regard to advertisements, we and our network advertisers may target advertisements for products and services in which you might be interested based on your visits to both the Website and other web sites. Cookies and web beacons, including those set by third party network advertisers, may be used to, among other things, target advertisements, prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times, or to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. We may share Usage Information about visitors to the Digital Service with third party advertising companies for the same purposes. We may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements. You may wish to visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>, which provides information regarding the “opt-out” procedures of certain third party ad servers we may use.

**9\. GOOGLE ANALYTICS**

LDN uses a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about use of the Website associated with the Digital Service. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit the Website, what pages they visit when they do so, what other sites they used prior to coming to the Website, and user demographic data, such as age, gender, and interests. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve the Website and Digital Service. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Website, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information, unless you explicitly submit that information through our website. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Website, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Website is restricted by the [Google Analytics Terms of Use](http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) and the [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/privacy.html).

**10\. CHANGING OUR PRIVACY POLICY**

Please note that we review our privacy practices from time to time, and that these practices are subject to change. Any change, update, or modification will be effective immediately upon posting on our Digital Service. LDN will not use your Personally Identifiable Information in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time it was collected without your consent.

**11\. JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES — CONSENT TO TRANSFER**

The Digital Service is operated in the United States and intended for users located in the United States. If you are located in the European Union, Canada or anywhere else outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect, including, without limitation, Personally Identifiable Information, will be transferred to, processed and stored in the United States. The data protection laws in the United States may differ from those of the country in which you are located, and your Personally Identifiable Information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States according to laws of the United States. By using the Digital Service or providing us with any information, you consent to this transfer, processing and storage of your information in the United States.

**12\. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY**

The Digital Service consists of a general audience Website and Mobile Application(s), and we do not knowingly collect any Personally Identifiable Information from children younger than the age of thirteen (13).
