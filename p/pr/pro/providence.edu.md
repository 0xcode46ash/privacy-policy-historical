# Privacy Policy - Providence College - Providence College

## Protecting Privacy

Providence College is committed to protecting the privacy of its students, faculty, staff, alumni, and friends.  The College acknowledges the confidential nature of information it receives in the ordinary course of business involving these groups of individuals.  The personal information that you provide on our website will be used expressly for the purpose of processing the intended online transaction.  It will not be used for any other commercial or philanthropic purpose, and the information you provide will not be shared or sold to any other individual or organization. The College also uses third-party sites for some of its services.  Most of these sites are governed by their own privacy policy; otherwise, they have an agreement with the College to honor our privacy standards.  The College may provide aggregated statistical data to reputable third-party vendors, but this data will include no personally identifiable information.

Providence College does, upon explicit request of users, share information with other parties and gather information from other private data providers.  For example, the College receives test scores from testing agencies and will send transcripts to other educational institutions.  This action is taken only at the request of users (persons to whom the information applies). 

Providence College may release information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to enforce law, to enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements, or to protect personal safety or property rights.  We will share personally identifiable information about you when one or more of the following conditions apply: we have your consent to share the information; we respond to or comply with subpoenas, court orders, legal process, or regulations; or we employ other companies to perform functions on our behalf, such as processing credit card payments.  Such companies have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use this information for other purposes. 

The College has taken measures to protect personal information from loss, misuse or alteration; however, no website security procedures are foolproof.  Any personal information you submit to Providence College via its website is submitted at your own risk and the College will not be liable to you for any breach of security or inadvertent disclosure of your personal information.

Users accessing personal information do so via secure server software (SSL), which encrypts information users provide before we receive it.  As effective as encryption technology is, however, no security system is completely impenetrable; thus, we cannot guarantee absolute security of our database or that information you provide will not be intercepted while transmitted to us over the Internet. 

Several of our sites enable users to pay for services or products online with a credit card.  Unless otherwise noted, these transactions are encrypted.  In accordance with College policy, confidential information provided in these transactions is used only for the purposes described in that transaction and at that site.

Providence College makes forums, message boards, and news groups available to its users.  The College does not ordinarily log public chat sessions; however, any information that is disclosed via the above communication methods becomes public information and users should exercise caution when deciding to disclose confidential information in such manner. 

At various times, online surveys are being conducted on the College’s website.  Confidential information gathered in such online surveys is used only for the purposes (research or otherwise) indicated in the survey.  Unless otherwise noted, answers provided by responders are confidential and individual responses will be not improperly disclosed.  Aggregate (and non-personally identifiable data) from surveys may be shared with external third parties.
