## Privacy Policy

Problem-Attic is a web-based program developed by EducAide Software. We are pleased to make the program available to everyone in the educational community: teachers, academic coaches, tutors, homeschoolers, researchers, etc. 

Because of the wide appeal of Problem-Attic and its many possible uses (classroom instruction, assessment, blended and self-paced learning), you should carefully read this Privacy Policy and related [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms) to see what rules govern your particular situation. If you do not accept the rules, then you should not make any further use of Problem-Attic. 

EducAide Software (hereinafter “EAS”) collects and stores certain types of personal information, as follows: 

  * To make use of the selection, formatting, PDF creation, and export options in Problem-Attic (collectively the “Program”), you need to create an account. If you choose to do so, then EAS will ask for your first and last name and your email address. As an option, you may provide EAS with the name of your school and/or a job description. EAS will require you to confirm your email address for your account to be activated. 

  * After creating an account, you may use the features of the Program that are freely-available without providing EAS any additional personal information. You may, however, provide other information voluntarily through the Settings options in the Program, or through separate communications with EAS, such as a request for technical support. 

  * If you create an account, then EAS will collect information about your documents. This includes, among other things, the questions you have chosen, your formatting options, and whether you create/download a PDF version of the document or export the questions to another program. 

  * Regardless of whether you create an account, EAS will collect information about your general use of the Program, such as the pages that you visit and whether you have taken the Problem-Attic Tour. EducAide will also collect details that are publicly-available about your web browser and computer, such as IP address, operating system, and browser type and version. 

  * If you become part of a school-wide subscription, then EAS will know the name of your employer and possibly the grades and subjects that you teach. Certain information about your use, such as number of documents and last log-in, will become known also to the person(s) in charge of the subscription at your school. 




The information collected by EAS will be stored securely on EAS’s or other host servers. (EducAide uses some third-party vendors to provide hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technologies required to run the Program.) 

The information collected by EAS will _not_ be sold, traded, bartered, given away, or used for solication by a third-party without your explicit permission. 

EAS may use the information it collects to improve Program performance and quality of service, to study operation of the Program and user preferences, and to notify you of changes to the Program, including service interruptions, bugfixes, new features, or changes to [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms) or this Privacy Policy. 

EAS may share information it collects with any agent or direct affiliate, such as a content- or application-development partner or company hired by EAS to assist with emails, newsletters, marketing, and other customer and public relations activities. 

EAS may share the information it collects with third-parties, as EAS deems necessary, to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving threats to another person, violations of [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms), or as otherwise required by law. 

A cookie is a small amount of data, often including an anonymous unique identifier, which a web server sends to your browser and which gets saved on your local hard drive. In order to use the Program, you may need to change your browser settings so that it can save cookies. 

EAS uses cookies to record current session information, to track your usage of the Program, and at your option to store login information. 

EAS does _not_ put any cookies on your computer that track your other web-browsing activities, that track websites you visit after using the Program, or that make any attempt to uncover any additional personal information about you. 

EAS makes use of third-party tools like Google Analytics for the purpose of monitoring website traffic and improving performance. These third-party tools may put their own cookies on your computer. EAS does _not_ use them to collect information about you, nor do we provide the third parties with your account details. They may, however, be able to associate your IP address and email through data which they collect independently. 

EAS designed Problem-Attic to be a teacher tool that is used only _indirectly_ by students. EAS cannot know, however, whether a user of the Program is actually a teacher. Because sign-up requires only a name and email address, it is possible for a student to create an account and use it for self-study. In that case, the student would be subject to the Privacy Policy described here. 

Problem-Attic does have options for scoring tests. These are available to teachers at subscribing schools. They are also available for trial in what we call the Play Area. If a teacher uses the scoring options, then EAS will collect limited information from students. This information is used only to create reports for the teacher and is never shared with any third-party. Notably, the Program does _not_ collect or store any personally identifiable information about students. The information which it does collect is for all practical purposes _anonymized_. 

Here are further details about the scoring options and the safeguarding of student information: 

  * The Program does not use class rosters. At the teacher's option, students can submit their answers with first name only, initials, or any other identifier. 

  * The Program does not keep any individual student records. All data which is collected is _ad hoc_. It is for a single test or quiz, and teachers can delete it at any time. 

  * The Program can be used for self-paced or online learning, for which there is no data collection at all. In this case, the purpose of scoring is to show students their own results. 

  * The Program does not use cookies for online tests or other student-facing pages, and it makes no attempt to identify or track website usage of students who visit these pages. 

  * The Program stores all data using industry best practices for security and encryption. 




EAS reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make any significant changes, we will notify you by email (using the address you supplied when you created an account), and we will announce the changes on the Problem-Attic website and on your document home page, which you see after creating an account and logging in. It then becomes your responsibility to review the changes and decide if you agree with them. If you do not, then you should discontinue use of the Program. 

If you have questions or would like to comment on this Privacy Policy, please send an email to [support@problem-attic.com](mailto:support@problem-attic.com). Or, if you prefer, you may contact EAS by regular mail, phone or fax:
