  * ### [PHP Cookies](https://web.archive.org/php-cookies)

What are Cookies?

Cookie is a piece of information that is stored as text files on the visitor's browser/computer. This allows the website server to keep track of what a visitor is doing during their visit (or even across multiple visits).

As an example to this is Amazon.com: do you notice that if you visit Amazon.com, Amazon keeps track of the click you have made. Even if you come to the site after sometime, it knows that you had visited earlier and would show you your earlier visits. This happens because Amazon.com stores cookies on your computer.

Hi,

I'm creating and attaching a cooking for my application with some useful information. 

But this information is not accessible after that.

The problem is that when I try to attach too much information, my cookie is not passed forward. When I try to attach few information it's OK.

My questions:

What is the max length for cookies values?  
If it's a bug, there is any workaround for Tomcat 5.5?

I'm creating my cookie using the following code:

  * ### [Cross-login and parsing user specific data](https://web.archive.org/cross-login-and-parsing-user-specific-data)

Hey,

I want to develop an application for a website which provides user specific information. These user specific information of course are just visible as long as you're logged-in. Json-interface and parser will be hosted on a different server and I'm wondering how to handle the login + maintain a session in order to parse the data. The loginscript of the website which I want to parse is using POST and puts a cookie with username + md5 password. 

These are all information I can provide. Thanks in advance.
