Privacy Policy

Last updated June 15, 2006

What is the Pronto™ Service?

The Pronto™ Service is a free shopping service that instantly provides access to price and product comparisons while you shop online at your favorite merchants.

The Pronto Service notes the merchant web sites that you visit, identifies products displayed to you by those merchant web sites, and uses its comparison shopping database to find the same (or similar) products available on other internet sites, for the purposes of allowing you to compare prices and other factors. The Pronto Service displays this information to you via a small window that appears in the lower right-hand corner of your computer screen and offers you the ability to view additional information, including price or other information about where those products are offered for sale, by clicking on the small window. The Pronto Service includes both the Pronto application (the "Software") and the web site located at [www.pronto.com](http://www.pronto.com/welcome/index.do).

The Pronto Service is free. You can easily uninstall the Software at any time.

We believe your privacy is important. We are committed to respecting your privacy and your preferences with regard to how we communicate with you, and to appropriately handling information we receive from you and about you. We strongly encourage you to read this policy carefully before you install the Software and start using the Pronto Service. We encourage you to visit this page from time to time to remind yourself of our privacy practices and to check for any updates to our Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy describes: 

  * What types of information Pronto collects and what we do with it;
  * When we share the information we collect; and
  * What control you have over the information we collect, store and share.



What types of information we collect and what we do with it

Personally Identifiable Information

You do not need to provide any personally identifiable information to us to use most aspects of the Pronto Service. We do allow you the opportunity to register with Pronto in order to provide you with certain features, like Price Alerts (as described below and in our FAQ). If you choose to register with Pronto, the only personally identifiable information we collect currently is your email address. In addition, if you contact us or if you wish to receive information from us, we may ask for your email address and/or other personal information so that we may respond.

Except for System or Service Notices (see description below) we will not contact you by email without your prior consent. In addition, except for System or Service Notices, each email we send to you will allow you to unsubscribe from receiving any similar email notices from Pronto. You can change your email address in the "My Account" section of the Pronto Service.

More specifically, you agree that we may use your email address for the following:  
Price Alerts. Pronto allows you to set a "Price Alert" for a product that you may be interested in purchasing. Creating a Price Alert sets a target price that is lower than the current price of the product you are viewing. If your Price Alert has been triggered, we will send you a message to the then current email address you have provided to us.

System or Service Notices. You agree that we may contact you regarding significant changes or developments in the Pronto Service, this Privacy Policy, the EULA, or other issues that may affect your use of the Pronto Service.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information

Whether you register with Pronto or not, we also collect information that is non-personal or anonymous, meaning that the information does not identify you, but may identify your computer or your general geographic area. We may combine your non-personally identifiable information with some or all of our users, or we may combine your non-personally identifiable information with information from other sources, to do trend analyses or generate other reports to help us provide better utility for our users, our partners, or our business. We currently collect and use non-personally identifiable information as follows:

  * Your Zip Code.

If you register, we will ask for your zip code. You may also be given the opportunity to supply your zip code without registering in order to calculate your tax rate. We use your zip code to display the appropriate sales tax for products that you may be interested in purchasing. We may also use aggregate zip code information from all our users for our own reporting purposes and to improve our service.

  * Merchant Ratings and Comments.

If you are registered with Pronto, we may offer you the opportunity to rate merchants and/or make comments through the Pronto Service. If you decide to rate a merchant and/or supply a comment, you agree that we may associate an anonymous unique identifier with the ratings you provide to, among other things, limit the number of ratings or comments you can provide for any single merchant. We may display your ratings and/or comments on the Pronto Service, in marketing in connection with the Pronto Service and/or on or through third party services. We may also combine your ratings or comments with ratings and comments from other users to provide aggregate rating scores and comments for merchants. We may also provide you with the opportunity to supply an alias for any comment you decided to post and, if you choose to use an alias, we will attribute your comment to that alias. Please note that whenever we display your ratings and/or comments we may also display your anonymous unique identifier or your alias.

  * Cookies and Web Beacons

Pronto, and/or our business partners, may set and access cookies on your computer and set web beacons on web pages you view. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. A web beacon is a small file placed on a web page that allows a web site to count users who have viewed that page or to access cookies. Cookies and web beacons allow us to personalize your experience and/or gather anonymous information for auditing and reporting purposes. You can choose to disable cookies or remove cookies from your hard drive through your browser, but it may affect how the Pronto Service works when you are browsing the World Wide Web.

  * Log Information.

When you use the Pronto Service, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, information regarding the status of the Software, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, your computer's operating system type, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. This information is necessary for us to provide the Pronto Service to you. We also collect this information to make sure the Software is compatible with your computer and browser, and for our own statistical and reporting purposes.

  * Merchant Web Sites.

We collect specific information about the merchant web sites you visit so that we can provide you with information that may help you make informed purchase decisions. For example, we currently collect, among other things, the name, price, and other information about products you view. When we say "merchant web site", we mean web sites that display and/or sell products, like electronics, home and garden supplies, books, music, clothes, etc. Each time you visit a web site Pronto will detect whether or not that web site is a merchant web site and if we determine that it is NOT a merchant web site, then the Software will NOT collect or send any further information back to Pronto. Some examples of how we use the information we collect from the merchant web sites you visit are as follows:

**Promotional Offers.** If we have a discount or offer for a web site that you visit, we may let you know about that offer or discount when you are on that web site and/or through the Pronto Service.

**Product and Price Comparison.** If you are shopping for a product on a web site, we may let you know if the same product is available from other online merchants and information related to that product. We may also let you know if there are similar products that may be of interest to you.

**Product History.** If you are shopping for a product we will automatically store the name of the product, the price of the product as well other information about that product in your Product History. If we discover that the product later becomes available for a significantly lower price, we may display this information to you. You can delete your Product History at any time by visiting your Product History page and deleting your recently viewed products from your Software. Please note that if you delete a product from your Product History, that product will no longer be associated with you so you will not be able to receive further updates as it relates to those products.




Data Security

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to, or alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data. These measures include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store data. We restrict access to personally identifiable information to Pronto employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our service.

When we share the information we collect

At Pronto, we respect your privacy and personal information. **We do not share any personally identifiable information** with any third parties, without your prior consent, except in these rare circumstances:

  * If we are required by law, regulation, court order or to prevent imminent harm.
  * If the "third-party" is acting on Pronto's behalf as a technology provider. An example of this would be if you request a Price Alert email and Pronto has outsourced the fulfillment of such email requests to a trusted third-party technology provider. 
  * If Pronto should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company, or if Pronto should decide to sell or reorganize some part or all of its business, Pronto may be required to share your personal information with other entities. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Pronto, we will provide notice before any personally identifiable information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. In such event, Pronto will attempt to ensure that your personal information is handled by those other entities in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.



What control you have over the information we collect, store and share

Setting Your Notification Preferences. You may modify or update your notification preferences by visiting the Preferences section of the Pronto Service.

Turning the Software On/Off. 

  * If you are using Internet Explorer, you can turn off the Software by right-clicking your mouse when the mouse cursor is on the Pronto icon in the system tray, usually located in the lower right-hand corner of your computer screen, and selecting the exit option. You may also choose to simply log out of your account through the Pronto web site. When you are logged out of your account Pronto is only able to collect non-personally identifiable information that is anonymous. When you exit, the Pronto icon will no longer appear in the system tray. When the Software is turned off the Software is not collecting any information and is not functioning. You can choose to log back into your account by signing in on the Pronto web site or if the Software is turned off, you can restart the application through the start menu on your computer or by visiting [www.pronto.com](http://www.pronto.com/welcome/index.do). 
  * If you are using the Firefox extension version of the Software, you may log out of your account through the Pronto web site. When you are logged out of your account, Pronto is only able to collect non-personally identifiable information that is anonymous. You can choose to log back into your account by signing in on the Pronto web site. Since the Pronto Firefox extension is tied to the Firefox browser, the only way to exit the Firefox extension is to close the Firefox browser. 



Uninstalling the Software

If you decide you do not want the Software on your computer, you can easily and completely remove all versions by accessing your Preferences and clicking the "Uninstall" button.

  * If you are using Internet Explorer and Microsoft Windows, you can also completely remove the Software through the "Add/Remove Programs" feature. 
  * If you are using the Firefox extension version of the Software, you can also remove the Firefox extension version of the Software from the "Extensions" menu item in the Firefox browser. 



Removing your account.

If you would like to delete your account, you may do so by going to the Contact Us Section of Help and following the instructions to send us an email through the Contact Us email form. Please note that once your account is removed your Product History and Price Alerts will no longer be associated with you and you will no longer have access to them. 

What we do not control

Although the Pronto Service displays the products and services of various merchants, often together with links to those merchants and other web sites, unless expressly stated to the contrary, such display in no way means, implies, suggests or constitutes any relationship or approval of or by those merchants or their products or services. We are not responsible in any way for any other web sites, products, services or information. You acknowledge that your use of any of these web sites, products, services or information is at your own risk. If you want to know about the privacy practices of these other web sites, we recommend that you consult their privacy policies.

Updates and changes to this Privacy Policy

**Notice of Changes.** We may change the provisions of this Privacy Policy at any time. We will always post the date of the latest version of this Privacy Policy at the top of the page. We will let you know that there is a change to this Privacy Policy by putting the word "updated" next to the word "Privacy Policy" at the bottom of each page of the Pronto Service and when you click on your "Help" tab. We encourage you to visit this page from time to time.

**Effect of Changes.** If you maintain your account with us after we have posted a change to this Privacy Policy, then you are bound by the updated terms of the Privacy Policy. In other words, if your account remains active that means that you agree to be bound by the most current version of this Privacy Policy.
