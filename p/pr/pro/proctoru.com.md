## Information Collection and Use

#### Information Collected Upon Registration

When you create or reconfigure a ProctorU account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, the institution with which you will be taking an exam, and email address. Some of this information, for example, your name and the assessment you are scheduled to take, is listed internally in our system and is accessible by your institution. Your use of the service may also result in ProctorU having a stored image of your face, a stored image of the work you perform while connected to ProctorU, or a video capture of your activities while connected with ProctorU. This information is used to verify to your institution that you were the person performing the work and that the work was performed properly.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

Your Consent: We may share or disclose your information with your institution. Use of ProctorU's services explicitly indicates your consent to disclosing your information back to your institution.

We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us. We may share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to obligations mirroring the protections of this privacy policy.

#### Law and Harm

We may disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect ProctorU's rights or property.

#### Business Transfers

In the event that ProctorU is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this privacy policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.
