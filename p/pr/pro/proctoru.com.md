## Information Collection and Use

#### Information Collected Upon Registration

When you create or reconfigure a ProctorU account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, the institution with which you will be taking an exam, credit card number, and email address. Some of this information, for example, your name and the assessment you are scheduled to take, is listed internally in our system and is accessible by your institution. Your use of the service may also result in ProctorU having a stored image of your face, a stored image of the work you perform while connected to ProctorU, or a video capture of your activities while connected with ProctorU. This information is used to verify to your institution that you were the person performing the work and that the work was performed properly.

#### Authentication

You may be asked to authenticate your identity through data services. These questions are generated from a public information database. Upon request, we will provide you the identity of the authentication service we are using for your account in case you wish to review their privacy policy.

#### Log Data

Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, the referring domain, internet service provider (ISP), operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data, and browser plug-ins. 

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. 

We do not link this automatically-collected data to personal information. 

The IP address information we may receive will be the external IP of your ISP and is requested by your partner institution to help troubleshoot issues or verify a general testing location.

#### Tracking Technologies

We ProctorU, affiliates, or analytics or service providers [LogMeIn, Live Chat, Google], use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts, to analyze trends, administer the website, tracking users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis. 

We use cookies to remember users’ settings. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our website, but your ability to use some features or areas of our website may be limited. 

We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.

You will continue to receive generic ads.

Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity also use HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.

#### Third Party Services
