Propertywide.co.uk offers location-enabled services, such as “Use my location” button when visiting our web site from a mobile browser or using Propertywide for Windows Phone 7, iPhone and Android apps. If you use those services, we may receive information about your actual location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to approximate a location and pre-populate search field with that location, and provide a list of local agents and properties for sale or rent. This location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is discarded immediately after use and is not stored in any way or for any length of time.

Depending on the mobile device you use, you will be asked when you use the location services for the first time.

In Propertywide for Windows Phone 7 app you can disable the “Use my location” button at any time by using the information (i) button on your Windows Phone 7 handset and de-selecting the ‘Use my location’ option.
