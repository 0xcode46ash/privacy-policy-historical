# Privacy Policy | Project Nursery

Welcome to Projectnursery.com,  a service provided by Project Nursery, LLC (“Project Nursery”). Our Online Privacy Policy is our commitment to serve you and to protect your privacy online.

From time to time, Project Nursery may change this Privacy Policy. The updated Privacy Policy will be posted on the Site, so that you will always be aware of what information Project Nursery collects and how it is used. You should review the Privacy Policy periodically to see if any changes have been made. This Privacy Policy was last modified on January 1, 2010.

**About Children.** The Site is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information via the Site from visitors in this age group. We do, however, collect information about children and babies from their parents. We ask that our users not provide information about a baby or child without first getting the parents’ consent. We encourage parents to talk to their children about their use of the Internet and the information they disclose to Web sites.

**Access to Community Photo Gallery (GALLERY).** The Site contains a social networking community for expectant parents (“Gallery”). In order to join the Project Nursery community, or use any of the community, interactive, or customized features of the Site, you must first complete the registration form and create a user name and password. During registration you are required to give information including but not limited to your name, email address, and zip code (all such personally identifiable information, “Personal Information”).

If you choose to join the Project Nursery community, you will be able to create a PROFILE PAGE. This page contains your user name zip code and state of residence. All other information you add to this page is optional and at your own discretion, including the ability to share photos.

The Personal Information you enter into your PROFILE PAGE will be available to other members of the Site. You will have options that control sharing your Personal Information on your PROFILE PAGE. You can select/modify these options in USER: YOUR PROFILE.

**Uses of Information.** The Personal Information you input when you register for the Site is used to confirm your membership and assign you a password. You will receive an email after registering to confirm your membership. Please click on the link provided to activate your account.

If you opt to receive future communication from Project Nursery and/or our partners, your email address will be used to deliver electronic communication. Any demographic information you input is used to understand our member demographics, so that we can improve the Site for our members. Unless you opted to receive information from Project Nursery’s partner sites, your information will not be shared with any organizations or companies under any circumstance, within the limits of the law.

If at any point you wish to not receive any emails or other communication from Project Nursery, and/or its partners, please let us know by sending us an e-mail or simply choose to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe button at the bottom of the email.

**Forums.** You may opt to post messages on our Forums. Be aware that members of Project Nursery and other users of the Site can view this information. Any Personal Information that is posted on the forums is your responsibility and may result in unsolicited messages from unknown people. You are encouraged to exercise discretion when providing Personal Information in and through the forums. Project Nursery takes no responsibility for any information posted on the forums. If you find anything posted on the Site to be inappropriate, please send details about the posting, including the page on which you saw it and the URL in an email with the words “Inappropriate Web Content” in the subject line. Project Nursery reserves the right to discontinue any person’s account if the account violates the Terms of Use.

**Contests and Surveys.** We may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests and surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain Personal Information from you. Participation in these contests and surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested Personal Information typically includes contact information (such as name and email address), and demographic information (such as zip code and gender). We may use this Personal Information to improve your experience on the site by better matching Project Nursery’s offerings with its users. We may use a third party service provider to conduct these contests and surveys; that company will be prohibited from using our users’ Personal Information for any other purpose. We will not share the Personal Information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and you consent to such use.

**Invite Friends.** If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. Project Nursery will send this one-time email and will not store your friend’s email address.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure.** We share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners and/or advertisers and/or investors. This information does not identify individual users. We may use it learn about the geographic location of our users or other ways to make the experience better for you. We will also use it to report aggregate statistics on site utilization to the investors and/or partners and advertisers in order to improve the user experience and to better enable Project Nursery to continue offering the Site.

**Service Providers.** We may use an outside company to maintain the back end of the Site. This company does not retain, share, store, or use Personal Information for any other purposes.

**Log Files.** As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. We use this information – which does not identify individual users – to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information. We use a third-party tracking service [Google Analytics] that uses cookies [log files] to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to the Site in the aggregate (i.e. user paths, entrance pages, exit pages, most visited pages, most clicked links) to help us understand better visitor behavior on the Site so we can improve the Site’s user interface and provide additional content in content categories that are most popular amongst Site users.

**Cookies.** A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this Site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any Personal Information you submit while on the Site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Site. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. If you reject cookies, you may still use the Site, but your ability to use some areas of our Site may be limited.

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers, content partners) may use cookies on the Site or on pages that we link to. We have no access to or control over these cookies. See “Third Party Advertisers.” This privacy statement covers the use of cookies on the Site only and does not cover the use of cookies by other sites whose material is displayed on/or linked to this Site.

**Third Party Advertisers.** The Site displays various sized rotating advertising banners and/or buttons. We share aggregate information only with those organizations/companies to let them know if their advertisement is being “clicked.”

**Links to Other Sites.** This Site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Project Nursery. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites. Links to other sites do not signify our endorsing their information. Project Nursery will not give any of your Personal Information to the owners / administrators of these linked sites. However, if you decide to give any identifying information to the sponsors of these sites (for example purchasing an item) be advised that Project Nursery is not responsible for the ways in which the owners / administrators of these linked sites use the information that you give to them. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.

**Legal Disclaimer.** Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order, or legal process served on the Site.

**Clear GIFs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs).** We may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please let us know by sending us an e-mail or simply choose to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe button at the bottom of the email.

**Security.** The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Business Transitions.** In the event Project Nursery goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email of any such change in ownership or control of your Personal Information.
