Proflowers Privacy Policy

This is the web site of Proflowers.com. 

We can be reached [via email](http://www10.proflowers.com/cfm/contactUs.cfm?lng=&REF=). 

For each visitor to our Web site, our computers automatically recognize the consumer's domain name and IP address, but not the email address. We collect only the domain name and IP address of visitors to our web page, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit and information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations. For each customer (defined as a visitor that successfully consummates a sale), we store the data necessary to fulfill the order. 

The information we collect is used to improve the content and navigation of our site, to customize the content and/or layout of the page to each individual consumer for maximum experience value, to notify consumers about updates to our Web site, to complete user-initiated transactions, to trace false orders, and to contact consumers for marketing purposes, if they so desire and explicitly give permission. 

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES. 

If you do not want to receive email from us in the future, please let us know by sending email to us at the above address and telling us that you do not want to receive email from our company or follow the instructions provided in each email to you. 

Persons who supply us with their telephone number(s) or email address may receive telephone calls or email from us with information or requests for information regarding orders they have placed online. For your benefit, please provide us with your correct phone number(s) and/or email address. 

Proflowers Sender Privacy Policy

This is the course of action we will take if a flower recipient calls us to ask who the sender was. 

  * If we get a request from a recipient asking who sent an arrangement we will give the name on the gift message. 
  * If there was no gift message filled out or if there was no name on the gift message, we will ask the sender. 
  * If we get approval from the sender, we will then inform the recipient. 
  * If the sender does not reply or if the sender denies permission, then we will not reveal the sender. 

Rider to Privacy Policy

In some cases, visitors may arrive at and purchase flowers from us through a link from one of our "Affiliate's" web sites. We pay each Affiliate a commission, or a portion of the sales made to those who link to us from the Affiliate's site. 

Some of our Affiliates run a "rewards" or "charity" program (the "Programs"). Under such programs, internet users receive credits based on the commissions an Affiliate receives from sites such as ours. Participants in such programs either can donate their credits to a chosen charitable organization, or keep them for their own use and benefit. If you are a Participant in such programs, we may share certain personal information (your name and e-mail address), as well as information regarding the dollar amount of your purchases, to Be Free, Inc ("Be Free"). Be Free is a third party which collects data necessary for Affiliates to credit Participants with purchases made under their programs. We will send your name and e-mail address to Be Free only if you make a purchase from us and if you are a Participant in such programs. 

Under no circumstances will we share personal information regarding any of our visitors (name, e-mail address, phone number, etc.) with any third party unless authorized by you to do so. 

We require that children consult with their parents and obtain consent before providing any data about themselves, their purchasing profile or their families. In an effort to ensure that we do not gather personal information from children, we require that all individuals provide a valid credit card number before completing a purchase order. We also recommend that children provide the personal information of their parent or guardian rather than themselves.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE WILL WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES
