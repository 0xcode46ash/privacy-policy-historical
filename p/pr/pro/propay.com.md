## THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES ONLY TO THOSE  
PEOPLE LIVING WITHIN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

## Required Information

We obtain information about you from a variety of sources. You provide information about yourself, for example, by completing the ProPay Account sign-up form. This form asks for your first and last name, e-mail address, mailing address, day and evening telephone number, Social Security number, date of birth and the creation of your unique password. Information about you may also be obtained from credit-reporting agencies, ProPay Affiliates, other third-party commercial vendors to financial services firms, and/or your use of ProPay's services. We call this information, "Merchant Account Information." Merchant Account Information is used to identify you, prevent possible fraud, and in connection to delivering ProPay Account services to you. Unique identifier information is used to qualify for, and set up, a ProPay Account. Refusal to fully complete the sign-up form by entering accurate information will result in ProPay not being able to provide services to you. Credit card and checking account information is required to use specific services of ProPay and is used only to process those transactions you have initiated. Also, personal information from third parties may be collected by ProPay on behalf of merchants from the third parties with whom the merchant engages in business as a result of their connection with ProPay.  This third party personal information may include, but is not limited to, contact information of the third party, such as name, address, and social security number, as well as credit card information.  In the event this information is requested of the third party and collected by ProPay, ProPay shall only use this information pursuant to the purposes delineated and contemplated by this Privacy Policy as further set forth herein. 

## Disclosure of Information

We use Merchant Account Information in connection with delivering payment services to you. In order to conduct financial payment-related transactions and/or to effectively deliver payment services securely to you, while minimizing the risks of financial loss, it is often necessary to communicate such Merchant Account Information to or with financial institutions such as Visa, MasterCard, Discover Card Services, banking institutions involved in supporting, clearing or settling payment-related transactions, our corporate Affiliates and/or other companies we work with. ProPay takes numerous commercially reasonable measures to protect the personal information that you share. In the event your Merchant Account becomes delinquent, you authorize ProPay to disclose and communicate all your Merchant Account Information to third parties for the purpose of collection of any delinquent amount. If you initiate a transaction that requires credit card and checking account information, ProPay uses that information only to process your payment request and will not use it for marketing purposes. ProPay may also disclose information as permitted by law to governmental regulatory agencies. For example, we may disclose Merchant Account Information in response to lawful subpoenas, to credit-reporting agencies, and to help prevent fraud. Any third party, including by way of example and not limitation, service providers or agents, or processors with whom ProPay shares your personal information shall only be permitted to use this personal information for the purposes set forth above and which are contemplated by this Privacy Policy.  The types of third parties with whom ProPay shares your personal information shall be limited to those delineated in the foregoing, and your personal information shall not be shared with third parties which fall outside the scope of this Privacy Policy.

## Security

We take commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural steps to help safeguard your Merchant Account Information. Our web site takes precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the web site, we take reasonable commercial measures to protect your information both online and off-line.   
When the registration form or a transaction form asks you to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number, checking account information, and/or your Social Security number), that information is electronically encrypted and is protected. While on a secure page, such as the registration form or transaction forms, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer, becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about ProPay's VeriSign certificate, please click here.   
While we use VeriSign encryption to protect sensitive information transferred online, we also take additional reasonable commercial measures to protect your information offline. All your information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (such as ProPay's database administrators, security department employees, and customer service representatives) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Periodically, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance of privacy and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. The servers that store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.   
If you have any questions about the security at ProPay's web site, please contact us at ProPay [Customer Service](https://web.archive.org/customerservice/). 

## Cookies

ProPay's web site uses cookies to track referrals from their Affiliates who have joined an affiliate program. During login a user may also choose to have ProPay store the user email address in a cookie to facilitate subsequent logins.

## Links

ProPay's web site may contain links to other web sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other web sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the ProPay web site and to read the privacy statement of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site. 

## E-mail Links

ProPay uses e-mail links located on the "contact us" page to allow you to contact us directly with any questions or comments. We read every message sent in and try to reply promptly to every one. This information is used to respond directly to your questions or comments. We may also file your comments to improve the web site and program or may review and discard the information. 

## Referral Program

When available, if you elect to use the ProPay referral service for informing a friend about ProPay, we will ask you for the friend's name and e-mail address. We will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit the web site and register for the service. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail. 

## Newsletter, Promotions and Correspondence 

ProPay sends all new members a welcoming e-mail. By registering with ProPay, you also agree to receive e-mail notifications and confirmations that are not optional (such as transaction details, changes made to your profile, etc.) when using our payment systems. Established members will receive information on special promotions and a newsletter, including product and service updates. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please refer to the "Opting Out" section below.   
We may occasionally present a special promotion. To qualify for entry, we may ask you to provide personal information. If we plan to share that information with any sponsor(s), we will inform you of that intent in the specific newsletter or promotion. 

## Opting Out

You are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of receiving further information from ProPay about special promotions or product updates. The registration form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so you can choose whether you want marketing material or product updates. If you no longer wish to receive service updates or promotional materials from ProPay, you may opt-out of receiving these communications by editing your ProPay Account profile after you have logged into your account. Also, you have the option to opt-out from taking receipt of notifications and promotional information sent to you via email by ProPay.  You may elect to do so, and thereby unsubscribe from email correspondence, by simply following the unsubscribe instructions which will be provided in each email correspondence sent to you by ProPay.

## Surveys

From time-to-time we may request information from you via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information and demographic information. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of our service and/or this web site. 

## Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will notify you via your current e-mail address on file with ProPay so you are always aware of what information is collected, how it is used, and under which circumstances, if any, information is disclosed. If at any time we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from what is stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you by way of an e-mail. 

## Former Customers

If you cancel your ProPay Merchant Account or your ProPay Merchant Account is closed, we will continue to treat and safeguard Merchant Account Information about you as described in this Notice. 

## For Vermont Account Holders Only

If your ProPay Merchant Account has a Vermont billing address, we will automatically treat your account as if you had opted out as set forth in this notice. We may share your name and contact information, and information about our transactions or experiences with you, with credit reporting agencies. 

## How to Access and Update Your Personal Information

You may access your personal information by clicking the Edit My Profile link after you log on to your ProPay Account. You may also make any necessary changes there. You can help ProPay maintain the accuracy of your personal information by updating your personal profile when you change your e-mail address, mailing address, or phone numbers.
