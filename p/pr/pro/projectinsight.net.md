# Project Insight Privacy Statement

|  | 

Metafuse has created this privacy statement ("Statement") in order to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Privacy within the Project Insightâ„¢ Website is of great importance to us. Because we gather important information from our visitors and customers, we have established this Statement as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices. We reserve the right to change this Statement and will provide notification of the change at least thirty (30) business days prior to the change taking effect. 

## Collected Information

We require customers who register to use the services ("Services") offered on our website to give us contact information, such as their name, company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the number of users within the organization that will be using the Services. 

At the time you express interest in attaining additional information, or when you register for the service, we may also ask for additional personal information, such as title, department name, fax number, or additional company information, such as annual revenues, number of employees, or industry. Customers can opt out of providing this additional information by not entering it when asked. Customers can update or remove their personal information at any time by logging into the website and editing their personal information within the Administration, Users section. Customers can view their updated profiles to confirm the edits have been made. 

Metafuse uses the information that we collect to set up Services for individuals and their organizations. We may also use the information to contact customers in order to discuss customer interest in our company, the Services that we provide, and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as promotions and events. Customers are asked to provide an email address when registering for the Service in order to receive a username and password. We may email information regarding updates to the Service or company, or may also send a customer newsletter. Customer email addresses and any personal customer information will not be distributed or shared with any third parties. Customers can opt out of being contacted by us, or receiving such information from us, at any time by calling 949 476 6499. 

Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information, or as provided for in the Metafuse Terms of Use, we do not disclose to any third-party the information provided. All financial and billing information that we collect through the website is used solely to check the qualifications of prospective customers and to bill for Services. This billing information is not used by Metafuse for third-party marketing or promotional purposes. 

Metafuse uses a third-party intermediary to manage the credit card processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing. Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide content on the website but they are not permitted to collect any information nor does Metafuse share any user information with these parties. 

Customers of the Service will be using the website to host data and information ("Data"). Metafuse will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such Data except as provided in the Metafuse Terms of Use, or as may be required by law. Individual records may at times be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue, or suspected violation of the Terms of Use, or as may be required by law. Customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their user registration and password. 

Metafuse may also collect certain information from visitors to, and customers of the website, such as Internet addresses.

## Cookies

When you interact with your Metafuse website we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful. When you come to your website, our Web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether customers and visitors have visited the website previously. 

Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Metafuse, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or registering for a 'test drive,' you remain anonymous to Metafuse. Cookies come in two forms: session and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. They include such information as a unique identifier for your browser. 

Metafuse uses session cookies containing encrypted or encoded information including your username and session ID. This information allows Metafuse to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies help us make sure you are who you say you are after you have logged in and are required in order to use the Metafuse application. Metafuse uses persistent cookies that only Metafuse can read and use, to identify the fact that you are a Metafuse customer or prior Metafuse website visitor (whatever the case may be). We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. Users who disable their web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our website but will not be able to successfully use our service. 

## Third-Party Sites

The website may contain links to other websites. These websites could contain links that users input in the system as well. Metafuse is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other websites. Customers and visitors will need to check the policy statements of these other web sites to understand their policies. Customers and visitors who access a linked site may be disclosing their private information. It is the responsibility of the user to keep such information private and confidential. 

## Security

Our website has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the data under our control. When our website is accessed using Netscape Navigator, or Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 6.0 or higher, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology can be applied to further protect information using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure that data is safe, secure, and available only to you. Metafuse also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and hosts the website in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. Finally, Metafuse provides unique user names and passwords that must be entered each time a customer logs on. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of data. 

## Opt-Out Policy

Metafuse offers its visitors and customers a means to choose how we may use information provided. If, at any time after registering for information or ordering Services, you change your mind about receiving information from us or about sharing your information with third parties, send us a request specifying your new choice. Simply send your request on the request for information form.
