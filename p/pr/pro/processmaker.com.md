# ProcessMaker - Privacy Statement

* * *

**2) Unless you choose otherwise, ProcessMaker® shares information about you only on a basis that does not personally identify you.**  
In order to improve our Service, provide content and develop applications and services that are useful to our Subscribing Organizations, and Members, ProcessMaker® automatically gathers information on an aggregate basis about the applications and services Members use. A Subscribing Organization's or its Member's personally identifiable information cannot be linked to any of this information. ProcessMaker® also uses demographic information and profile data about Subscribing Organizations and Members for these purposes. [

**3) We use industry-standard technology and other means to keep your information as secure as possible.**  
At ProcessMaker®, we know the security of your site and data is an important issue for you. ProcessMaker® exercises great care to secure your personally identifiable information and Site Information, and has implemented security measures in accordance with industry-standard practice. ProcessMaker® uses multi-layered security to protect your intranet site, and we are continuously engaged in examining and updating security as we update our Service.

Internally, we restrict access to all personally identifiable information and Site Information to employees who need access to the information in order to do their jobs. These employees are limited in number, and are committed to our privacy and security policies. All such employees execute comprehensive nondisclosure agreements, which provide explicit confidentiality protections. Any employee who violates our privacy and/or security policies is subject to possible termination of contract and civil/criminal prosecution.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure, and there is a slight risk that data could be intercepted or interrupted during Internet transmission. We strive to provide secure transmission of Subscribing Organization information, Member personally identifiable information, and all Site Information (from the Member's computer to ProcessMaker's servers). However, ProcessMaker® cannot warrant the security of any information that Subscribing Organizations or Members transmit to us from our online services or store on the Sites. Therefore Subscribing Organizations and Members do so at their own risk.

**4) We give you certain choices concerning the collection and use of information about you.**  
Except for a few specific instances, Subscribing Organizations and Members may always elect : 

• not to transmit any personally identifiable information, to use or receive any Service for which a fee is charged, special service, product, discount, or promotional communications from ProcessMaker® or our Third Party Providers

• to decline or not use services that require them to transmit certain information to our Third Party Providers

• to remove their personally identifiable information from the Site, or

• to discontinue the Site use and have all information deleted

Subscribing Organizations and Members can exercise some of these options by telling us during the registration process or when they choose to receive or use a specific advertisement, service or product. Subscribing Organizations and Members can notify us of a change in their registration options by sending an email to [info@colosa.com](mailto:info@colosa.com), or writing to Colosa Inc., 2655 Le Jeune Rd., Suite 1112, Coral Gables, FL 33134 USA.

If information is being collected by any entity other than a Third Party Provider or if it will be disclosed by ProcessMaker® in any manner not described in this Privacy Statement, Subscribing Organizations and Members will be given prior notice, and can always elect not to use that particular service or provide the Information.

If a Subscribing Organization discontinues its Site use, all the personally identifiable information of the Subscribing Organization and its Members will be removed from our databases (other than in aggregate form), and the Site and all of its Site Information will be removed and/or deleted from our servers.

A Subscribing Organization or Member may update or modify any of its personally identifiable information by using the Users tab in their ProcessMaker® Site. For further assistance with this, Members may send an email to [info@colosa.com](mailto:info@colosa.com)To ask any questions about this Privacy Statement, the practices of this Website, our Services, or make any suggestions or tell us about any other ideas concerning our Website or our Services, please contact:
