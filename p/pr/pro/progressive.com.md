**What personal information does Progressive collect about me?**

Progressive collects information necessary to underwrite and provide accurate insurance rates when requested, and to maintain and improve customer service. 

Visitors to Progressive's Web site browse the site anonymously. Visitors are not required to provide any personal information to Progressive in order to access our Web site. 

Progressive requests personal information about you, others in your household and your vehicles to provide an accurate insurance rate for Progressive and up to three other leading insurance carriers. When you request rates, Progressive always asks for your name and e-mail address. Depending upon your state of residence, the information requested could include examples such as: 

| Zipcode | Record of Financial responsibility  
---|---  
Date of birth | Employment duration  
Gender | Distance driven  
Marital status | Vehicle(s)  
Prior insurance carrier | Vehicle attributes  
Policy expiration date | Primary use of vehicles  
Home ownership | Number of drivers and their driving record  
Length of residency |   
  
It is not our practice to request personal information in connection with your insurance transaction solely for marketing purposes. However, non-identifying information, and information collected when you participate in contests and surveys, may be used for marketing purposes. 

Progressive asks for additional information if you decide to purchase a policy, including credit card number, address, social security number, telephone number, drivers license number, and loss payee, if necessary. Social Security information is optional in some states.
