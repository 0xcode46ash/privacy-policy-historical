### What Members Can Do to Help

Provident Credit Union and its affiliates are committed to protecting the privacy of its members and customers. You can help by following these simple guidelines:

  * Use caution when disclosing your account numbers, social security numbers, etc. to other persons. If someone calls you, explains the call is on behalf of the Credit Union, and asks for your account number, you should beware. Official credit union staff will have access to your information and will not need to ask for it.
  * Keep your information current. It is important that we have current information on how to reach you. If we detect potentially fraudulent or unauthorized activity or use of an account, we will attempt to contact you immediately. If your address or phone number changes, please let us know.
  * Let us know if you have questions. Please do not hesitate to call us -- we are here to serve you!
