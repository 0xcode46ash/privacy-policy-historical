## **Online Privacy Policy**

### Effective July 21, 2014

Protective Life recognizes that protecting the privacy and security of personal information is an important responsibility. This Online Privacy Policy notice tells you how we treat personal information that you share with us online, and the measures we take to safeguard that information. 

This notice refers to Protective Life and its affiliated companies using the terms "we," "us," and "our." 

### Using Our Websites and Sharing Personal Information with Us

You can access extensive information about our products on our websites and social media sites without sharing any personal information with us. 

We may also provide online tools and resources that allow you to share personal information with us. Those tools and resources are designed to use personal information so that we can give you a personalized response to an inquiry, or provide you with information about services and products that may meet your needs. When you share personal information with us for these purposes, we may share that information with our affiliates, or with other companies who help us respond to your questions or market our own products to you. We will not share personal information with anyone else unless we have your permission, or we are allowed or required by law to disclose it. 

### How We Safeguard Personal Information

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect personal information.

Any personal information you provide to us on our website is encrypted during transmission and then stored on a secure server. 

We require that our service providers limit their use of the information we share and keep it confidential.
