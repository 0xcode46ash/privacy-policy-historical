## Privacy Notice

PROTECTIVE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY

 Protecting the privacy of information about our customers is important. This notice tells you how we treat information about our customers. We treat information about our former customers the same as we treat information about our current customers.

We do not sell information about our customers. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect it. Access to customer information is limited to people who need access to do their jobs.

We get most of the information we need from customer applications and other forms. If a customer authorizes it, we may get information from others. For example, when a person applies for life insurance we may ask for permission to get information from:

  * Insurance support organizations such as the Medical Information Bureau and 
  * Consumer reporting agencies



We also get information as we process customer transactions. The information we may have includes:

INFORMATION such as:

  * Name 
  * Address

  * Demographic Data



FINANCIAL INFORMATION such as:

  * Income, Assets 
  * Other Insurance Products



HEALTH INFORMATION such as: 

  * Medical history 
  * Other factors affecting insurability



We use the information for business purposes, such as:

  * processing applications and claims 
  * servicing your business 
  * offering you other products and services



We share the information with others who provide services to help us process or administer our business. For example, we may share information with:

  * a company that prints our customer statements 
  * medical examiners who help us underwrite life insurance applications
  * service providers who help us process claims 



We require that our service providers limit their use of the information and keep it confidential. We will not share information with anyone else unless:

  * we have the customer’s permission 
  * we are allowed or required by law to disclose it 



You should know that your insurance sales agent is independent. The use and security of information an agent gets is his or her responsibility. Please contact your agent if you have questions about his or her privacy policy.
