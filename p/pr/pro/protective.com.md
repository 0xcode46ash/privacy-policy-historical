# Protective Life: Privacy Policy

## ****

**Effective July  17** **, 2013**  

Protective Life recognizes that protecting the privacy and security of personal information is an important responsibility. This Online Privacy Policy notice tells you how we treat personal information that you share with us online, and the measures we take to safeguard that information.

This notice refers to Protective Life and its affiliated companies using the terms "we," "us," and "our."   

**Using Our Websites and Sharing Personal Information with Us**  

You can access extensive information about our products on our websites and social media sites without sharing any personal information with us.   

We may also provide online tools and resources that allow you to share personal information with us.  Those tools and resources are designed to use personal information so that we can give you a personalized response to an inquiry, or provide you with information about services and products that may meet your needs.  When you share personal information with us for these purposes, we may share that information with our affiliates, or with other companies who help us respond to your questions or market our own products to you.  We will not share personal information with anyone else unless we have your permission, or we are allowed or required by law to disclose it.

**How We Safeguard Personal Information**  

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect personal information.  Any personal information you provide to us on our website is encrypted during transmission and then stored on a secure server.    

We require that our service providers limit their use of the information we share and keep it confidential.

**Limited Anonymous Information We Receive from Visitors to Our Websites**  

Like many websites, we collect some information about our users and their website use experience that is not personal information.  For example, some websites and pages within our sites use "cookies."  A cookie is a small file that is stored on your hard drive and contains no personally identifiable information about you or your usage of our websites.  A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive or read cookie files created from other websites.  You are free to decline our cookie if your browser has been set to prompt or decline cookies.   

We may also collect similar anonymous data using web beacons or other tracking or targeting mechanisms.  Like cookies, these technologies do not collect or transmit personal information.

**Linked Internet Websites**  

We may provide links to other websites, including the websites of our subsidiaries, affiliates, and third parties whose information we believe you may find useful.  When you leave our website and go to a linked website, your use of that website is subject to the privacy policy of that website.  We recommend you review the privacy policy of any linked website.

**Keeping Up To Date with our Online Privacy Policy**  

We have the right to change our Online Privacy Policy.  If we make a material change to this policy, we will post a notification on our website before we put the change into effect.
