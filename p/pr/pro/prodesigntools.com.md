# Privacy Policy | ProDesignTools

Thank you for visiting our website. The privacy of our customers is important to us, and our Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect and use the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our site and our products and services. We never sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties, unless exceptionally required by law.

## What Information Do We Collect?

When you visit our website you may provide us with two types of information: (1) optional personal information you choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis, which is used solely for correspondence you have specifically requested or regarding comments you have left, and (2) website usage information that is collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our site, which is used solely to measure site traffic and visitor statistics.

## Log Files

As with most websites, this site uses log files. Data automatically collected by log files includes IP (Internet protocol) addresses, browser types, Internet Service Providers (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform types, date/time stamps, and the number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track traffic movement, and to gather broad demographic information. The data in log files is not linked to any personally identifiable information.

## Cookies

Cookies are parcels of text commonly sent by a website to a browser, which often include an anonymous unique identifier. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. We may use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site, or other data to improve overall experience. Linked sites may use cookies for logins, tracking, statistics or other purposes.

## Email Information

You can sign up to receive occasional news of future Adobe discounts and coupon savings by providing your email address in the “Special Offers” box. Our newsletter aims to detail new Adobe products and help you save money on Adobe products generally. In each newsletter there is a direct link to unsubscribe if you no longer wish to receive future mailings, and your information would be removed permanently from our subscriber list. If you would otherwise like to modify or remove the email address stored for a newsletter subscription, please simply let us know via [our contact form](http://prodesigntools.com/contact-us.html).

Our site’s content, including comments, is regularly indexed by search bots and, therefore, has the potential to be read, printed, and otherwise distributed around the world without the commenter’s consent. Within each comment, the publicly visible fields are Name, Website, and the content of the comment itself. Commenters agree not to hold our site liable for any unintended use of any comments they post. If you chose to post a comment on the site, you concurrently make certain concessions to publicity and, therefore, limit your personal privacy and that of your post. Nevertheless, we will never collect, sell, or otherwise distribute user information (such as email addresses) that isn’t otherwise publicly available on the site without the permission of the user(s). Just as our editors maintain the right to delete or edit any comment at any time for any reason they deem appropriate, any user may request his/her comments be deleted at any time for any reason s/he deems appropriate. Any requests for comment removal should be made via [our contact form](http://prodesigntools.com/contact-us.html).

## Partners

As official partners of Adobe, Amazon.com, Lynda.com, Kelby Training, and other companies, we may display affiliated links or receive revenues from product or service commissions. As members of the Google AdSense network, we may receive revenues from the display of banner advertising. 10% of any earnings from these will be donated to Charity. However, we do not share any site data or personally-identifying infor­mation with these partners or any other entities.

## Sharing Information with Third Parties

We do not sell, rent, or share website data or personal information with any other parties, unless exceptionally required by law.

## Commitment to Data Security

We take strong technical and organizational precautions to keep your personally identifiable information secure and confidential, to prevent any loss, misuse, or alteration. Only select authorized employees have access to this information, which is safeguarded with AES encryption and strong password protection. All emails and newsletters from this site allow you to opt out of further mailings.

## Your Consent

By using our website you consent the practices described in this privacy policy. These practices may be changed, but any changes will be posted at this location. You are encouraged to review the privacy policy whenever you visit our site to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.

Please see also our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-and-conditions.html), which together govern our relationship with you in relation to this website.
