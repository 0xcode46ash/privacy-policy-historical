Information this Site Gathers/Tracks

**Statistics about your visit**

As you browse the site, Progress Software's Web servers collect information about your visit, not about you personally. Via Web server logs, we monitor statistics such as:

  * How many people visit our site
  * Which pages people visit on our site
  * From which domains our visitors come (e.g., "yahoo.com" or "aol.com")
  * Which browsers people use to visit our site



While we gather this information, none of it is associated with you as an individual. We use these statistics to improve our Web site, to monitor its performance, and to make it easier for you and other visitors to use.

**Organizational and Personal information you knowingly give us**

Within www.progess.com, you may be asked to give us personal or organizational information in order to purchase or receive information about a product or service. This information may range from your generic zip code, to your specific phone number, account number, credit card number, e-mail address, organization URL and mailing address.

Use of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks

**Your IP Address and Host Name**

Progress Software's Web sites log Host Names and IP addresses when the Host Name is not available) for systems administration and security purposes. These logs are monitored and analyzed to maintain systems and information security and allow us to constantly improve the value and the availability of the Web content.

**Progress Software Registration Forms**

We encourage all visitors to register with progress.com, although registration is not required, except for access to our premium content areas. The registration forms require users to give us accurate contact information (like name and email address) and references that help us better serve you. Your name and email address may be used to send you information about our company, product updates, special offers, and newsletters. You may always remove your name entirely from databases.

**Order Forms and Enrollment Forms**

Our order forms securely collect visitor's contact information and financial information (like your credit card number and other billing information). Contact information on the order form is used for order fulfillment and may be shared with our Partners or Resellers if that is necessary to fulfill your request. The information that we require in our order form is only used to process your order quickly and accurately. Your contact information will only be used to send you the product that you purchase and your billing information will only be used to bill you for that product. During the purchasing process, you may be given the opportunity to sign up for future e-mailings regarding our products, services, and promotions. If you sign up, Progress Software will share your contact information with other Progress Software partner companies only, not with other outside companies.

As Progress Software's online systems become more sophisticated, you may also be given the option of registering a profile with Progress Software. This would store your name, purchase history, and billing information to make it easier for you to shop and purchase products/services from us in the future. Once profiling is available, you may opt out of this feature at any time by changing / canceling your profile online.
