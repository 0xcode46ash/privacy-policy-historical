# Privacy Policy | Progress Software

**Last update: Monday, October 4, 2004**

We at Progress Software Corporation ("Progress Software") are constantly striving to provide excellent service to you, our customers and business partners, while building a long-lasting relationship with you. To achieve these goals, we occasionally need information about you when you visit our site.

When you visit our web sites, you might be providing information about your visit on two levels:

  * Statistics collected as you browse our Web sites.
  * Organizational and personal information you knowingly give us.



Because Progress Software respects your right to privacy, we want you to be aware of how we handle this information.

## Our Commitment to Your Privacy

Progress Software assures you that we do not

  * Provide or sell the names and addresses of our customers [site users] to outside vendors.



Progress Software does:

  * Safeguard customers' information from unauthorized access.
  * Collect, maintain and use customer information as necessary to provide the most helpful and targeted products and services to meet customers' needs (e.g. customer care or new products or services).
  * Honor customers' requests to remove their names from our telephone or mail solicitation lists in a timely manner. Just [Contact Us](mailto:unsubscribe@progress.com).
  * Maintain confidentiality of customer information when undertaking projects with other companies.



Progress Software has always valued your privacy, and we reinforce this belief throughout our organization. Your information will be protected as described unless the specific Web page says otherwise. If you have further questions about our privacy policy, please [Contact Us](mailto:generalcounsel@progress.com).

## Information this Site Gathers/Tracks

**Statistics Collected as You Browse Our Web Sites**

As you browse our Web sites, Progress Software's Web servers collect information about your visit, not about you personally. Via Web server logs, we monitor statistics such as:

  * How many people visit our Web sites.
  * Which pages people visit on our Web sites.
  * From which domains our visitors come (e.g., "yahoo.com" or "aol.com").
  * Which browsers people use to visit our Web sites.



While we gather this information, none of it is associated with you as an individual. We use these statistics to improve our Web sites, to monitor their performance, and to make it easier for you and other visitors to use.

**Organizational and Personal Information You Knowingly Give Us**

Within our Web sites, you may be asked to give us personal or organizational information in order to purchase or receive information about a product or service. This information may range from your generic zip code, to your specific phone number, product serial numbers and control codes, account number, credit card number, e-mail address, organization URL, or mailing address.

## Use of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks

**Your IP Address and Host Name**  
Progress Software's Web sites log Host Names (or IP addresses when the Host Name is not available) for systems administration and security purposes. These logs are monitored and analyzed to maintain systems and information security and allow us to constantly improve the value and the availability of the Web content.

**Registration Forms**  
We encourage all visitors to register with Progress Software, although registration is not required, except for access to our premium content areas. The registration forms require users to give us accurate contact information (like name and email address) and references that help us better serve you. Your name and email address may be used to send you information about our company, product updates, special offers, and newsletters. To opt out of receiving communications from Progress Software, please [Contact Us](mailto:unsubscribe@progress.com).

**Order Forms and Enrollment Forms**  
Our order forms securely collect visitor's contact information and financial information (like your credit card number and other billing information).Contact information on the order form is used for order fulfillment and may be shared with our Partners or Resellers if that is necessary to fulfill your request. The information that we require in our order form is only used to process your order quickly and accurately. Your contact information will only be used to send you the product that you purchase and your billing information will only be used to bill you for that product. During the purchasing process, you may be given the opportunity to sign up for future e-mailings regarding our products, services, and promotions. If you sign up, Progress Software will share your contact information with other Progress Software partner companies only, not with other outside companies.

You may also be given the option of registering a profile with Progress Software which would store your name, purchase history, and billing information to make it easier for you to shop and purchase products/services from us in the future. You may opt out of this feature at any time by changing/canceling your profile online.
