### Cookies

A "cookie" is a test file that is placed in the browser files of your computer when you visit a website. The cookie enables us to relate your use of our website to information that you specifically and knowingly provided to us. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service and to provide content we believe would be of interest to you. Additionally we track usage statistics to better understand how people interact with our site. Cookies do not collect personally identifiable information; the information collected is in an aggregate, non-identifiable form.

We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.

### Use of Information

By filling out information on our website as part of a request for information about insurance policies and quotations, you authorize us to provide that information to various insurance companies, insurance agents and other related third parties that participate in our insurance quote network (collectively "Insurance Providers"). The Insurance Providers may provide your personal information to their insurance carriers, suppliers and other related vendors in order to generate price quotations and information relevant to insurance policies that you have requested, and the Insurance Providers may use the information to contact you directly with quotations by means of telephone, fax, and email, even if you have registered your phone number(s) on local and/or national no-call lists. You further acknowledge and agree that each Insurance Provider that receives your quote request from this website or from our affiliates may confirm your information through the use of a consumer report, which may include among other things, your driving record and/or credit score. For purposes of faxing, it is understood that Insurance Providers have an established business relationship with each user of this website, if required to comply with the then current law.

We use reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that the Insurance Providers are obligated to protect your PII to at least the degree established in this policy. Additionally, it is our policy to require Insurance Providers to use commercially reasonable means to secure the receipt and processing of your PII.

You should be aware that after an Insurance Provider contacts you directly, any information you provide to the Insurance Provider, which may be the same as or similar to the PII you submitted to us through this website, will no longer be covered by this policy. In such cases, you should verify the individual Insurance Provider's privacy policies and practices. We have no control over these Insurance Providers and their practices and cannot and will not be responsible or liable, financial or otherwise, for their respective privacy policies and practices. Also be aware that the Insurance Providers may use the PII they acquire from this website in connection with other information they acquire about you (from other sources that have collected PII about you such as credit reporting companies, etc.) as well as information you provide them directly. We cannot and will not be responsible or liable, financial or otherwise, for any of the PII that you provide directly to Insurance Providers after the Insurance Provider contacts you or that they acquire from sources other than this website.

We may also share your PII with the following types of entities and/or under the following circumstances:

Third parties with whom we have promotional or advertising relationships (provided that we are not otherwise restricted from this sharing of information). If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, contact us at compliance@my-insurance-savings.com.

### If we obtained your information from public sources.

There is no way for you to access or update your information once a request is submitted. If you make a mistake in a request, you can re-submit your information in full. We do not directly contact you through email or telephone. If you no longer want to receive correspondence regarding insurance quotes, you need to take action directly by contacting the respective Insurance Provider(s) that contact you and ask them to no longer contact you. We will not sell, rent or disclose your PII to third parties for purposes of their own marketing campaigns except as authorized in this policy.

We may provide your PII to, or permit access to it by, our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, vendors and/or service providers, such as our ISP or infrastructure hosting companies, for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf, or where such access is incidental to their providing assistance to us. In such cases, we expect these parties to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this privacy policy.

We reserve the right to disclose your PII as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a court order, legal process or judicial proceeding served on us.

### Access

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may [correct, update, amend, delete/remove or deactivate it] by emailing our Customer Support at compliance@my-insurance-savings.com or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.

### Data Rentention

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at compliance@my-insurance-savings.com. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

### Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
