# Proxibid: Privacy Policy

Effective: July 1, 2002

General Statement

Your privacy is one of our highest priorities at Proxibid. We provide this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed choice about your personal information. We desire to be open and honest at all times with you about information collected from you, how that information is used, and your rights regarding that information.

To make this Privacy Policy easy for you to find, we provide it on our welcome page and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. If you have any questions or comments about this privacy statement, please contact Proxibid’s privacy representative:

This privacy statement applies to all information collected by or supplied to [http://www.proxibid.com](http://www.proxibid.com/).

OVERVIEW

Proxibid’s purpose is to provide bidders an opportunity to participate in live auctions even when they cannot be physically present at the auction site. Proxibid webcasts the live auction and allows bidders to place bids in real time. Proxibid can also place automated bids on behalf of a bidder unable to personally monitor the auction webcast.  
Proxibid collects information from you to create your Bidder Profile. This Bidder Profile allows Proxibid to verify your identity and contact you regarding your auction activity.

All auctions are operated by independent Auction Houses. Proxibid only facilitates your access to these Auction Houses when you are unable to attend in person. The Auction Houses have their own rules and requirements for participating in each auction. You may be required to submit information to the Auction House before participating in an auction. This information is governed by the Auction House’s privacy policy, not Proxibid’s privacy policy. Before you submit any information to an Auction House, you should review that Auction House’s privacy policy to understand how your information will be handled.

Proxibid does not have any control over operation of the actual auctions. Proxibid only facilitates the web connection between the Auction site and you, the Bidder.

INFORMATION COLLECTED BY PROXIBID

Proxibid collects contact information to sign you up as a Bidder. That information is provided to the individual Auction Houses when you select to apply for participation in one of their auctions. Proxibid needs the following information for every Bidder using proxibid.com:

Name:  
Address:  
E-mail:  
Home Phone Number  
Work Phone Number  
Affirmation that you are over the age of 21  
Credit Card Billing Address

Proxibid does not collect any information about individual Bidders other than the information provided directly to us in connection with Bidder Profiles.

We do gather aggregate information about site usage, such as the number of visitors, most visited pages, and length of visit. However, this information does not identify Bidders specifically by IP address, e-mail address or other user identifier. Rather, it tells us how our Bidders as a group are using the site. Thus, aggregate site usage data helps us expand and improve the Proxibid web site in order to make your experience with Proxibid the best possible.

You may be required to submit additional information to participate in certain auctions. Each individual Auction House determines what information you will be required to submit to participate. This information is submitted through our website and stored in our database. The information is passed on to the Auction House requiring it. Any information received by the Auction House is governed by the Auction House’s privacy policy, not Proxibid’s privacy policy. We provide a direct link to each Auction House’s Privacy Policy from the Proxibid website. We suggest that you review the individual Auction House’s Privacy Policy before you submit any personally identifiable information.

We do not sell, trade or rent any of your information. Other than the contact information we provide to the Auction Houses, we do not provide any of your information to a third party, unless you expressly give permission to do so. Thus, your personal information is only used to help you participate in live auctions.

Please rest assured that Proxibid has taken adequate precautions to protect both the physical and electronic security of collected information and other data.

COOKIES

Proxibid, Inc. only collects information pertaining to session cookies and does not store any persistent cookies on your computer hard drive. A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your browser-- along with a Web page-- when you access a Web site.

There are two kinds of cookies. A session cookie is a line of text that is stored temporarily in your computer's RAM. Because a session cookie is never written to a drive, it is destroyed as soon as you close your browser. A persistent cookie is a more permanent line of text that gets saved by your browser to a file on your hard drive. Depending on your browser settings, you may receive notification that a given site is requesting cookie information, possibly with an expiration date. Persistent cookies have an expiration date in the future. Session cookies have no date associated with them. Proxibid.com uses ABSOLUTELY NO persistent cookies. The site DOES however require the 'session cookie'. Accessing any and all of Proxibid's web pages will create a session cookie. And it is indeed required for any and all of the pages to work. But as stated above, it is only stored in memory for as long as you have your browser window open.

SECURITY

Proxibid takes industry standard security measures to protect your information. Proxibid has contracted with First Technology Solutions to provide security for Proxibid’s physical servers.

We restrict access to your personal identification and contact information within the company to only those authorized employees who need to use that information for a specific job function.

Though Proxibid takes the multiple electronic and physical security precautions described herein, we cannot be responsible if a third-party gains access to the database or your personal or credit card information by evading our security measures.

CHANGING YOUR BIDDER PROFILE

You may change, update or delete any of the information you have provided to Proxibid by calling Proxibid at (402) 505-7770 or emailing Proxibid at [info@proxibid.com](mailto:info@proxibid.com). We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. You can access your Bidder Profile through the login option on the Proxibid homepage. If you find an error in your Bidder Profile, please send an e-mail to [techsupport@proxibid.com](mailto:techsupport@proxibid.com) notifying us of the error. Please include credible evidence of the error and the correct information for your Bidder Profile.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Proxibid contains links to web sites of other companies. This policy does not apply to the privacy practices of those sites. We strongly suggest that you visit the privacy section of those web sites to learn about the collection and use of your personal information before you provide any information to those sites. Proxibid is not responsible for the use of personal information collected at other sites.

Except as described in this Privacy Policy, Proxibid does not disclose any of your personal contact information to third parties except when it is required by law, or to protect Proxibid, our Users or others.

POLICY AMENDMENTS

From time to time, we may use Bidder information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If such a change in use would occur, Proxibid will post any changes to the privacy policy, allowing you to know the kind of information collected by Proxibid and how that information is used.

If you are concerned about how your collected information is used, please refer to this page regularly. You may prevent your information from being used for any new purpose by opting-out at [opt-out@proxibid.com](mailto:opt-out@proxibid.com).

Again, if you have questions about this privacy policy, please feel free to contact our Privacy Representative as identified at the top of this page.
