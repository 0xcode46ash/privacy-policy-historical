7\. How we use your personal information

  * Administer your donation, including processing gift aid
  * Keep a record of your relationship with us
  * Manage your marketing and communication preferences
  * Undertake equal opportunities monitoring
  * Monitor the diversity of our supporters



We may also use your Information for data analysis and performance monitoring which helps us to analyse the performance of various actions, appeals and incentives to inform future activity across the organisation, helping Amnesty International UK to be more effective in combating human rights abuses.

We include a piece of code on our website called the Facebook Pixel which allows us to advertise to you on Facebook. The advert is shown on your own Facebook page. You can set preferences for how Facebook advertises to you using Facebook ad preferences ([https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads&section=prefs&view](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads&section=prefs&view)).

7.3 We may permit selected third parties to use your Information, to contact you about products, services or issues which may be of interest to you, only if you have given us permission to do so. If you do not wish to receive any such communications from us or third parties, you may opt out by notifying our Supporter Communications Team via [sct@amnesty.org.uk](mailto:sct@amnesty.org.uk) or on 020 7033 1777.

7.4 We may offer you the opportunity to sign up to a mailing list and/or newsletter, to participate in a survey or a competition, or to receive information by email about third parties' products and services, or any other products and services which we provide.  If you sign up for any of these and subsequently change your mind, you may opt out by notifying our Supporter Communications Team via [sct@amnesty.org.uk](mailto:sct@amnesty.org.uk) or on 020 7033 1777, or by clicking on the 'unsubscribe' link at the end of every e-communication you receive from us.

8\. Disclosure of your Information to third parties

8.1 Except as set out below, we will not sell, share, distribute or disclose your Information without your consent, unless we believe in good faith that the law requires it.  

8.2 Where we need to use third party organisations to process personal data on our behalf, for example a mailing house, we will put in place a contract with the company to ensure that the data is properly protected and treated in accordance with the Act.

8.3 If you have subscribed to any of our e-communications, e-zines or e-newsletters, we will not sell or rent this information to anyone.

8.4 As stated in Section 7, we may share your Information with selected third parties and other like-minded organisations, in order to provide you with information about products, services or issues which may be of interest to you, if you have indicated that you wish to receive such communications.

8.5 From time to time we may work in partnership with other organisations on a campaign and so you may receive joint communications from Amnesty International UK and the partnership organisation(s) in question, unless you have indicated that you do not wish to receive such communications.  

8.6 We may share your Information with Facebook, to help us ensure our posts reach individuals that are likely to be interested in them — saving us money and helping us to achieve the greatest impact. Facebook will not use your personal information for any other purpose.

9\. Transfer to third parties

9.1 The Information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the EEA for our own administration purposes or for the purpose of any international campaign run by Amnesty International UK and an organisation located outside of the EEA.  Such organisations may be engaged in, among other things, the processing of your personal details as a subscriber to the campaign in question and the processing of your payment details, if you make a donation to the campaign. These partners are not allowed to contact you for marketing purposes.

9.2 By submitting your Information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.  We cannot guarantee that any organisation located outside of the EEA will have adequate safeguards for the protection of personal data, but we will take all steps reasonably necessary and in line with the Act to ensure that your Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

9.3 If Amnesty International UK or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, personal data held by it about its members may be one of the transferred assets.

10\. Your payment details

Our Payment Service Provider is Sage Pay. Sage Pay provides a secure payment gateway (Level 1 PCI DSS). It is Sage Pay’s utmost priority to ensure that transaction data is handled in a safe and secure way. Sage Pay uses a range secure methods such as fraud screening, I.P address blocking and 3D secure. Once on the Sage Pay systems, all sensitive data is secured using the same internationally recognised 256-bit encryption standards. Sage Pay is PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) compliant to the highest level and maintains regular security audits. They are also regularly audited by the banks and banking authorities to ensure that their systems are impenetrable. Sage Pay is an active member of the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) that defines card industry global regulation. In addition, you know that your session is in a secure encrypted environment when you see https:// in the web address, and/or when you see the locked padlock symbol alongside the URL.

11\. 'Invite a friend'

We may from time to time operate an 'Invite a friend' or similar service.  This is a referral service, designed to make it easy for you to recommend the Sites and related websites or offers to a friend, and is a two-step process.  First, you send us your friend's name and email address, and secondly, we contact the friend, telling them who we are, and inviting them to join a campaign or to visit one or more of the Site.  When we contact your friend, we always advise them of the name and email address of the friend who made the original referral.  We will not use your friend's details for any other purpose but due to the functionality of our website all emails will be stored within our database.

12\. Links to third parties' sites

We may provide links to other websites.  Before supplying any personal information to any other website, we recommend that you check that website's Privacy Policy. We do not accept responsibility for the protection of any data supplied to other sites linked to from our own.

13\. Security

13.1 When you submit your Information to us on any of the Sites, we take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely. Unfortunately, it is not possible to guarantee the total security of any data transmitted over the Internet. While we strive to protect your Information as much as we can, Amnesty International UK cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you therefore do this at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we take reasonable steps to ensure its security on our systems, but we take no responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.

13.2 Please remember that other methods of Internet communication, such as emails and messages sent via a website, are not secure unless they are encrypted.  

14\. Changes to this policy

Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time.  This policy will be updated if there are any changes in our practice.  

The amended version will be published on the Site.

This will replace any previous privacy policy wording and all conditions and terms of use will be in force from the date of publication.

3.3 How do we use cookies?

On our websites, cookies record information about your online preferences, remember information about you when you visit our site and compile statistical reports on website activity. Some cookies are used that are essential in order to provide our services to you.

During the course of any visit to amnesty.org.uk, your navigation through the site is recorded by a cookie that is downloaded to your device. The information recorded is retrieved on a repeat visit to the site by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.

Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of our visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. Below we have set out the four categories of cookies that Amnesty International UK uses on our website.

These cookies are:

Strictly necessary cookies - These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features. Without these cookies, services you have asked for, such as making payments for donations cannot be provided. These cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you have been on the internet.

Performance cookies - These cookies collect information about how our visitors use the website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from any web pages. They also allow us to record and count the number of visitors to the website, all of which enables us to see how visitors use the website in order to improve the way that our website works. These cookies do not collect information that identifies a visitor, as all information these cookies collect is anonymous and is only used to improve how our website works.

Functionality cookies - These cookies allow our website to remember choices you make (such as your login details or your choices in relation to our newsletters and subscriptions). Whenever these cookies are used we will notify you before using the cookie, providing more information about the functionality cookie to be used, and how it might improve your user experience. The information these cookies collect is usually anonymised. They do not gather any information about you that could be used for advertising or remember where you have been on the internet. AIUK doesn't currently collect this type of cookies. If we decide to do so in the future we will update this policy.

Targeting cookies - These cookies collect several pieces of information about your browsing habits. They are placed by our third party service provider [although we may also place a cookie that collects this kind of information]. All of the information that these cookies collect is anonymised, although they contain a unique key that is able to distinguish, for example, individual user browsing habits, or log if an individual user has clicked on a one of our suggested recommendations. These cookies can track your visits around the website, but they do not usually know who you are. They remember that you have visited our website and your browsing habits on our website to improve your experience, so that our recommendations are a better fit for you. This information is only shared between us and our third party service provider. Without these cookies, the user experience on our website will be less relevant to you and your interests.
