# Privacy Policy | Pro Guitar Tuner

If you require any more information or have any questions about our privacy policy, please feel free to [contact us](http://www.proguitartuner.com/contact-us/).

At proguitartuner.com, the privacy of our visitors is of importance to us. This privacy policy document outlines the types of personal information is received and collected by proguitartuner.com and how it is used.

**Flash application**  
The online guitar tuner at proguitartuner.com is made with Adobe Flash. Audio data from the users microphone and/or line-in input is analysed in order to determine the pitch of the sound. No audio data is stored or sent to the server, since it is processed locally on the user’s computer. Neither we or any other third party has access to the audio data. When the tuner is loaded, a pop-up window appears asking for microphone and camera access. This is an integrated security procedure from Adobe and proguitartuner.com ensures that nothing else than the audio signal is processed.
