## Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** Friday, March 18, 2005

### Collection of Personal Information and Use

The operator of this website is Continental Promotion Group, Inc. ("CPG"), acting under an agreement with our various clients. This privacy policy explains our collection, use, disclosure and protection of your personal information. We will be collecting such information as your name, address, e-mail address, and product proof-of-purchase data. This information is used for validation of submissions, for processing and mailing rebate checks, for general fulfillment of the promotional offers, and for related customer service purposes. Without this information we cannot validate, process or fulfill your submission. We do not sell, rent, share or disclose the information collected to third parties without your prior consent, except in the limited circumstances described as follows: We may need to disclose personal information when required by law where we have a good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to comply with a subpoena, judicial proceeding, a court order or other legal process. We may also disclose certain of the information collected to our client, who is the sponsor of the promotion in which you participated.

### Choice

Your participation in any promotion by sending us your rebate submission is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Because we require the information collected through this site for processing your submission and providing customer service, your choice to opt out is limited to not submitting your rebate request or customer service request through this site, but instead completing your rebate submission form and mailing it in for processing, and using the toll-free customer service number provided on such form.

### Protection of Personal Information

We have put into place security measures to help protect personal information from loss, misuse or alteration while it is under our control. We have implemented certain systematic, physical, and managerial procedures in an effort to protect against unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain your data, and otherwise secure the information collected. The information we collect is located on a secured server behind our firewall and is not directly connected to the Internet. In addition, we use Secure Socket Software and password protection procedures to safeguard the information collected.

### Updating, Reviewing or Correcting Personal Information

If you need to change or correct your personal information (such as your address), or if you wish to remove or deactivate your personal information, or if you have any questions or complaints about your submission, or this Privacy Policy, please contact our Rebate Service Center with your request, question, or concern at 1-877-360-6632.

### Changes to this Statement

We reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time, but will alert you that changes have been made by indicating at the top of the privacy statement the date it was last updated. We encourage you to review our privacy statement to make sure you understand how information you provide will be used. If there is ever a material change to how we use information you provide and the new uses are unrelated to uses we disclose in this statement, we will communicate those changes in advance.
