# Diverse Solutions - Privacy Policy

## Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us. At Diverse Solutions we have a few fundamental principles:

  * We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can't stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
  * We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  * We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
  * In our blogging products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what's visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.



Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:

DiverseSolutions.org (" **Diverse Solutions** ") operates [diversesolutions.org](http://www.diversesolutions.org/). It is Diverse Solution's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Diverse Solutions collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Diverse Solution's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Diverse Solution's visitors use its website. From time to time, Diverse Solutions may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Diverse Solution also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Diverse Solution does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Diverse Solution's websites choose to interact with Diverse Solutions in ways that require Diverse Solutions to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Diverse Solutions gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for our forum at [diversesolutions.org/forum](https://web.archive.org/web/20100609051552id_/http%3A//www.diversesolutions.org/forum/index.php) to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Diverse Solutions are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Diverse Solutions collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Diverse Solutions. Diverse Solutions does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

Diverse Solutions may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Diverse Solutions may monitor the most popular blogs on the [DiverseSolutions.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20100609051552id_/http%3A//www.diversesolutions.org/forum/index.php) site. Diverse Solutions may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Diverse Solutions does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Diverse Solutions discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Diverse Solution's behalf or to provide services available at Diverse Solution's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Diverse Solution's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Diverse Solutions will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Diverse Solutions discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Diverse Solutions believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Diverse Solutions, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Diverse Solutions website and have supplied your email address, Diverse Solutions may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Diverse Solutions and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Diverse Solutions takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Diverse Solutions uses cookies to help Diverse Solutions identify and track visitors, their usage of Diverse Solutions website, and their website access preferences. Diverse Solutions visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Diverse Solution's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Diverse Solution's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Ads

Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Diverse Solutions and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Diverse Solutions may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Diverse Solution's sole discretion. Diverse Solutions encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
