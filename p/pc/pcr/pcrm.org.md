# PCRM | Privacy Policy

__

### Your Privacy

The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) protects the integrity and privacy of personal information gathered from our members and from visitors to our websites. Because protecting your privacy is of great importance to us, we have created this privacy policy to communicate our practices regarding the collection and dissemination of personal information that can be linked to a specific individual, such as a name, address, phone number, e-mail address, or any other information provided to us by our members and by visitors to our websites.

These policies do not extend to external sites linked to PCRM Marketplace or non-PCRM websites to which there might be a link from a PCRM Web page. Please check with these companies or organizations and sites for their policies regarding data privacy, including the use of "cookies."

### Why does PCRM ask for my information?

In order to participate in some activities, you might be asked to provide some personal information. This could be in connection with any one or combination of the following:

  * Registering for PCRM’s online community, our 21-Day Vegan Kickstart program, or to receive ongoing communications such as Recipe of the Week or Breaking Medical News
  * Participating in PCRM’s action alerts, petitions, and giveaways
  * Making contributions or membership gifts
  * Ordering literature or merchandise



### What information does PCRM collect?

We do not collect personal information from our visitors unless they register, take some type of action, or donate.  We do capture name, address, and other demographic information that is voluntarily provided, and may obtain other information that will help us tailor communications to your interests.

### How does PCRM use information that is gathered?

We use your information to send you details about our campaigns, events, and activities, volunteer opportunities, action alerts, and opportunities to support our lifesaving work. PCRM also aggregates and uses information gathered to measure interest in and use of various areas on our websites and to improve our ability to serve you and other visitors.

### Does PCRM use "cookies" on its websites?

PCRM uses "cookies" on some Web pages. A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on a visitor's hard drive but does not contain any personal information itself. Cookies enhance a visitor's experience by preventing the visitor from having to log in or provide information each time he or she revisits a Web page and by customizing content based on a visitor's interests. Visitors can configure their browsers to refuse cookies or to be alerted when a site is attempting to send a cookie, although some PCRM e-commerce pages will not function properly on a browser that does not accept cookies. PCRM also uses cookies to administer its websites, track visitor movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

### Is information shared with other organizations?

The information that we gather from subscribers or anyone else who provides their e-mail addresses is not shared with non-PCRM–affiliated organizations or companies. From time to time, we may send out e-mail messages that might include information about or on behalf of these like-minded organizations and companies, but we do not provide them with access to any personal information that you have provided, including your e-mail address. However, should you follow links to any Web pages of such organizations and provide any information about yourself, that will be subject to the privacy policy of that organization. 

### Can I unsubscribe from communications from PCRM?

All e-mail messages sent to e-mail newsletter subscribers contain a link that allows you to unsubscribe or to modify your profile. You may subscribe or unsubscribe to e-mail communication from PCRM at any time.

If you have any questions about PCRM e-mail communications, please e-mail [info@pcrm.org](mailto:info@pcrm.org).

### How does PCRM protect my information?

PCRM is extremely protective of the information gathered through its membership and websites. Our websites have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information under our control. Our Web server is located in a locked, secure environment.

When you contribute to PCRM online or make a purchase through the PCRM Marketplace, we use a secure server and encryption to protect your financial and other personal information during transmission. 

### Does PCRM rent, sell, or trade my information?

PCRM occasionally makes the names and postal addresses of donors available to reputable advocacy and nonprofit organizations and commercial companies. That information is sent to mail processors, and those organizations do not actually receive that information unless you respond.

If you are a PCRM donor and you don't want to your information exchanged with other organizations and companies, please e-mail us at [membership@PCRM.org](mailto:membership@PCRM.org) or call us at 202-527-7304 to speak to our membership staff. 

The easiest way to correct or change other information regarding your membership is to contact our membership staff at [membership@PCRM.org](mailto:membership@PCRM.org) or 202-527-7304.

If you are not a PCRM member or donor, your information will not be exchanged with organizations that are not affiliated with PCRM.

### Additional questions?

If you have any questions about our privacy policy, the information that we have collected from you online, the practices of this site, or your interaction with this website, please e-mail [membership@PCRM.org](mailto:membership@PCRM.org).
