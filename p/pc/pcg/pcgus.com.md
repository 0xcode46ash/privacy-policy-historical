# Privacy Policy | PCG : Public Consulting Group

Public Consulting Group and its affiliates (collectively referred to as “PCG”) respect the privacy of your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information that PCG may collect from you at its web sites (each referred to as “the Site”), what we do with that information, and with whom we may share the information. 

By using the Site, the User is accepting the Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy cannot be changed by the User. If the User does not agree to the Privacy Policy, then the User may not use the Site. 

The Privacy Policy applies to all PCG web sites that are generally accessible by the public. The Privacy Policy does not apply to password-protected web sites created by PCG for specific PCG clients, which by their nature may require different uses of personal information. The policy also does not apply to the web sites to which you may navigate from this web site. 

PCG may amend this Privacy Policy at any time without notice. It is the responsibility of the User to periodically review this Privacy Policy for changes. When amendments are made, the “revised” date below will be amended accordingly. Your continued use of the Site after an amendment constitutes your acceptance of the amendment.

PCG collects two types of User information: computer information that is collected automatically and personal information that you may choose to enter voluntarily.

When you visit this Site, PCG does not automatically collect personal information from you or about you (such as your name or mailing address). However, the Site does place small files called “cookies” on your computer to automatically collect and store certain types of data from the computer that you use to access the Site. This information includes but is not limited to the following: browser and platform type (e.g., Internet Explorer browser on a PC platform); the Internet Service Provider, or “ISP” (e.g., AT&T); the Internet Protocol (IP) address unique to the computer; the number and length of visits; the pages visited; and the referral source (e.g., Google) and search terms that led to the Site page. PCG may use this computer information to assess interest in the Site and its pages and/or for other internal business purposes.

PCG may request and collect certain personal information from Users who wish to be contacted by PCG or to receive PCG publications such as white papers and newsletters. This personal information includes the User’s name, email address, telephone number, and mailing address. This site does not request or collect other personal information such as social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, or financial account numbers. You are under no obligation to provide any information about yourself, though certain information may be required if you request materials or a response from PCG. We will not attempt to match this personal information with IP  addresses and other automatically collected information, except as may be necessary to police misuse of the Site. You may opt out of receiving communications from PCG at any time by contacting the Site Administrator (see below).

User information collected through the Site is stored securely within the PCG network. PCG does not sell or transfer your information to unaffiliated third parties, except for the purposes of the operation of the Site, to comply with applicable laws (including subpoena requests), and to respond to your request(s). PCG has security agreements in place with any affiliates who may receive information from this site to ensure your information remains secure. User information also may be disclosed in connection with a merger or the sale of PCG assets. Aggregated or otherwise anonymous data may be used and shared for any purpose, though this data will be de-identified in such a way that no individuals can be identified. 

Upon its determination that records containing User information are no longer are of use to PCG, PCG will dispose of such records by secure means so that any personal information is no longer readable. 

A User may review and update the personal information that PCG has collected regarding him or her by contacting the Site Administrator (see below). 

Maintaining the security of your personal information is of utmost concern to PCG. PCG uses reasonable security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access. However, no system can be absolutely secure. Consequently, you should not transmit to the Site any health information or other information that you consider sensitive. PCG cannot warrant the security of your personal information transmitted to the Site, and you do so at your own risk.

The Site is administered by PCG’s webmaster. The webmaster can be contacted by email at
