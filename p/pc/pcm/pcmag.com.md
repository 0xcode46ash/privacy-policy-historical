TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit initiative whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the principles of disclosure and informed consent. Because this site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed and audited for compliance by TRUSTe.

ZDNet collects personal information about our users only during registration for the ZDNet service, from our use of "cookie" technology as you use the service and during entry into a ZDNet contest or sweepstakes. 

ZDNet respects your right to privacy. As part of the registration process, we give you the opportunity to decline to receive any mailings from either ZDNet or other parties to whom ZDNet may provide such information. 

The data we collect from cookies and other places is used in the aggregate to give us demographic information about the entire ZDNet audience in order to improve the ZDNet service.

However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties which receive the information. ZDNet also links to a wide variety of other sites.
