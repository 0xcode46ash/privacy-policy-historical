# PC Magazine

We are committed to protecting your privacy at Ziff Davis Media. We will not collect any personal information from you that you do not volunteer, and we are the sole owner of all information collected on this site. We do not sell, share, or rent this information to others in any way that we have not mentioned in this statement. 

How we use cookies

As you probably know, cookies are small pieces of information that some Web sites store on your computer's hard drive when you visit them. Like many other Web sites, Ziff Davis Media uses cookies to identify members so they don't have to re-enter a user id and password when they, for example, wish to post to a discussion. By allowing us to better understand how users access the site, cookies also help us improve your experience and deliver more relevant content to you. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies but allow you to modify security settings so you can approve or reject cookies on a case-by-case basis. If you choose to become a member of this Web site, you must have cookies enabled to access any member related pages (i.e. Discussion Boards, Member Profile pages, Search for a Member). 

What we provide to third parties

While Ziff Davis Media does not provide any third-party access to your personal information, we may provide third parties with aggregate statistics about our customers, traffic patterns, and related site information. This data reflects site usage patterns gathered during thousands of customer visits to our Web site each month but does not contain behavioral or identifying information about any individual member, unless that member has given us permission to share that information. We may also provide log files and other databases of user information to third parties for analysis, so we can get a better understanding of traffic through our site and thus improve our content offerings. Ziff Davis Media also may use third party companies to provide delivery of e-mail newsletters and other messages over e-mail. Ziff Davis Media uses a third-party advertising company to serve ads when you visit our sites. This company may use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to our and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. In addition, we share web site usage information about visitors to our sites with this company for the purpose of managing and targeting advertisements on our sites. For this purpose, we and our third-party advertising company may use pixel tags (also called clear gifs and beacons). If you would like more information about the information collection practices of this third-party advertising company and to know your choices about not having this information used by this company, [click here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/privacy/default.asp?asp_object_1=&). 

The Magazines

For magazine subscribers, we collect the information we need when you place a subscription order, and sometimes during the course of a subscription when additional information is required to renew it or to provide customer service. We sometimes make lists of our customers available to carefully screened providers of quality goods and services. If you don't wish to receive such mailings, please visit [www.zmcirc.com/service/](http://www.zmcirc.com/service/). Your information may not be immediately available - please allow 2-4 weeks for us to process new orders. The data we collect from our subscribers is used collectively to give us demographic information about our entire audience, which helps us improve the magazine. We also share this information with our advertisers to help them better understand our services. 

Security

We use reasonable precautions to keep the personal information you disclose to both our magazine and website secure and to only release this information to third parties we believe share our commitment to privacy. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for the actions of these parties. 

Obtaining your consent

By using our Web site, you give Ziff Davis Media permission to collect information about the pages served to you as an anonymous user for the purpose of calculating aggregate site statistics. If you register at Ziff Davis Media, you authorize Ziff Davis Media to use information you provide to personalize the information we deliver to you and to use your demographic information when calculating aggregate customer data.
