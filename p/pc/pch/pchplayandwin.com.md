**Collection of Information**   
When you register to play on PCHGames.com, we collect personal information including name, address, birthday and email address. We may use this information to contact you for lost username or password purposes, to present you with advertising when you visit PCHGames that you may find of interest and to send you the PCHGames.com newsletter. The newsletter is emailed to you only if you indicated that you would like to receive it when you register for PCHGames.com. Each time the newsletter is emailed to you, you will have the opportunity to unsubscribe. 

PCHGames.com users have the ability to voluntarily create and modify their user profile using the "Profiles" menu. The information collected, such as name, age, gender and location is displayed to other users and is completely voluntary. PCHGames.com does not require users to create a user profile. 

PCHGames.com users have the ability to voluntarily create and modify their user profile using the "Profiles" menu. The information collected, such as name, age, gender and location is displayed to other users and is completely voluntary. PCHGames.com does not require users to create a user profile. 

PCHGames.com collects information needed to fulfill prizes and to track and verify compliance with PCHGames.com policies and federal, state, and local laws. 

Unless otherwise indicated by the provisions of this Privacy Policy, information specific to a user's personal identity will not be revealed to third parties unless the user “opts-in” to receive other specific information such as partner and advertiser offers. 

We may utilize the services of third party service providers and subcontractors to collect or maintain such information for administrative purposes and to improve the user experience when you visit PCHGames.com. 

The information you supply to us when you register and set up your personal PCHGames.com account is additionally used to provide our basic services and for the purpose of awarding prizes. Because we store your personal information, we don't have to ask you to re-register each time you visit our site. 

PCHGames.com uses “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that most major Web sites write to your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow PCHGames.com to measure activity on the Site and to improve your user experience. 

You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers, which is standard in the Internet industry. PCHgames.com does not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to PCHGames.com’s privacy policies. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you’d prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the Site will not function properly if you do so. 

PCHGames.com may also disclose personal information to law enforcement or appropriate civil authorities when we believe disclosure is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, legal proceeding or investigation. We may also disclose such information when it is necessary to address potential or actually injury or interference with our rights, property, users or others who may be harmed or suffer loss or damage. 

PCHGames.com is required by law to provide personal information regarding prizes or rewards of $600 or more to the IRS. This information may include information such as a player's social security number, name and address. Except as provided in this section, PCHGames.com does not share social security numbers with any organization other than the IRS for tax-reporting purposes. 

**Collection and use of players' IP addresses**   
An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Web. Web servers - the big computers that "serve up" Web pages - automatically identify your computer by its IP address. 

PCHGames.com collects IP addresses to analyze trends, administer our site, anonymously track players' movements on our site, and to gather broad demographic information for statistical purposes. When guests request pages from the Site, our servers log those guests' IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to any personal information, so that while a player's session will be logged, the player remains anonymous - to us, and to anyone else. 

We use IP addresses in only a few types of situations. We may use these addresses to identify a player when it's necessary to enforce compliance with our policies or terms of service, or to protect our service, Site, customers or others. We may also use these addresses to capture time stamps so that we can determine peak and off-peak load times. These addresses may also be used to determine browser type for demographic information. PCHGames.com also may be required to disclose IP address information when required in legal proceedings or by law enforcement agencies. 

**Children and Privacy**   


PCHGames.com does not knowingly collect data from anyone under the age of 13. 

**Your acceptance of this privacy policy**  


By using the Site, you indicate your agreement with the terms and conditions of this privacy policy. If you do not agree with this privacy policy, then do not use the Site. We reserve the right to change the terms of this privacy policy. We will notify you of any material changes to this policy via email or by posting a prominent notice on the Site stating that the privacy policy has been updated. We will give you an opportunity to "opt out" of having your information collected and used pursuant to this materially different privacy policy. Also, we encourage you to review this privacy policy on a regular basis. Last update: August, 2009.
