**Privacy Policy** This site is a member of the [**_IDG_** **Network of Sites**](https://web.archive.org/Idg/Sales.nsf/45a9cc76c864eca5cc2567bf0025f9ca/b276ba9beddb172fcc256aa300712ab0!OpenDocument). _IDG_ complies strictly with New Zealand’s [**Privacy Act**](http://www.knowledge-basket.co.nz/privacy/people/peotop.html) and its 12 information privacy principles which deal with the collection, holding, use and disclosure of personal information. And _IDG_ does not monitor individual traffic patterns — only aggregate visitor behaviour is collected.Most of the _IDG_ network can be accessed without disclosing personal information. Where personal information is provided to us, _IDG_ maintains and uses that information in strict conformity with the Privacy Act. This includes your right under the Act to access information about yourself and to ask for it to be corrected, and to limit the purposes for which it can be used. _IDG_ will not release your personal data without your consent.

_IDG_

occasionally uses email and subscriber lists on behalf of companies who wish to mail our subscribers. We believe direct communication can be an efficient way to present our subscribers with information relevant to them. All communication is controlled by us and companies do not have access to our subscribers’ names and addresses. Any information our subscribers give us remains confidential. Where information collected on this site may be used in this way, you will be advised at the point where this information is collected and given the opportunity to decline such use.

**Cookies**

Cookies are small files that contain information a Web site uses for tracking purposes. _IDG_ does not typically use “cookies” but it may use them from time to time to facilitate the user experience or to enhance site content by compiling aggregate information about what specific sections and pages users visit. They may also be used by partner and advertiser sites associated with _IDG_ sites. Advertisers or independent third parties who operate the servers on which the ads reside may also place cookies. Although _IDG_ encourages third parties to adhere to appropriate privacy standards and policies, _IDG_ is not responsible for the actions or policies of such parties.Cookie information and privacy statements can be obtained directly from our third party ad server, [**DoubleClick**](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/default.asp?asp_object_l=&).

**Email Newsletters**

You will only receive email newsletters from us if you have a) expressly signed up for a newsletter on an IDGNet or UnlimitedNet website or b) you are a subscriber to one of our publications and have been invited to sign up to an IDGNet or Unlimited email newsletter.The information we gather from subscribers to our email newsletters (including email addresses) is not shared with our email advertisers or other parties. From time to time we may send out emails on behalf of these advertisers, but we do not provide them with access to any personal information that you have provided.In order to provide you with better and more relevant advertising and services, we compile information about email response and website usage. This information helps us to better understand our customers' site usage patterns and also what types of content and advertising may help to encourage those visits. This information also helps us to understand the types of marketing messages our customers are interested in receiving.All emails sent contain a link to unsubscribe or to modify your profile. You may subscribe or unsubscribe to any newsletter at any time.

**HTML Newsletters**

We make use of both "open-tracking" and "click-tracking" in our HTML newsletters (i.e. emails that contain text and images). Open-tracking allows us to find out how many people have viewed our email newsletters and click-tracking allows us to find out which links in the newsletter were clicked on. This helps us to refine and improve the editorial content of our newsletters, and to provide you with relevant information."HTML-sensing" is used to determine if your email client supports HTML-based emails. This is employed only if you request our system to detect whether you can receive HTML emails.If you have any questions, please email: [**info@idg.tx.co.nz**](mailto:info@idg.tx.co.nz)

**Online Transactions**

Online transactions including credit card transactions on _IDG_ are secured using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). This is a standard for online transactions on the Web which provides security using digital certificates issued by Certification Authorities (companies who verify the authority of organisations before issuing them with a digital certificate). Most browsers also ship with a number of built-in certificates from major certification authorities such as Verisign or Thawte Consulting.The certificate our server is using is issued by [**Thawte Consulting**](http://www.thawte.com/) , who have "trusted root certificates" included in Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer and other common browsers. This "trusted root certificate" allows your browser to be certain that our server is the same server which was issued a Secure Sockets Layer certificate by Thawte Consulting. 

**Traffic Counting Clear Gifs**

Our web sites also use clear gifs, or pixel tags, provided by [**DoubleClick**](http://www.doubleclick.net/) to help double-check our traffic figures. These clear GIFS allow DoubleClick to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits this site. The information we collect and share through this technology is not personally identifiable (It does not include your name, address, telephone number or email address).

**What security procedures are in place to protect my information?**

  
Internally, _IDG_ restricts access to personally identifiable information. Only employees who need access to the information in order to do their jobs have access. These employees are limited in number, and are committed to our privacy and security policies.   
If you have any privacy concerns relating to this site, please address them to IDG’s privacy officer through the _IDG_[ **webmaster**](mailto:nzwebmaster@idg.net.nz) **.**
