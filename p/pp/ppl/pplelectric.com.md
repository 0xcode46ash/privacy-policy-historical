**PPL ELECTRIC UTILITIES**

**WEB SITE PRIVACY POLICY**

**(Revised March 2009)**

PPL Electric Utilities Corporation and its affiliates (“us” or “we”) are concerned about protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes our practices and policies with respect to the collection and use of personal information submitted by you through our web sites (“Web Site” or “Web Sites”), the sharing of that information with third parties and the measures we take to secure such personal information. By using www.pplelectric.com or any of our affiliated websites, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. Please review the contents of this Privacy Policy frequently as we reserve the right to modify or amend this Privacy Policy at any time.

**Personal Information We May Collect**

You can view most of our Web Sites without providing any personal information at all. If, however, you register to access your account online, open or close an account, sign up for specialty billing services, report an electric outage, enable online payment, access our Energy Analyzer, or to access any other services or applications available through our Web Site, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information about yourself, including your name, address, telephone number, email address, social security number, residential and/or business account number, bank account information or payment and account history. We will only collect personally identifiable information to the extent necessary to serve our business purposes or as required or permitted by law.

By providing personally identifiable information, you expressly consent to the privacy practices described in this policy. We do not collect any of this information unless you provide it to us voluntarily. If you do not wish to provide your personal information you do not need to do so.

**Our Use of Personal Information**

We use the personally identifiable information you provide to identify and assess the interests and needs of our customers, to provide information to customers about specific products, services, news and events, to allow customer access to online services such as surveys and account management programs, and to gather broad demographic information about customer trends. We may also use your personal information to send you information about products and services that we think might interest you. 

**Sharing of Personal Information**

In general, we do not disclose our customers’ personally identifiable information to third parties without their consent. We may, however, share personally identifiable information that you provide to us as permitted or required by applicable law and for our business purposes, including without limitation the following:

· Sharing such information with our affiliates and subsidiaries, unless such sharing is prohibited by law; 

· Disclosing such information that is required by regulatory bodies or compelled by law;

· Transferring such information in connection with a merger, consolidation, acquisition, divestiture or other corporate restructuring (including bankruptcy); 

· Making such information available to third parties who are providing a product, service or information that you have requested from us; 

· Making such information available to third parties who are providing services to us or our affiliates; 

· Disclosing such information if necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding any illegal activities or regarding interference with the operation of our site or violation of its terms of use; and

· Disclosing such information is allowed by law.

**Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information**

We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about you which is made available by your browser, computer hardware and/or software, including but not limited to your IP address, browser type, operating system, domain name, access times and referring and exit web sites. For example, we may use “cookies” and “Clear GIFs” to track your activity on our Web Sites and to improve the efficiency of our Web Sites. Cookies are small pieces of information that a web server may place on your computer when you visit a Web Site. Clear GIFs are small pieces of data that may be embedded in images on our Web Sites. Clear GIFs enable us to track your usage of our site.

We use cookies and clear GIFs for a number of purposes, such as to maintain continuity during a user session, to gather data about the usage of our Web Site for research and other purposes, to store your preferences for certain kinds of information and marketing offers, or to store a user name or encrypted identification number so that you do not have to provide this information every time you return to our Web Site. 

Our cookies will track only your online activity relating to our Web Site, and will not track your other Internet activity. Our cookies do not gather personally identifiable information about you. You can decide if and how your computer will accept cookies and clear GIFs by configuring your preferences or options in your browser. If you choose to reject cookies, you may not be able to use certain of our online products and services or Web Site features.

Additionally, we may use “click stream” data to determine the type of computer and browsing software you use, and other site usage information. Any collection or use of click stream data will be anonymous and aggregate, and will not contain any personally identifiable information.

We reserve the right to use and share aggregate and anonymous data (including data aggregated from your and other users of our online products and services such as our Energy Analyzer) for any purpose and with any third parties, unless prohibited by law.

**Information Protection and Security**

The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms on our sites, we encrypt that information during transmission using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the security, integrity and privacy of your information. However, please be advised the electronic communications, including the Internet, are not completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information. 

**Children**

We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If you are under 13 years of age, please talk to your parents about what sites are appropriate.

**Links to Other Web Sites**

Our Web Sites may contain links to third party web sites not owned or operated by us. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any web sites operated by third parties. Once you have left our Web Site, we suggest you check the applicable privacy policy of the third party web site to determine how they will handle any information they collect from you.

**Changes to Privacy Policy**

We reserve the right to amend or modify this Privacy Policy at any time without notice to you. Any amendments or modifications to this Privacy Policy will be posted on our Web Sites with a new revision date and will become effective immediately upon posting. Your continued use of any of our Web Sites following the posting of a revised version of this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the revised privacy policy do not use any of our Web Sites.

**Access and Ability to Correct Personal Information**

If you believe that the personal information we have about you as submitted to us via one of our Web sites is incorrect, please send an e-mail request to the contact information below. We will make reasonable efforts to correct or update it. In order to stop receiving electronic marketing communications from us, you may unsubscribe from our newsletters and other services by following the unsubscribe directions included at the end of each e-mail we send.
