## Data Collection

We collect three different types of data: non-identifiable basic information, non-identifiable cookies, and information (name, email, phone number, company) that you choose to give us through filling out our Contact Us form or by requesting a whitepaper.

## We collect non-identifiable basic information

We collect click-stream data, HTTP protocol elements, and search terms. We use these data for research and development, system tracking, and helping visitors reach the right page. We use these data ourselves, and we share aggregated data with our clients. These data are non-identifiable. This means we can’t (and have no interest in trying to) identify any individual person via these data. We also collect access logs and search strings. We use these data to help improve our site and our clients’ sites.

## We collect non-identifiable cookie information

We collect HTTP cookie data. Again, we use these data for research and development, system tracking, and helping visitors reach the right page. We use these data ourselves and we share aggregated data with our clients. Our cookies are non-identifiable, meaning we can’t (and don’t want to) identify you or any individual person via these data. We collect these cookie data to help improve our web site and our clients’ web sites.

## What are “cookies”?

A cookie is a piece of information sent to a browser by a web server. The browser then returns that information to the Web server. This is how some Web pages “remember” your previous visits; for example, an e-commerce site might use a cookie to remember which items you’ve placed in your online shopping cart. Cookies can also store user preference information, log-in data, etc. Cookies let sites provide you with tailored information.

## Links to other sites

Our sites link to and redirect to third-party websites. We’re not responsible for the privacy practices or the content on those sites.

When you leave our site, it is wise to check the privacy policy of the site you reach. Those sites might place their own cookies, collect data, and use personal information in different ways than we do.  
The privacy policy described on this page only applies to our sites.

## Security

We have security measures in place to protect the information we collect. We use strong encryption to keep these data safe from loss, tampering, misuse, and unauthorized access.

## Policy changes

Should we modify our privacy policy, we’ll update this page accordingly. If we make changes to our policy, we’ll treat previously collected data in accordance with our policy in effect when the data were collected.

## Acceptance of this privacy policy

By using this site, you’re indicating you’ve read and accept our privacy policy. If you don’t agree with this policy, please do not use our site. Continuing to use of this site after we post changes to these terms means you accept those changes. Thanks.
