## Privacy Policy

ppnow.com takes your privacy seriously. We will not sell, lease or exchange your personal data to third parties in ways other than described in this privacy policy. This Privacy Policy is a part of the ppnow.com Terms of Service policy. By using ppnow.comluding services available at the ppnow.com domains, users are using a service provided by ppnow.com. and they agree to be bound by the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy. Some terms may be defined in the Terms of Service. This Privacy Policy only addresses activities from our servers.

1\. Information Collection & Use  
Registration

The ppnow.com service requires a login in order to provide you with a personalized account. During our account registration process, we will collect a login name, password, and an email address from you. You must provide all of this information in order to obtain an account. After completing our registration form, you will receive a welcome email describing your new ppnow.com account, and how to access that account.  
Account Subscriptions

ppnow.com provides a number of tools that will allow you to promote your web site over email. Email addresses entered into these forms are not stored in our database, but may be stored in our system logs in text format to assist us in tracking down abusive users (users flooding the system), or using these tools for spamming. We will never contact addresses logged in this manner.  
Hosted Web Sites

Users hosting web sites with ppnow.com are given tools that may ask you to optionally enter your email address when making comments on their web site, or contacting them through their web site. Since users on ppnow.com can manipulate the HTML code on their site directly, there are opportunities available for a malicious user to inject code that would log your information before it reaches our system. In addition, once in our system, web site owners will have the opportunity to review and modify any information entered into their web site. Since we do not have full control over how members run their individual sites, this privacy policy does not apply to any hosted ppnow.com web site that you do not own. You should check that you trust the owner of a particular web site before submitting personally identifiable information on that site.  
Server Logs

When accessing web pages on the ppnow.com domain, ppnow.com may log your IP address, access URL, time of access, browser type, and referral URL in order to provide us with internal information regarding site traffic statistics. This information may also be used to identify users who are using the service for spam or other activity that is deemed in conflict with our Terms of Service. This information is used in the aggregate, and is never linked back to any personally identifiable information.

2\. Uses of Information

ppnow.com collects the aforementioned personally identifiable information in order to provide you with a service that allows you to maintain an online presence. Various features in our Web site management system will, at your discretion, display your name, or adjust the date and time of events based on your locale. The ppnow.com Website Manager interface will always give you an option before any piece of your personally identifiable information is presented on your web site, and situations where information will be published is made clear in various spots in the interface (for example, your name is tied to welcome emails you send out from our system, and notice of this is given to you within the interface for that tool).

ppnow.com also uses information collected through its service to send out notifications regarding service related issues (such as maintenance periods, billing problems, account expirations, and other items that may impact service). We do not send contact information unless the matter is deemed urgent, and most communication will occur through your ppnow.com Website Manager interface.

Information collected through our service logs is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding web site traffic. This statistical information is not aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.

ppnow.com. is the sole owner of information collected on http://www.ppnow.com/. Your information is never shared, leased or given to any third parties in ways other than disclosed in this privacy statement.

3\. Information Security

We store all user information in secure databases protected via a variety of industry-standard access controls.

This data is accessed only for the purposes specified in this privacy statement.

Removing Information

To remove your personally identifiable information from our system, submit your account for deactivation. Your personal information will be removed immediately, though your actual login name will remain reserved on our system until re-collection.

5\. Communications from ppnow.com.

Like most web sites, we use small bits of data called cookies stored on users' computers to simulate a continuous connection.

Members who disable cookies will not be able to use ppnow.com's services, as they are required to maintain your login to our service within a browser session. Disabling cookies does not prevent you from accessing web sites published under our system, though some features of those sites may be degraded.

These cookies can be tied back to personally identifiable information only in the event that you are logged in to our service. If you are logged in to our service, the cookies on your computer will uniquely identify your account within our system.

This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by ppnow.com. only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. See the 'Third Party Advertisers' section for more details.
