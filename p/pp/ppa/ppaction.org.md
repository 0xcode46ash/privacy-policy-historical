# Planned Parenthood Action Fund Online Privacy Policy - Planned Parenthood Action Center

## Planned Parenthood Action Fund Online Privacy Policy

We at the Planned Parenthood Action Fund want this site to be a safe and private place for users. The Action Fund will do its part by not requiring you to register or provide any information at all to use this website. You can do your part by reading this policy and taking the steps outlined below. We will also update this privacy policy as we deem necessary, so be sure to re-read it from time to time. By submitting information to us, you agree that PPAF may use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## Personal Information You Choose to Provide

To register with our site or to become a member of the Action Fund, you will have to provide some personal information, such as your name, mailing address, and e-mail address. In addition to the required information for membership, your subscription page will give you the option to provide additional information. If you do submit personal information to us, we will use that information for the purposes for which it was submitted. We may also use your information in other ways, such as to contact you about other Planned Parenthood activities and/or fundraising campaigns or as otherwise disclosed to you at the point of collection, and we may share your information with other organizations.

a. If you provide your name, address, and e-mail address by registering with our site, we will have a record of your information.

b. If you choose to register with, donate to, or become a member of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, your information will be added to our list and database.

c. If you register with our site or donate to or become a member of the Action Fund, your information will also be shared with the Planned Parenthood Action Network, and you will receive informational updates and action alerts on reproductive rights issues. The Action Network is an electronic network, and therefore we need an e-mail address to contact you. We also need your full postal address in order for our systems to match you to the correct state and federal districts, thereby ensuring that you are primarily sending messages to your designated elected officials.

d. We will receive and retain a record of any other information you choose to provide, such as optional information you submit.

e. We use third-party vendors to provide services on this site and in our offline business operations. The information that you submit on this site may be provided to those vendors on a confidential basis so that those vendors can provide services (such as maintaining our membership database, sending e-mail messages to members, conducting fundraising campaigns, or processing credit card transactions) on our behalf.

##   
Financial Information You Choose to Provide

If you choose to make an online donation to the Action Fund, you will have to provide your credit card billing information. As this information is collected and transferred over the Internet to our secure server, it is encrypted using SSL, the industry standard security technology that is designed to protect sensitive information. Our donation pages display the Verisign Secure Site Seal to assure you that our website is authentic and that all transactions are secured by SSL encryption. If you are making a one-time donation, the credit card information that you provide at the time of donation is stored only for the duration of the transaction. If you are making a recurring donation, we encrypt your credit card number and store it in our secure database. Your credit card information is used only to process donations and will not be used for any other purposes.

## Information Automatically Collected and Stored

Any website you enter, including <http://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/>, automatically collects and stores some information about your computer and your visit: your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address (this is not your e-mail address); the domain from which you access the Internet (e.g., "AOL.com" or "Princeton.edu"); the name, version, and specifications of your computer and your computer's operating system; the Internet address of the website, if any, from which you came to our site; the date and time you arrived at our site and how long you spent on the site; and which pages you visited.

If you just browse through our site, read pages, or download information, the above information is all that we collect. We use this information to formulate statistics (possibly with the help of outside experts) that show the number of visitors to the different sections of our site and to help us make our site more useful to visitors. For example, we use the browser information to help us design our website so that as many people as possible will be able to view the pages correctly. These statistics do not reveal personal information.

## Use of Cookies

If you choose to provide information by registering with, donating to, or becoming a member of the Action Fund, we may place a small text file, known as a "cookie," on your hard drive so that you will be recognized as you move around the Action Fund pages. Unless you opt-in to use a "persistent cookie," the information is only captured for the duration of your browser session through the use of a "session cookie." For example, if you join the Action Fund and then navigate through different pages of the Action Fund site, the cookie will maintain the information you entered when you filled out the Sign Up page. As you move through the site, any fields requiring information about you that has already been captured will be pre-populated. However, once you close your browser window, the session cookie times out. If you open a new browser window and return to the Action Fund pages, your personal information fields will not be pre-populated.

In certain circumstances, you may be given the option to turn on a "persistent" or "permanent cookie" on your computer (e.g., "Would you like us to remember your password?" messages). A persistent cookie will remember your user name and password and will not time out at the end of your browser session.

## Security

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. The security measures used on this site include, but are not limited to, industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, Versign certificates, firewalls, and internal policies to maintain the security of stored data. 

When you register with, donate to, or become a member of the Action Fund through this website, you will have a personal subscription management page, where you will be able to edit your personal information and recurring donation information, as well as review your messaging, advocacy, and donation records. Access to your personal subscription management page is controlled to protect the privacy of your data — our website requires that you log on with your e-mail address and personal password to access your personal subscription management page. The log-on process may be automated if you choose to accept the placement of a persistent cookie on your PC. See Use of Cookies and Your Help Is Needed for more information on persistent cookies.

Remember, many breaches of security occur when users are not vigilant in protecting their own information. The next section of our privacy policy suggests some actions you can take to help control the security of your personal information.

## Your Help Is Needed

Although we do our best to protect your privacy on <http://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/>, we need your help.

a. You have control over your own privacy. Think carefully before providing any personal or financial information.

b. Although this site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control, no e-mail is completely secure against interception. If you are worried because your communication is very sensitive, do not send it.

c. Remember that we cannot protect your privacy once you leave our site, such as by "hyperlink." So when you visit other websites, check each one's privacy policy yourself, and be careful about the information you offer up.

d. You should be aware that we use personalization measures designed to make your site experience more enjoyable (i.e., personalized links in e-mail that allow pre-population of data fields with certain personal information). We need your help to protect the information embedded in these links. You should always keep your e-mail account information secure and not allow others to access your e-mail account.

e. In addition, you should only forward Action Alert Messages to others through the "Tell a Friend" buttons provided within the e-mail. When you use your e-mail system’s forwarding capabilities (i.e., not "Tell a Friend”), others may be able to take actions in your name and/or access your personal information.

f. You may be given the option to turn on a persistent cookie on your computer (see Use of Cookies above). Remember that once you have set a persistent cookie, anyone can access your personal information by using your computer.

How to Unsubscribe

If you do not want to receive any e-mail from us in the future, visit your personal subscription management page to deactivate your account.  Note that your donation records will remain in the Action Fund’s databases, but your login and e-mail address will be deactivated.
