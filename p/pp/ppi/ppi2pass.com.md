## Privacy Policy

When you request information, a catalog, or literature, enroll in a course or program, or purchase a product from Professional Publications, our order-processing software creates a permanent, historical record containing information ("Personal Information") about you. The software gives you a unique identification number which helps us to track all of your transactions. When you buy a Professional Publications product, we may ask you to return a registration card that comes with the product. If you install software or enroll in an online course, we may ask you to register electronically. When you do, we may merge your registration information with any other information you've already left with us. If you ever want to review or update that information, please contact Professional Publications's [Customer Care Department.](mailto:info@ppi2pass.com) If you haven't already given us your e-mail address, we will ask you to do so. This ensures that only you can access your information.

Professional Publications occasionally shares Personal Information with an affiliated company, the Professional Engineering Institute, which uses the Personal Information to offer you live (classroom) engineering examination preparation classes. All solicitations are by email and postal service only. No other company has access to your Personal Information. Personal Information is never sold or given to any other company.

**Consent:** If you choose not to provide Personal Information, you can still use most of this website. However, you will not be able to enter a complete order, obtain some services, or access some areas.

**Access:** We will help you keep your Personal Information correct and current. You need only contact us and request changes to your Personal Information.

**Security:** Professional Publications takes reasonable steps to protect your Personal Information and honor your choices for its intended use. We have policies and procedures to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

**Enforcement:** If for some reason you believe Professional Publications has not adhered to the principles described herein, please notify us by [email](mailto:info@ppi2pass.com), and we will do our best to determine and correct any problem promptly.

**Cookies:** In some cases, part of your Personal Information may be sent back to and stored on your computer in the form of a cookie. The cookie contains code that is uniquely yours. The stored information (i.e., the cookie) enables seamless travel across ppi2pass.com and its related sites, allowing you to download free software, order free information, and gain access to and use some features without having to provide information you've already provided. If your browser does not accept cookies, you may not be able to access or use all features of this website.
