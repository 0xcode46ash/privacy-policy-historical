Pleygo does not collect any other personally identifiable information that you do not expressly provide. We will never sell, rent or share your personal information, including your e-mail address, with any third parties for marketing purposes without your express permission. Pleygo may share your personal information for the purpose of delivering our e-mail to you or as required by law.

Pleygo may ask you for non-personally identifiable information, such as the age of your children, annual income etc also known as demographic and profile data, but this information is optional, so if you’re not inclined to disclose it, feel free to ignore the requests. Just keep in mind that we may use this data to customize your experience and direct more appropriate sets to you.
