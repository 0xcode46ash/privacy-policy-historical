We only collect information that you freely give us. We may keep a record of the contact details for anyone who subscribes to an e-mail list, enters a competition or promotional feature, writes to, telephones, faxes or e-mails us, unless requested otherwise. We may occasionally use these details to send you information, but will not share the details with other organizations unless necessary to fulfil your request. If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.

**Feedback**  
We do not routinely solicit or collect sensitive personal data about individual visitors. If you voluntarily provide any sensitive data in the context of an essay, a feedback form, an e-mail, or any other medium, please note that this will constitute explicit consent for us to add this data to your record. Of course, we will treat such information with utmost respect. If you select the Consent checkbox when submitting a form on our website, you give us the right to edit and publish your comments in any electronic or print medium and to license Plough Publishing to publish your comments.
