When this privacy policy uses the term "personally identifiable information," we mean information that identifies a particular individual, such as the individual's name, postal address, e-mail address, and telephone number.

##### Information Collected Through Technology

We collect information through technology to make our site more interesting and useful to you. For instance, when you visit our site, we collect your IP address. An IP address is often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet Service Provider) or your company. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable information. At times we also use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which our visitors/customers visit various parts of our site.

Our website also uses "cookies." Cookies are pieces of information that a website sends to your computer while you are viewing the website. We use cookies for a variety of purposes.

You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Safari or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your Web experience smoother, like the features mentioned above, and some of our services will not function properly.

We also use technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our Website, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our Website, length of visits, download errors and page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs).

#### 3\. Why do we collect this information?

We collect the personally identifiable information in order to serve the needs of our visitors and customers. If you are purchasing a product from us and supply us with credit card information, we need to know who you are in order to verify the credit card information you have sent us. The non-personal information that we collect from you is used for internal purposes to make your experience with our site more enjoyable.

#### 4\. How is your information protected?

We use the latest in encryption technology to ensure that any sensitive information that is sent to you by us via the Internet is protected from unauthorized interception. From time to time, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods.
