**How we use "cookies"?**  
A "cookie" is a small file stored on your computer by a Web site that gives you a numeric user ID and stores certain information about your activity on the site. We use cookies to let us know if you are a previous customer and also to provide certain features to you, such as storing information on your product selections as you shop on our site. We do not store any personal or financial information about you (except your name) using cookies. 

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, and most also allow you to instruct your browser to prevent the use of cookies. However, if you disable this feature certain aspects of www.plowhearth.com, such as the shopping basket, will not function properly.

**How we use the information we collect about you?**  
We use information we collect from you to process your orders, to provide an enhanced and more personalized shopping experience and to inform you of offers and discounts from Plow & Hearth, or other sites and companies owned by our parent company, 1800Flowers.com, including HearthSong and Magic Cabin Dolls. In addition, we periodically make such information, including aggregated information, available to selected third parties including but not limited to, those who trade or rent information for direct marketing purposes. 

Plow & Hearth does not make your email addresses available to third parties (except for our parent company 1800Flowers.com and its subsidiaries and subcontractors or agencies acting on our behalf in compliance with this Privacy Policy or any Successor (see Below)), although we may do so in the future. If we do, we will first amend this policy. If you would like us to email you a notice when our Privacy Policy or Terms of Use change, please follow the instructions below. You may instruct us not to share information with third parties by following the instructions provided below. A Successor to our business is not to be considered to be a third party for these purposes (see below). 

In the event of a merger, consolidation, or sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets or business of Plow & Hearth (a "Successor"), one of the assets which would generally be transferred is the information we collect from our customers and members. However, the use of this information by any Successor would still be governed by the terms of this privacy policy, as amended from time to time, including any amendment after such transaction, and you will continue to have the right to opt-out of sharing your information with third parties.

We may disclose any information you provide to Plow & Hearth when we believe disclosure to be appropriate to comply with any law, regulation, or governmental request, or to comply with judicial process; or (ii) if such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to operate this web site; or (iii) to protect the rights or property of Plow & Hearth, its users, Sponsors, Providers, Licensors, or Merchants. 

**Links**  
Plow & Hearth wants you to be aware that when you click on links and/or ad banners that take you to third-party Web sites, you will be subject to the third parties' privacy policies, not ours. While we support the protection of privacy on the Internet, we cannot be responsible for the actions of third parties. We encourage you to read the posted privacy statement and user terms and conditions whenever interacting with, and prior to providing any personal information to, any other Web site. 

**Your Security**

However, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Although we make reasonable efforts to safeguard your personal information once we receive it, we cannot warrant the security of information you transmit to us.
