###   
B.    plista Services

#### 1.    plista Technology on Websites within the plista-Network 

plista Services provide customized recommendations of content and ads to visitors of websites within the plista-network. In doing so, plista compares the interests of visitors of the websites to other users and recommends content based on interests of similar users. Therefore, it is necessary that we can (a) analyze interests and (b) differentiate between individual website visitors. If you visit a website that has implemented plista products, plista will place a cookie with a retention time of one year that includes a randomly assigned identifier.  Thereafter, the cookie will be used to collect information about how our services are accessed or used, including category of content on the site, type of technology/widget, language of the content, browser, operating system, device type and whether you click on or interact with an advertisement or other content (collectively, “Usage Information”). Usage Information does not include names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses or similar personal data.  We may collect your IP address for delivery of advertising and fraud detection, but any such IP addresses are processed and hashed for storage. 

  
As a matter of principle, recommendations do not use personal data. In order to be able to deliver recommendations to website users that fit their interests, we compile the relevant Usage Information into a profile that is associated with a randomly assigned identifier and analyze it. We may also use data provided by our affiliates and third parties to supplement such profiles and assist with recommendations.  For example, our affiliate Xaxis, Inc. operates and maintains a proprietary data management platform that plista may utilize to help deliver Services.

  
You may opt out of customized recommendations via the plista Service on the browser you are using.  For instructions and additional information, please visit our opt-out page -- <https://www.plista.com/opt-out> \-- or [www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/). 

  
We are a member of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) and, in connection with our membership, adhere to the IAB Europe EU Framework for Online Behavioral Advertising in those markets where that self-regulatory framework applies.  For information about interest-based advertising and the choices available to you, and to opt out of third-party interest-based advertisements from us and other participating EDAA member companies via cookies, please click [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/).

2.    Using plista-Services as a Website Operator or Advertiser

If and insofar as personal data are transferred to plista in this context, plista observes the principle of purpose limitation in accordance with applicable data protection law. 

  
We may request personal data for billing and advertising purposes and to implement your monthly online advertising campaign or to market one or more websites. This data will only be collected if you have explicitly agreed, contributed and were sufficiently informed.

####   
3.    Disclosure to Third Parties

We may disclose the information we collect about recipients of Services, and information derived from it, to our affiliates, clients and service providers.  As we do not collect users’ names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses or similar personal data through our Services, we do not disclose any such information to third parties.  However, if you decide to provide personal data via one of our clients’ advertisements or sites, then that information will be received by that client and will be subject to that client’s privacy policy.  

  
In addition, in certain cases, legal requirements and in particular the obligation to protect the legitimate interests of responsible data controllers may require us to disclose data collected through the Services to third parties, inter alia in the event of a suspicion of a crime or abuse. In this case we may be obliged to disclose such data to law enforcement bodies and/or competent courts.
