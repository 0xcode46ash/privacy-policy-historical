Our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy are currently in draft form and may change. We may make material changes to this document and note them _only_ here. 

Your privacy guarantees as a member of the Plum community

This is our privacy and copyright policy. We know you've placed trust in us and expect us to both keep your personal information private and protect your rights to the information you've included in your personal library. We believe that "what's yours is yours." 

This means that your personal information belongs to you, and we will only use it with your permission. When including things of your own creation in your personal library, you retain all rights to them, if you decide to make that content private. However, Plum facilitates the collection of all forms of media and allows (and encourages) the easy sharing of personal libraries of information. So when you choose to share things of your creation in your collections (by making those collections public), you do so with a [Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/) license. 

Your private account information and information we collect passively from you

What this covers:

  * This section deals with the information that is only visible to Plum systems. These are things that other Plum users will never see.
  * This includes details about the information you provide to us during the registration process, as well as your account and collection settings.
  * This also addresses information that we collect "passively" as you use Plum. This is information that ends up in our server and system logs, in cookies we may set, and any other information that's collected through technical means while you are using the Plum service.



The Basics:

  * First and foremost, we want you to know that you own all personal information you provide to Plum. While this information is "deposited" with us, it is and will always remain your property.
  * We will never sell this information, nor will we share it in any form that can identify you individually with third parties who aren't our agents. 
  * If you no longer want to be a member of the Plum community, you can deactivate your Plum account at any time by contacting us by [clicking here.](https://web.archive.org/feedback/p/)
  * If you've deleted your account, some of the "passive" information we've collected may still exist in log files. However, there's no way to link this information to you individually once your account has been deactivated.
  * Plum needs to comply with the law, ensure our service is used legally and for its intended purpose, and make certain that people's lives and well-being aren't threatened because of anything related to Plum. This means that there may be times when we are required to disclose your private information to comply with a valid legal order (for example, a warrant or subpoena), to investigate fraud or egregious misuse of the Plum service, or in situations involving physical harm to any person. 



Your collections and other public information

Your collections have three parts:

  * Information created by you. These are things for which you own the copyright. For example, this might include an original note you author or a photograph you've taken.
  * Information you collect. These are things for which other people own the copyright. For example, this might include an image you find on the web, an article written by another person, or a copy of something in someone else's collections.
  * Comments and ratings made on your collections or those you make on other people's collections.



The Basics:

Information you create:

  * You retain the copyright to information you create that you set to be private.
  * If information you create is set to be public or shareable with a group, it is licensed with a [Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/) license. This means that other people can copy and make derivative works from the information for non-commercial use.
  * Once something has been set to public or group sharable, the license is always [Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/), even if you subsequently change that item to be private. (However, changing the item back to private does restrict further access to the item to yourself.)
  * Information you create that is public or group sharable can be copied by other users and placed in their own personal libraries.
  * You can remove or edit information you create that's in your collections. However, removing or editing your copy of the information will not alter copies of that information that exist in other people's personal libraries.
  * If you deactivate your Plum account, items in your collections that are set to be private will be removed. Items set to be public or group sharable, and copies of items you created in other people's personal libraries, will not be removed.
  * When you put something in your public collections -- and thus make it visible to other Plum users on the Plum site -- we reserve the right to place advertisements or other promotions on the same webpage. Plum currently retains the revenue from these ads and promotions.



Information you collect:

  * If you add something to the collections in your personal library that belongs to someone else (for example, a web page, link, photo, feed, song, or a copy of an item in someone else's collections), they retain all intellectual property rights to it, subject to its license. This means they have the final say on what happens to it and can request the removal of it at any time.*
  * When you add some types of things to your collections, like a photo or a webpage, our system may make a copy of it on Plum's servers. You can see an example of this when you collect a web page and a facsimile of it appears on the Plum site. Although a facsimile of the item appears in your collections, the copyright holder can request removal of it at any any time.* 



* To request the removal of something, or to report a copyright violation, [click here](https://web.archive.org/feedback/p/).

Comments and ratings:

  * When you rate or comment on another user, another user's collection, or an item in another user's collection, your comments are licensed using the [Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/) license.
  * Comments and ratings cannot be changed or deleted. Inappropriate or abusive comments should be reported using the "Report" feature on the offending item.



Account information and passively collected information

  * When you register to use Plum, we collect some basic information from you, including your name, email address, and location. This information is only used for the Plum service to identify you and for aggregate analysis.
  * Plum's service can notify you when things are added to your collections or your friend's collections. If you don't want to receive these emails, you need to deactivate your account. To do so, [contact us.](https://web.archive.org/feedback/p/)
  * When you use the Plum system, we collect some information "passively." This refers to information that is automatically collected by our servers as you are using Plum.
  * This "passively" collected information includes your IP address and several cookies that help our servers identify your web browser and your account (so that other people can't pretend to be you). We use this information for diagnostic purposes and aggregate analysis.
  * In certain places on the Plum site, we may make use of third party advertising servers or web analysis tools. These agents may set other cookies or use "web beacons." However, in no case can the data collected by these agents identify you personally.



Other things you should know

In the event that we add new features to the Plum site that involve issues concerning your rights that aren't covered here or in the documents linked to from here, we will note this where and when that feature appears. We will also clearly explain the issues and give you the ability to consent to any changes involving the privacy settings on your information. 

There may come a time when we need to change this statement of your rights, for example, if Plum is no longer an independent company. In the event that we make any material change to these rights, we'll notify you by putting a prominent notice on the Plum site and giving you the option to deactivate your account if you wish. Plum will also do this if we merge with or are acquired by another entity and your information becomes subject to a different set of policies. What constitutes a "material change" will be determined at Plum's sole discretion, in good faith and using common sense and reasonable judgment. 

What to do if you have a concern or want to report a problem

If you have a question, comment or concern, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/feedback/p/) and we'll be happy to help you out.
