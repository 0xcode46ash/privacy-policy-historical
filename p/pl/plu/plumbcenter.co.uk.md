#### Whats is a Cookie?

A cookie is a small text file stored on your computer when you visit certain web pages. A cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets web site operators know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences. Cookies do not contain personally identifiable information such as your home address, telephone number or credit card details. By using our website, you are agreeing to our Privacy and Cookies Policies and consent to the use of cookies by us as described in these policies. 

#### What cookies do we use?

You can find more information about the individual cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them in the table below. We use the following terminology: 

  * Session cookies – only last for the duration of your browsing session on the website. Your web browser would normally delete these when you close the browser. 
  * Persistent cookies – these last longer than the browser session e.g. if you log into a website and then return to the website some days later, the website knows who you are and displays a welcome message to you. Persistent cookies enable this to happen.
  * First party cookies – these are set by us 
  * Third party cookies – you may notice some cookies that aren't related to us. If you go on to a web page that contains embedded content, for example from YouTube, you may be sent cookies from these websites. We don't control the setting of these cookies, so we suggest you check the third-party websites for more information about their cookies and how to manage them.

**Cookie Name** | **Description and Purpose** | **Session / Persistent** | **First / Third Party**  
---|---|---|---  
WC_SESSION_ESTABLISHED | This cookie is created on the first request processed by WebSphere Commerce runtime. For example, a non-cache request | Session | First Party  
WC_ACTIVEPOINTER | This cookie contains the value of the store ID of the session. This value is used to select the store to execute the command, if one is not specified on the URL. | Session | First Party  
WC_USERACTIVITY_ID | This is a user session cookie that flows between the browser and server over both SSL or non-SSL connection. It is used for user identification over non-SSL connections. It contains user session values such as login timeout, session identifier, etc. | Session | First Party  
WC_GENERIC_ACTIVITYDATA | This cookie only exists if it is a generic user (-1002) session. This cookie stores the session values such as storeid, langid, contracts, etc. | Session | First Party  
WC_AUTHENTICATION_ID | WebSphere Commerce uses a secure authentication cookie to manage authentication data. An authentication cookie flows only over SSL, and has a timestamped signature for increased security. This cookie is used to authenticate the user over SSL-connections. | Session | First Party  
JSessionID | Default Java/JSP cookie that is created/sent when session is created | Session | First Party  
Apache | Default Apache cookie set by the HTTP server | Session | First Party  
WC_PERSISTENT | This cookie is used to persist user ID, language ID, and currency for each store ID visited in the session. Multiple sets of identifiers can exist if the user visits more than one store | Session | First Party  
ltpatoken2 | WebSphere Commerce generates the Lightweight Third Party Authentication (LTPA) cookie, where it can be used by other WebSphere Application Server applications. This enables WebSphere Commerce to be the authentication engine.  
In a single sign-on (SSO) scenario, an HTTP cookie is used to propagate a user's authentication information to disparate Web servers relieving the user from entering authentication information for every new client-server session (assuming basic authentication) | Session | First Party  
WC_timeoffset | Stores the time off set timeoffset between browser time and GMT | Session | First Party  
Brochure Request php_sessionID | Browsers automatically set this when a user visits the site – website visits are inherently disconnected so a site is only able to gauge that user has been to page before [be it two seconds or two months] by the information sent in the browser  request | Session | First Party  
_utma | Used by Google analytics. Stores each user's amount of visits, and the time of the first visit, the previous visit, and the current visit | Persistent | Third Party
