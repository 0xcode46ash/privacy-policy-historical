A cookie is a small piece of data that collects information about how you use the Site, what pages are viewed, and what information is accessed. PLTW uses this nonpersonal information to understand users’ needs and most effectively administer the Site and Services in response to those needs. This Site is directed to and intended for use by adults only. PLTW requires that a user be at least 18 years of age or older to submit personally identifiable information.

Users may wish to contact the Member behind a post directly to seek more information or clarification about a post. Any additional information a Member puts in a post becomes public information which can be viewed by any user of the Site.
