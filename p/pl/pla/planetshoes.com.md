Your Privacy : Encrypting Your Information 

### We use services provided by VeriSign to insure total transaction security.

To guarantee that your order is secure and to protect your privacy, PlanetShoes.com uses 128 bit SSL encryption (industry standard) to code and process your orders. This encrypts your credit card so that it cannot be read as your information travels over the internet. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the payment gateway. SSL is active if you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser). You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https."
