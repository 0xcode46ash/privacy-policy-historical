## (5) Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information Under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

If you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), Platform.sh’s legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy depends on the data we collect and the specific context in which we collect it. For purposes of this Privacy Policy and compliance with GDPR personal information is data about a living individual who can be identified from such data (or from those and other information either in our possession or likely to come into our possession).

Platform.sh may process your personal information because:

  * We need to perform a contract with you 

  * You have given us permission to do so 

  * The processing is in our legitimate interest and it’s not overridden by your rights

  * For payment processing purposes 

  * To comply with applicable law 




## (6) Your Data Protection Rights Under GDPR, Canada’s PIPEDA, and California

**Your Rights Under GDPR:**

If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights. Platform.sh aims to take all reasonable steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of your personal information and data. If you wish to be informed what personal information and data we hold about you and if you want it to be removed from our systems, please contact us. For existing customers, please file a support ticket.

In certain circumstances, you have the following data protection rights:

  * **The right to access, update or to delete the information we have on you**.

Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before responding to such requests.

**Your Rights Under Canada’s PIPEDA (Privacy Rights):**

The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) is the Canadian federal privacy law for private-sector organizations to regulate the way private-sector organizations handle the personal information in a commercial activity.

Under the PIPEDA principles, individuals have the right to know why their personal information is being collected, how their personal information will be used, and to whom their personal information will be disclosed, and to have the ability to ask for access to, or correction of, their personal information. More details on the PIPEDA principles can be found on the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada’s [site](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en).  

  * **Accountability and Openness.** Platform.sh has a designated Security, Compliance, and Data Protection Officer who is accountable for the management of your personal information, including collection, usage, disclosure, retention, and transfer of personal information to third parties for processing.

  * **Consent.** Your individual consent or consent on behalf of the organization is required when we collect, use, or disclose any such personal information. In certain circumstances we may disclose your personal information for legal, medical, or security reasons. If at anytime you wish to withdraw your consent, you will be notified of any account implications. 

  * **Limiting Collection.** Platform.sh collects only the personal information which is necessary for the purposes identified at the time of collection (providing technical support you, and to improve your Services). 

  * **Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention.** Platform.sh does not use or disclose personal information for purposes other than those which it has identified purposes for and received consent for in line with this Privacy Policy and only retains personal information for as long as is necessary to fulfill such purposes. Usage data is generally retained for 14 months or less, except when such information is used for compliance including legal obligation or security, and legitimate business reasons, such as improving Services.

  * **Accuracy and Individual Access.** Your personal information we collect may be deleted, updated and/or completed in your account settings at any time, or you may contact us for assistance with making sure your information is accurate and up-to-date. Most changes will be reflected in your account immediately. Your request for account change or deleted information may be verified or retained if we have legal basis for doing so in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Platform.sh retains usage data for a reasonable period of time to pursue legitimate business interest, for internal analysis purposes. Usage data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, up to 14 months, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Service, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.

We take all reasonable measures to:

  * Protect your personal data and information, and to protect our Services from unauthorized access to, or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of, information we maintain.

  * Ensure that we are in compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other privacy regulations as described in this Privacy Policy.
