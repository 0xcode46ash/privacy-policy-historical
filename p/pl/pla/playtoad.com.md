We collect this information so that we can contact their parent to receive permission to collect such information from the child, to contact the child in the future and to verify their age and for the purposes set forth in the Section entitled "What Information Is Collected?". We will always honor a parent's request for:   
(1) a description of the specific types of personal information collected from their child by Boonty; and   
(2) removal of the information collected about their child from our database.  
If you would like to deactivate your child's account, send an email to [parents @ boonty.com](mailto:parents@boonty.com) explaining that you want to deactivate your child's account. Parents may obtain any Personally Identifiable Information collected from their child by sending an email to [parents @ boonty.com](mailto:parents@boonty.com) requesting the Personally Identifiable Information. Boonty will obtain verifiable parental consent for the collection, use or disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information from a child.
