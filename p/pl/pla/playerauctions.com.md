**OUR PRIVACY POLICY OUTLINED**

**Required Information**

In order to use Player Auctions services, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration we require name, email address, mailing address, phone, and the creation of a unique password. Contact information is used only to identify a user and ensure fraud protection and security. Unique identifier information is used to qualify for and set up a Player Auctions Account. Credit card and checking account information is required to use specific services of Player Auctions and is used only to process those transactions initiated by the user. 

**Disclosure of Information**  
Player Auctions will protect the personal information that you share with us. Contact and demographic information is not shared with third parties without prior permission from the user. If you make a transaction that requires credit card and checking account information, we use that information only to process your payment request and will not use it for marketing purposes. When required, we may also disclose information to regulatory agencies, including the Visa and MasterCard Association. 

We may disclose personal information when required by law or in good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on our web site. 

**Security**  
This web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, their information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number, address, phone number), that information is encrypted and is protected. While on a secure page, such as our registration form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about our security, follow this link: [https://digitalid.verisign.com/cgi-bin/Xquery.exe?Template=authCertByIssuer&form_file=../fdf/authCertByIssuer.fdf&issuerSerial=04705d9f6f14ecda746146eed920c1cf](https://digitalid.verisign.com/cgi-bin/Xquery.exe?Template=authCertByIssuer&form_file=../fdf/authCertByIssuer.fdf&issuerSerial=04705d9f6f14ecda746146eed920c1cf)

While we use VeriSign encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (our database administrator and customer service representatives) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. The servers that store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. 

If you have any questions about the security at our web site, please email webmaster@playerauctions.com 

**Cookies**  
Our site uses cookies only to track referrals from our affiliates who have joined our affiliate programs and to identify a user when they return to our site. 

**Links**  
This web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this site. 

**Email Links**  
We use email links located on the "contact us" page to allow you to contact us directly with any questions or comments. We read every message sent in and try to reply promptly to every one. This information is used to respond directly to your questions or comments. We may also file your comments to improve the site and program, or we may review and discard the information. 

**Newsletter and Promotions**  
We send all new members a welcoming email. Established members will receive information on special promotions and a newsletter, including product and service updates. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please refer to the "Opting Out" section below. 

Player Auctions may occasionally present a special promotion. To qualify for entry, we may ask you to provide personal information. If we plan to share that information with any sponsor(s), we will provide a statement to that effect. 

**Opting Out**  
Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of receiving further information from us about special promotions or product updates. Our registration form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who sign up for the service, but don't want any marketing material or product updates, can keep their email address off of our lists. 

Users who no longer wish to receive service updates or promotional materials from Player Auctions may opt-out of receiving these communications by emailing customerservice@playerauctions.com 

**Surveys**  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information and demographic information. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of our service and/or this site. 

**Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post a notification of these changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. 

**How to Update Your Personal Information**  
You can help Player Auctions maintain the accuracy of your personal information by notifying us or updating your personal profile when you change your address, mailing address, phone numbers, or email address. If at any time you wish to update your information, you are provided with the means to update your information through "My Auctions" or you can contact Player Auctions by email at customerservice@playerauctions.com or by postal mail at: 

Player Auctions  
2457 152ND AVE NE
