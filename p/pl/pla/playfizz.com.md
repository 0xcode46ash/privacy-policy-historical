# PlayFizz | Privacy Policy

**Website Privacy Policy**

**1\. Introduction**

The following sets forth the Privacy Policy of GPV Entertainment, LLC (“Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”), which operates PlayFizz.com (the “Website”), and is designed to inform you about the information we collect and how we maintain this information. We value the trust you place in us and we are committed to safeguarding your privacy. By use of this Website, communications to or with us or use of any of our services, you are agreeing to these terms. If you do not agree with any of these terms in this Privacy Policy, please exit the Website and do not submit information to us in any way. 

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Before using this Website and the Service (as defined below), recheck this page and review the “Effective Date” posted on the bottom of this Privacy Policy. If it has recently changed, make sure you review it and still agree with its terms. It will apply to any interactions you have with the Website and Service, and information you provide to us related to your use of the Website and Service. Your continued use of the Website or Service, or communications with us will evidence your agreement to the terms thereof. 

Please read this document carefully before accessing or using the Website or Service. Your access to the Website or Service constitutes you acceptance to this Privacy Policy. If you do not understand or agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Website or Service. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please let us know by contacting us at [support@playfizz.com](mailto:support@playfizz.com).

Our Website also offers users Platinum Games (“Platinum Games”) free of charge for users to play, but requires the download and installation of the PlayFizz software (the “Service”). In exchange to play the Platinum Games at no cost, the Service allows the Company to display a restricted amount of advertisements on your website browser, including but not limited to in-text, pop-up, banner, in-image and interstitial advertisements. The Website may also display third party applications and advertisements on the site itself and/or within the games you play. All such applications and advertisements served to you through the Service and/or the Website are defined collectively as “Third Party Ads”. For the avoidance of doubt, the Service does not collect any Personally Identifiable Information (as defined in Section 2). 

The Website collects two types of information: Personally Identifiable Information (as described in Section 2) and Non-personally Identifiable Information (as described in Section 3). The Service only collects Non-personally Identifiable Information and does not collect Personally Identifiable Information. 

**2\. Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”)**

PII is any data or information about an individual that can be used to identify that specific person, such as a name, telephone number or email address. We collect your PII when you reach out to us through our support email address ([support@playfizz.com](mailto:support@playfizz.com)) or the “Contact” page; we will ask you to submit your name, email address, and phone number so that we can respond to your inquiry. 

We do not sell or license your PII to third parties without your consent, except as disclosed herein and if we enter into a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of our assets, or transfer the Website or services provided therewith to any third-party, your PII will be shared and transferred as part of that transaction. 

We share your PII (to the extent we have such information) only with those involved in providing services, functions or professional advice as outlined below, including but not limited to our parent company and its officers, principals, employees, consultants, directors, agents, subsidiaries and/or affiliates (collectively, “Affiliate Companies”). We and/or our Affiliate Companies may use vendors to provide certain services or functions necessary to operate our Website and offer and deliver products and services to you. We share information with those third-parties and vendors to the extent necessary for them to perform their function on our behalf. All of these third-parties must agree to protect the privacy and security of our users and not to use information they receive during the course of their duties for any purpose other than for which it was provided. 

We and/or our Affiliate Companies may also disclose your PII to third parties as required or permitted by law, or as we believe may be necessary (as determined in our sole and absolute discretion) to protect the integrity of our Website, or the safety, privacy and well-being of ourselves and our Affiliate Companies. 

If you would like to update or modify your PII, or request to remove your account from our systems, you may do so by contacting us at [support@playfizz.com](mailto:support@playfizz.com). However, we may retain your PII only as necessary due to situations described above. 

**3\. Non-personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”)**

Non-PII is any data or information, including metrics and statistics, that does not by itself identify a specific individual, such as the type of browser, operating system, visitor views on the Website, and your IP address. We collect Non-PII for each Website interaction and visit, whether you were referred to our Website by a search engine (including the search terms used to find us) or a link from another site, to help us better understand how our Website is being used, to improve our services to you, and to make your experience on our Website more enjoyable. 

We and/or our Affiliate Companies may disclose your Non-PII to third parties as required or permitted by law, to third party advertisers described below and/or as we believe may be necessary (as determined in our sole and absolute discretion) to protect the integrity of our Website, or the safety, privacy and well-being of ourselves and our Affiliate Companies. 

We accept Third Party Ads from third party advertisers and networks. You are solely interacting with a third party and not with the Company when clicking on any Third Party Ads. Please note that the Service and such third party advertisers and networks who deliver Third Party Ads to you via the Service and/or Website may use cookies and other web-tracking technologies to collect Non-PII about you in order to deliver ads that may likely be of greater interest to you. No PII identifying you is collected through the Service or Third Party Ads unless you directly provide it to the applicable party. We recommend that you review the terms of use and privacy policy for any Third Party Ads with which you are interacting before doing so. Their privacy policy, not ours, will apply to any of those interactions. 

In addition, you may have the ability to opt out of certain Third Party Ads by following the opt-out instructions from the applicable link included in the unit of such Third Party Ads. If you choose to opt-out, a cookie will be placed on your computer by the Service but you will still receive other Third Party Ads and be able to play Platinum Games. Please note however, the Third Party Ads will re-appear automatically if you refresh or delete your cookies. 

Certain third party advertisers are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). If you no longer wish to receive Third Party Ads served by NAI members based on your online behavior and activities, you may opt out of such ads via placement of an opt-out cookie, and NAI members will accordingly no longer collect your Non-PII. If however you refresh or delete the opt-out cookie from your browser, or purchase or use a different computer, you will have to reset your browser settings through NAI. For the avoidance of doubt, you will still receive Third Party Ads from third party advertisers who are not members of the NAI. Please go to <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>if you would like more information or to opt-out of Third Party Ads served by NAI members. 

**4\. Links to Third Party Sites**

We link to outside websites and services from time to time. While we try to select appropriate sites, note that we are not responsible for the practices, content or the privacy policies employed by third party sites. Please review those before interacting with those sites. 

**5\. Cookies**

In addition to information you voluntarily provide to us, we collect certain data automatically when you access the Website. We collect this using cookies and other web-tracking technologies and use this to learn about how our Website is used and how to improve the user experience. Furthermore, as explained earlier, the Service will place a cookie on your computer if you choose to opt-out of certain Third Party Ads. However, such Third Party Ads will re-appear automatically if you refresh or delete your cookies. If such Third Party Ads re-appear, please follow the same opt-out procedure. 

**6\. Uninstall**

If you would like to uninstall the software and stop the Service (including all Third Party Ads) at any time, please follow the uninstall instructions [here](http://playfizz.com/uninstall/). 

**7\. Your California Privacy Rights**

Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal customer information we share with third parties or corporate affiliates for those third parties or corporate affiliates' direct marketing purposes. That notice will identify the categories of information shared and will include a list of the third parties and affiliates with which it was shared, along with their names and addresses. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request by email to [support@playfizz.com](mailto:support@playfizz.com). Please allow 30 days for a response. **

**8\. Privacy of Children**

We do not knowingly collect any PII from children under the age of 13. In the event that we learn that we have inadvertently gathered PII from children under the age of 13, we will take reasonable measures to promptly erase such information from our records. **  
**

**9\. Security Measures**

We have systems in place to enforce the terms of this Privacy Policy and secure your data. But, no matter how careful we are, no system is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee that there will be no unauthorized use or access of your information. If we become aware of any information breach that may affect you, we will notify you promptly following our discovery thereof. Should you suspect that there is a security breach or someone is attempting to circumvent our security system, please contact us at [support@playfizz.com](mailto:support@playfizz.com). 

If you have questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please email us at [support@playfizz.com](mailto:support@playfizz.com). You can also write to us at 2370 Market Street, Suite 141, San Francisco, CA 94114. Please note that whether or not you have questions or comments, use of our Website indicates your agreement to the terms hereof as written.
