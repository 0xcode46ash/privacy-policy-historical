# Playtopus – Privacy Policy

**Playtopus Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains what information Playtopus, which is owned by EpicPlay LLC, (referred to herein as “Playtopus”, “Company” or “we”) collects from individuals who visit the Playtopus.com website (the “Site” or “Playtopus”) and/or participate in the resources offered by Playtopus (“User(s)” or “you”). This Policy also explains how the Company uses and maintains that information.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this Policy, the Playtopus home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

We reserve the right to update or modify this Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on the Playtopus home page.

This Policy applies only to information collected on Playtopus and not to information collected or obtained from other sources.

We collect two kinds of information through the Site. The first kind is information that can identify you as a specific individual – such as your name and email address (“PII”). We only collect PII when you have contacted us directly or forwarded content from the Site to someone else. (See “Collection of Personally Identifiable Information” below). The second kind of information is the kind of non-personally identifiable information (“NPII”) collected and stored automatically by many websites. It includes, for example, information about your Internet service provider, operating system, type of browser, geographic location, and pages viewed on the Site. Although this information is related to you, it is not associated with your PII and cannot be linked to you personally. If you register to play “Premium Games”, the NPII collected may also include your IP address and HTML information about the content of web pages you visit.

If you do not want your information to continue to be collected and used as provided in this Policy, you should not access or use the Site again.

Premium Game players (“Premium User(s)”) have access to the Premium Games at no charge in exchange for their agreement to install the Playtopus software (the “Software”) on their computers or other computing device. The Software allows us to provide a User with a limited amount of text link, popup/under, floating and transitional advertisements based on the web content viewed by that User. No PII is collected through the Software.

**Collection of Personally Identifiable Information**

PII is collected by Playtopus only when you provide it to us by using one of the following Site features:

  * When you communicate with us via the “Contact Us” page, Playtopus asks for your name, phone number and email address so that you can receive a response.
  * When you use our “Send Game to Friend” feature, Playtopus collects the name and email address of you and your friend. We will only send your friend a onetime email inviting them to visit the site and check out the game that you sent them. We do not retain their PII for any purpose.



We do not collect any PII when games are submitted.

Social Media (Features) and Widgets:

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

If you do not want us to collect your PII as described above or to use and share your PII as described further below in this Policy, you should NOT provide it to us through any of the Playtopus features described above. By providing us with your PII using any of these features, you are authorizing our use and sharing of your PII as described in this Policy and any subsequent revisions to this Policy that we may publish on the Site.

**Updating Your Personally Identifiable Information.**

If your PII changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend, or remove it by emailing our Customer Support at [info@playtopus.com](mailto:info@playtopus.com) or by contacting us using our contact form at [Contact page](https://web.archive.org/contact/).

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at[ info@playtopus.com](mailto:info@playtopus.com). We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

**Children’s Privacy**

Playtopus and the content available or emails delivered in connection with Playtopus, are neither intended for, nor directed to, nor to be accessed by, persons under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect PII from anyone under 13 years of age. We cannot and will not independently verify that all of our users are at least 13 years old, but we will remove from our files any PII of anyone we discover to be under 13 years old.

**Use and Sharing of Personally Identifiable Information**

We reserve the right to use PII: (1) for the specific purpose for which such information was provided as stated above; (2) for the purposes disclosed at the time such information is provided; or (3) as disclosed in this Policy.

We do not share, sell or trade any of your PII with any third parties other than described herein. We may share your PII with our parent company and companies owned by our parent company (collectively “Related Companies”). Neither we nor our Related Companies contribute to or participate in cooperative databases, which give other companies access to your PII.

We and our Related Companies may provide access to your PII when legally required to do so, to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site, to limit our legal liability and protect our rights or to protect the rights, property or safety of other users or the public.

We and/or our Related Companies may also disclose your PII to outside companies and consultants that help bring you the services we offer. For example, we and our Related Companies may work with outside companies and consultants to: (a) manage a database of customer information; (b) assist in distributing e-mails; (c) assist with direct marketing and data collection; (d) provide data storage and analysis; (e) provide fraud prevention; (f) provide customer service by phone; (g) manage our sweepstakes and contests; and/or (h) provide other services designed to assist us in maximizing our business potential and maintaining our Site. We and our Related Companies require that these outside companies and consultants agree to keep confidential all information we share with them, and use the information only to perform their obligations to us.

In addition, if we or our Related Companies go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your PII will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified by a prominent notice on the Playtopus home page of any such change in ownership or control of your PII. We also reserve the right to disclose PII as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

As with many websites, when you visit Playtopus, Playtopus automatically gathers certain NPII based on your computer information and stores it in log files. This type of technical and statistical information is used to customize your experience at Playtopus, to help us improve the quality of Playtopus and to make your visits to Playtopus easy, convenient and fun. Playtopus also collects your IP address to help diagnose problems with the Site server and for Site administration purposes.

In addition to the general collection of NPII by the Site (including, but not limited to, IP address, browser type, operating system version, time and date stamp, and landing page), the Software downloaded by Users tracks URLs, HTML, web pages and/or search queries on the web pages visited in order to deliver ads in the form of text link, popup/under, floating and transitional advertisements which appear when online generally. An average of six or fewer ads per day will be shown based on the web content viewed. If at any time, a Premium User no longer wants the Software to collect NPII or to deliver customized advertising, s/he may deactivate the Software which will uninstall the Software and its associated monitoring technologies. The directions for uninstalling the Software are set forth below in the section entitled “Deactivate Software.”

**Cookies**

Playtopus uses “cookies” and similar means to collect aggregate Internet traffic statistics and to enhance your experience at the Site. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Playtopus uses cookies to recognize your preferences, temporarily store session information (such as your login to a download or support area), and to remember you when you register for our products and/or services. This helps save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information and to display your customized content and advertising on your later visits to the Site. It also allows you to move from page to page at the Site without having to sign in again on each page. If you do not want Playtopus to deploy cookies in your browser, you can set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when a website tries to put a cookie in your browser software. If you choose to decline cookies, however, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Site and it may affect your ability to use some of the products and/or services at the Site. We do not tie any PII to the cookies that we set.

**Third Party Cookies**

The use of cookies by our third party advertisers as well as third party ad servers is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. These third parties use session ID cookies to gather anonymous information.

**Web Beacons**

The Site may contain electronic images known as “web beacons” which are also sometimes called single-pixel gifs. Web beacons may be used to assist in delivering cookies, allow us to count users who have visited the Site pages and to deliver services via the Site. We may also include web beacons in email messages or newsletters you agree to receive in order to determine whether such messages have been opened and acted upon. If any partner advertises on our website, we may work with them to place web beacons on their website to allow Playtopus to collect statistics on how often clicking on those advertisements on our website results in a purchase or other action on such partner’s website. Playtopus may also employ web beacons from third party partners in order to help compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations of the Site. Playtopus will never allow web beacons on the Site to be used by third parties to collect or access your personal information. We do not tie web beacons to any PII you submit while on our Site.

**Use and Sharing of Non-Personally Identifiable Information (NPII)**

We share NPII with our business partners in order to customize the services they and Playtopus provide to you. And of course, we may also disclose any of the NPII collected through Playtopus or the Software in order to (1) comply with applicable laws, (2) respond to governmental inquiries, (3) comply with valid legal process, or (4) protect our rights and property or that of or our Users.

**Security**

We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures to protect Information from unauthorized access and improper use. We keep information on servers that are protected by firewalls and located in a physically secure facility accessible only to authorized employees. From time to time, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware though, that, despite our reasonable efforts, no security measures are impenetrable and any connection to Playtopus or information transmitted to us or to Playtopus will be at your own risk.

**Opt-Out of Playtopus Emails**

If you are receiving emails from Playtopus, it is because we understood from your participation on our Site that you were interested in receiving ongoing information from us. If at any point you no longer want to receive emails from Playtopus, you may at any time go to the Unsubscribe page on Playtopus and follow the “opt out” directions there. If you have any questions about the opt-out process, you can contact us at [privacy@playtopus.com](mailto:privacy@playtopus.com). Also, please note that if we have already shared your information with one of our business partners, unsubscribing from our list will not prevent these third parties from emailing you. You will have to send an opt-out request to those third parties directly. Opportunities to “opt out” from receiving emails are usually found on these companies’ websites or within each of their email communications.

**Links from the Site**

Playtopus provides links to the websites of many of our business partners. If you link to any of these third party web sites, our Policy will not apply to your use of, and activities on, those sites. We encourage you to read the legal notices posted on these web sites, including their privacy policies. We shall have no responsibility or liability for your visitation to, and the data collection and use practices of, these sites. All inquiries concerning the use of PII by a third party must be communicated to that third party and not to Playtopus.

**Deactivate Software**

Premium Users who have downloaded the Software and who do not want their NPII collected as described above should immediately deactivate the Software. You may deactivate the Software by going to [Deactivate page](https://web.archive.org/deactivate/) and following the directions to remove the Software from your computer, or by selecting the appropriate entry in your Control Panel using the “Add or Remove Programs” icon. Deactivating the Software means that you will no longer have access to the Premium Games on the Site.

**Your California Privacy Rights**

Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal customer information we share with third parties or corporate affiliates for those third parties or corporate affiliates’ direct marketing purposes. That notice will identify the categories of information shared and will include a list of the third parties and affiliates with which it was shared, along with their names and addresses. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request by email to [privacy@playtopus.com](mailto:privacy@playtopus.com).
