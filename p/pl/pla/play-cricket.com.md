ABOUT US

play-cricket.com (the **Website** ) is part of the play-cricket network ( **Play Cricket Site Network** ) of sites which includes a number of sub sites ( **Sub Sites** ) that are administered by English County Cricket Boards, cricket clubs and other organisations ( **Cricket Organisations** ).

The Website is operated by the England and Wales Cricket Board Limited ( **ECB** ), the UK governing body for cricket. The ECB is the data controller in respect of all personal data collected on this Website which means that we are responsible for ensuring that we do so in full compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and all other related privacy laws.

This privacy policy explains what information we collect about you, how we use it, and the steps we take to ensure that it is kept secure. We also explain your rights and how to contact us.

#### Links to other websites

Please note, this Website contains links to other websites (including the Sub Sites of Cricket Organisations in the Play Cricket Site network). These links are provided for your convenience. We are only responsible for the privacy practices and security of this Website. We recommend that you check the privacy and security policies and procedures of each and every other website and Sub Site that you visit.

BY USING THIS WEBSITE AND GIVING PERSONAL INFORMATION TO US OR TO ANY CRICKET ORGANISATIONS THROUGH THEIR SUB SITES, YOU INDICATE THAT YOU CONSENT TO THE ECB, THE CRICKET ORGANISATIONS AND ECB PARTNERS COLLECTING AND USING THIS PERSONAL INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS SET OUT IN THIS POLICY

CHILDREN

If you are under 18, you will need the permission of your parent or guardian before registering on our Website(s) or any Sub Sites and we will require your parent or guardian to confirm that they have given permission. We may ask for their contact details so that we can check that they have done so and may carry out checks to confirm that the details you have given us are correct.

We normally only send newsletters and offers and opportunities to children where their parent or guardian has given consent to them being sent. Your parent or guardian can change their mind at any time (see ‘Newsletters, Offers and Opportunities’ below).

THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

In order to provide you with the services you require, the ECB will obtain personal information about you from our Website, telephone conversations, emails and written and verbal communications and from Sub Sites. These will include, for example, your name, address, email address, phone number and details that are relevant to the service(s) in which you are interested. Occasionally we may ask for date of birth, for example, where the service you require has age related restrictions or ethnicity information to enable us to monitor and ensure compliance with anti-discrimination policies.

We may supplement the information that you provide with other information that we obtain from our dealings with you or which we receive from other organisations, such as [Cricketing Organisations](http://www.ecb.co.uk/information/ecb-site-directory) and [ECB Partners](http://www.ecb.co.uk/ecb/partners/).

CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

Privacy laws and practice are constantly developing and we aim to meet high standards. Our policies and procedures are, therefore, under continual review.

UPDATING AND CORRECTING INFORMATION

You may update or correct your personal information online in relevant membership areas or by contacting us in writing or by email (see the section "How to contact us" below). Please include your name, address and/or email address when you contact us as this helps us to ensure that we accept amendments only from the correct person.

If you are providing updates or corrections about another person, we may require you to provide us with proof that you are authorised to provide that information to us.

YOUR RIGHTS TO ACCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

You have the right to receive a copy of the personal information that we hold about you. The same right applies to any other person whose personal information you provide to us. We may charge a small fee towards the cost of administering any request made. The current fee is £10.00.
