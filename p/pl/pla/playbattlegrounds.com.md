# Privacy Policy – PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Please read our privacy policy carefully.

Bluehole, Inc. (“Bluehole”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information that you may provide us during your participation in our Tester Group.

YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY IS A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION IN OUR TESTER GROUP (“A GROUP OF TESTERS PARTICIPATING IN OUR GAME TEST”) AND USE OF THE SITE (THE “SITE”). BY USING THE SITE AND YOUR PARTICIPATION IN OUR TESTER GROUP, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY’S TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  
PERSONAL INFORMATION

To participate in our Tester Group and in order for you to register for an account, Bluehole may require you to provide us with certain information including your full name, address, nickname, date of birth, e-mail address, and additional information required by Bluehole. Bluehole does not collect any Personal Information from you unless you provide it to Bluehole voluntarily. If you refuse to divulge your Personal Information when requested, you may not be able to participate in our Tester Group.

NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION  
In addition to the above information, Bluehole may collect certain non-Personal Information about your use of our Site and participation in our Tester Group. We might collect, among other things, information concerning the type of Internet browser or computer operating system you are using, the domain name of your Internet service provider, your browsing behavior through the Site, and the web site or advertisement that was linked to or from the Site when you visited. To do this, we may use cookies and other technology (see below). Your visits to the Site, and information provided through these technologies, will be anonymous unless you provide us with Personal Information or have provided such information in the past. This information is used to help improve the Site, analyze trends, and administer the Site.

COOKIE DATA  
Bluehole may use cookies (small text files stored on a participant’s computer) and other passive data collection techniques to gather data regarding individuals’ interaction with our Site, our services, and participation in the Tester Group. We use the data gathered through cookies to provide event initiators with statistical data regarding event participation.

STATISTICAL AND USAGE DATA  
When you use the Site, we may retrieve information about your hardware system and how our services are used, including your IP address. We use this information to enable you to use the services offered through the Site over the Internet. We also use this information to better understand the behavior and preferences of our Testers, so that we can improve our products and services.

ANONYMOUS SINGULAR SUMMARY AND AGGREGATE STATISTICAL INFORMATION  
Personal demographic and profile data regarding our Testers is only shared with our employees, affiliates or our partner on an aggregate basis. Anonymous singular and aggregate statistical summary information is data that describes the interest profile and demographics data of a Tester without specifically identifying the individual. This data does not contain personally identifying information such as a name or e-mail address, nor does the combination of data make it possible to identify you.

PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION  
We do not share, sell, rent or trade personally identifiable information with third parties for any purpose.  
However we reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served.

CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13  
Because the Site and the Tester Group is not directed to children under the age of 13, we prohibit registration to persons under age 13. If you are under the age of 13, you may not create an account on the Site. We will not knowingly collect, maintain, or disclose any Personal Information from children under the age of 13.

CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY  
We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will also revise the “last updated” date at the top of this Privacy Policy, and may attempt to notify you by email, pop-up screen, or by means of a notice somewhere else on the Site. Your continued use of the Site will signify your acceptance of the changes to our Privacy Policy.
