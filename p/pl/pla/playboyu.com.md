This Policy explains what information we collect about you and what we do with it. We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time, and we will notify you of any material changes to the Policy by posting the new Policy here and changing the "Effective Date" at the top. We encourage you to check this page periodically for any changes.

We generally collect this personal information when you sign up to create your profile on Playboy U. We may also collect information about you from time to time through our online surveys if you choose to participate.

We collect and keep track of content and messages that you have uploaded on Playboy U. We will also facilitate the storage of email addresses in our users' internal Playboy U address books.

We collect IP addresses and anonymous demographic information (such as your zip code and browser type) and may use this data to: tailor your experience on Playboy U; provide content in which we think you may be interested; display content according to your preferences; and analyze traffic to Playboy U.

Playboy U is built on a platform managed by a company called Ning. By joining Playboy U, you are also registering for an account with Ning.

You can direct any concerns regarding their use of your information to their webmaster.

Playboy makes every effort to not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 18, or to knowingly allow such persons to register for Playboy U. No one under 18 is allowed to provide or post any personal information on Playboy U or to Playboy. In the event we learn such information has been collected, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
