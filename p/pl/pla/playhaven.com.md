# Privacy Policy | PlayHaven

Last Revised: August 4, 2011 

This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by Medium Entertainment, Inc., doing business as “PlayHaven” ("PlayHaven ", "we" or "us") when you access the PlayHaven web site at [www.PlayHaven.com](http://www.playhaven.com/) (the "Site") or interact with the PlayHaven advertising platform (the " PlayHaven Platform"). The PlayHaven Platform enables PlayHaven to serve advertisements ("Ads") from advertisers that are part of the PlayHaven network (“Advertisers”) through mobile applications ("Applications") operated by third party publishers (“Publishers”). The Site, PlayHaven Platform, Ads, and the Applications are collectively referred to as the “Services”. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use the Services. 

**We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the Policy the date it was revised. We encourage you to review this Policy from time to time to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.** Your continued use of the Services following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. 

What Is Personal Information?

As used herein, the term "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, or credit card number), or information about that individual that is directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Services or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information. 

What Information Do We Collect?

We may collect information in a number of ways when you use Applications or visit our Site: 

Active Collection:

We collect certain information when you voluntarily provide it, such as if you send us an email, fill out a form, post comments or other content, or otherwise provide or request information. This may include when you provide information in connection with an Ad in the Application. Such information may include personal information, such as your name, user name, email, address, telephone number, and other contact and demographic information. Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with leaving comments, posting content, sending an email or message to another user, or participating in any interactive forums or features on the Services. In addition, from time to time we may collect demographic, contact, or other personal information you provide in connection with your participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional offers, and other activities on the Services. 

Passive Collection

When you use the Services, some information is also automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring web site, and your activity on the Site. When you view an Ad while accessing or using an Application, we may automatically collect your device type and IP address as well as the unique device identifier ("UDID") for your mobile device. We also may collect information about your use and activity on the Application and the PlayHaven Platform. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.

We may also automatically collect certain information and monitor user activity through the use of "cookies" or web beacons (also known as web bugs, pixel tags, tracking pixels, clear gifs, or by monitoring a user’s UDID) either on the Services or in Ads served in Applications. If we link cookies to any personally identifying information, we will treat this information as personal information. The web beacons we use do not collect any personal information If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies on the Services, please refer to your browser manufacturer to learn about these functions. However, if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect certain features on the Services. Information provided by cookies, web beacons, UDID’s or other devices may be used, among other things, to analyze data, to determine the popularity of certain content, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests, to make recommendations to you and to better understand the usage and visitation of the Services and the effectiveness of Ads.

For some features of the Services, you may be able to submit information about other people. For instance, if you wish to send a coupon or advertisement to a friend you may submit some of your friend’s personal information. PlayHaven will use any such information that we collect from you about another person to carry out your request. We may also share such information with our Advertising Partners for them to carry out your request.

Third parties may also use cookies, web beacons or other devices to collect information when you use the Services. PlayHaven does not control any cookies or other data collection tools that may be placed on the Services or in Ads or Applications by a third party, including Publishers or Advertisers, and this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of such cookies and/or other data collection tools by any third party. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the Applications you use to find out more about the information that may be collected by third parties and the choices you have regarding the collection, use and sharing of such information. 

Active Collection

We collect certain information when you voluntarily provide it, such as if you send us an email, fill out a form, post comments or other content, or otherwise provide or request information. This may include when you provide information in connection with an Ad in the Application. Such information may include personal information, such as your name, user name, email, address, telephone number, and other contact and demographic information. Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with leaving comments, posting content, sending an email or message to another user, or participating in any interactive forums or features on the Services. In addition, from time to time we may collect demographic, contact, or other personal information you provide in connection with your participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional offers, and other activities on the Services. 

Information Received From Third Parties

We may also obtain certain non-personal information about you from third parties, including our Publishers or Advertisers. This information may include demographic, geographic, psychographic and other usage information that does not personally identify an individual user and may be associated with an anonymous device ID. The collection and use of this information is pursuant to such third party's information collection practices, which are typically outlined in a privacy policy like this one, provided on the third party's website or in the Application.
