We respect your privacy. This is why we have taken the time to disclose our information collection practices and our privacy policy. Please take the time to review this document.

What information do we collect and why?  
We only use the information you give us to process your order and provide a quick and convenient service to you in the future.

Use of Cookies  
Play.com uses "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that most major Web sites write to your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow Play.com to improve your user experience, for example by remembering viewing preferences or displaying your recently viewed items. Play.com does not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Play.com does not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any third parties whatsoever.

Who has access to the information we collect?  
We do not sell mailing lists to other companies, or divulge any of your personal details to other companies or individuals, unless it is to comply with legal requirement (for example, we are required to pass the details of any UK customers buying a television to the TV licensing authority).

How is your information kept secure?  
When you type in credit card information to the Play.com web site our secure servers ensure all details are encrypted at your browser before they are sent to us. While your order is being processed we store your personal details on our in-house servers. Our database is encrypted and the processing servers are not connected to the internet.
