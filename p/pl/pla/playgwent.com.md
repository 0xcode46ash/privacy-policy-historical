 **INFORMATION ABOUT THE STORAGE OF YOUR PAYMENT DETAILS:**

A quick word about payment details (if/when you use them in Gwent): this is a matter for the relevant platform and payment method/processor. We will not receive or store any of your payment details. If you make in-game purchases within Gwent, then we are notified by the payment processor once a transaction takes place and of course we make sure you receive your in-game purchase, but we will not receive any of your actual payment details 

We may collect certain information when you use Gwent (more information opposite).

We will store your information in Europe. We will do our best to keep this information secure.

No information security system is perfect so be careful.

### 8 HOW IS YOUR INFORMATION USED?

8.1 Your information may be used in the following ways:

• To ensure that Gwent is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your device from which you access Gwent.  
• To provide you with marketing information, products or services that you request from us and which we feel may interest you – for example, we may send you newsletters or emails about Gwent (of course, it’s optional and we will ask you for permission first where required).  
• To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts between you and us.  
• To allow you to participate in interactive features of Gwent when you choose to do so.  
• To notify you about changes to Gwent.  
• To improve or modify Gwent. To provide, maintain, protect and improve Gwent and to protect CD PROJEKT RED and other Gwent users and as necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or other similar legal obligations around the world.  
• To calculate conversion rates and other elements of Gwent performance.

8.2 We might share some aggregated and general non-personal information on user behaviour (e.g. sales per region) with our partners who work with us to provide Gwent to you (for example, with payment providers) in order to support, improve or amend Gwent. We may also share non-personal information with data analysis services to help us run Gwent.

We will use your information to run Gwent and keep improving it as well as to communicate with you (e.g. with newsletters or emails).

Sometimes we may have to share anonymised, non-personal information like operating system types in order to run our services. Fear not, as mentioned it would be anonymised, so you could never be identified.

### 9\. HOW YOU USE YOUR INFORMATION

9.1 Please remember that any communications you have via Gwent may reveal details about you. Also, any information you post publicly will be publicly available to other people. We are not responsible for your use of any otherwise private personal information which you make available, or the activities of other users or other third parties to whom you give or make available your information or content.

You have the option to share your own personal information with others. Be careful about it – it is your responsibility.

### 10\. THIRD PARTY INFORMATION COLLECTION AND EXTERNAL SERVICES

10.1 Gwent may, from time to time, contain or connect you with third party content or services. Our Privacy Policy does not extend to external sites or companies, so please refer directly to their privacy policies.

10.2 Some services may involve interacting with our sister company GOG (remember them from earlier in this privacy policy? See section 7.2 above for more), or potentially other trusted partners of CD PROJEKT RED. For example, in order to play Gwent you will need to create a GOG account and, depending on your device, you may need to install and use GOG Galaxy. In order to do this, we may need to share some of your personal information with our trusted partner. The shared information would be protected by their Privacy Policy.

You may find third party links in Gwent or we might direct you to third parties. They may collect information from you   
under their own privacy policies. Make sure to take a look at them.

We provide some services via our sister company GOG (who helped us in developing Gwent)) – we will share some information with them.

11.1 Please be aware that we are subject to various laws and we may be required to release personal information to comply with law enforcement or other legal requirements.

11.2 In the unlikely event of a reorganisation or merger of CD PROJEKT RED we may transfer personal information to an involved third party who will protect this to at least the same level as we do in this Privacy Policy.

We might be required to comply with law enforcement requests to release personal information.

Regardless of any reorganisations, acquisitions, etc., your personal information will be protected the same way  
as it is right now. Fear not!

12.1 You have the right to ask us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes. You can change your email settings to unsubscribe from email communications.

12.2 Depending on where you live, you may have additional privacy rights. For example, in the EU you have the right to access your personal information we possess; you may have the legal right to contact us to request that we delete your personal information from our system; and you may have the legal right to ask us to rectify/correct your personal information if appropriate. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honour your request, but we may decline requests that are unreasonably repetitive, are disproportionate or infringe the privacy of others. Of course, you will be notified in advance.

12.3 Under California law, California residents who have an established business relationship with us have the right to request certain information with respect to the types of personal information we have shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, and the identities of those third parties, within the immediately preceding calendar year, subject to certain exceptions. All requests for such information must be in writing and sent to: 

CD Projekt S.A.  
ul. Jagiellońska 74   
03-301, Warsaw, Poland

This same California law permits us to provide you, in response to your written request, with a cost-free means to choose not to have your information shared rather than providing the above described information. You may exercise that choice by contacting us at the address above.

12.4 If you would like to exercise any of these rights or have any queries regarding them, contact: [legal@cdprojektred.com](mailto:legal@cdprojektred.com).

You have rights about how your personal information is used. Any questions, please contact us at [legal@cdprojektred.com](mailto:legal@cdprojektred.com).

### 13\. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

13.1 We may change this Privacy Policy if we think it's necessary, e.g. for legal reasons or to reflect changes in our services. If so, we will make the changed Privacy Policy available online and update the “Last Updated” date.

13.2 Once we change the Privacy Policy, it will become legally binding on you 30 days after we post it online. During that period, you're welcome to contact us if you have specific questions about the changes.

13.3 If you do not agree to those changes (regardless of whether you email us), then unfortunately we must ask you to cease using Gwent. We're sorry we have to say that, but we hope you'll appreciate that for our services to work properly we need to have everyone using it under the same rules instead of different people having different rules. That's why we encourage you to get in contact if you have queries.

We can change this Privacy Policy, but if we do, we will put the changed version online and normally it will take effect 30 days afterwards. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions with regards to the changes.

14.1 We'd also like to remind you that our Gwent User Agreement (once activated) will have more information about how we operate Gwent. 

Just a reminder about our Gwent User Agreement too.
