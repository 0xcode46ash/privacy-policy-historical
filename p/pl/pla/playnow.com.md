BCLC's Three Pillars of Privacy

As a public body, the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act ("FIPPA") applies to BCLC. FIPPA directs how BCLC can use your personal information. BCLC's commitment to privacy is based upon three pillarsâ€“fairness, accountability and accessibility. These three pillars are designed to help BCLC meet its obligations under FIPPA.

1\. Fairness

BCLC strives to use fair information practices. This means:

  * We provide you with clear and adequate notice when we collect your personal information (a "Privacy Notice") as required by the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act ("FIPPA"). Note that in some situations, e.g. law enforcement, FIPPA does not require the provision of a Privacy Notice.
  * In every Privacy Notice, we state the purposes for which we will use your information and we obtain your explicit or implicit consent to allow us to use your personal information in accordance with the stated purposes.
  * We take steps to minimize the collection of sensitive personal information.
  * If we use your personal information to make a decision that directly affects you we make every reasonable effort to ensure that your personal information is accurate and complete.
  * We will not send you advertising or marketing information without your consent.
  * We will not sell your personal information to third parties. In some cases, we share your personal information with other companies that provide services on our behalf. In those cases, we only provide them with the information needed to perform those services and we also require them not to share your information with anyone else.



2\. Accountability

BCLC is accountable for the ways in which we deal with your personal information. We do this by:

  * Developing and providing privacy training to all of our employees and key service providers so that each person who may handle your personal information understands how to protect that information.
  * Conducting regular reviews to make sure that our employees and key service providers have completed the training.
  * Using appropriate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the personal information we collect.
  * Having an established chain for reporting and responding to privacy issues.



3\. Accessibility

BCLC aims to be accessible. This means we will provide you with information about the existence, use and disclosure of your personal information, and provide you with access to that information upon request.

To review records containing your personal information you may be required to submit a formal request under FIPPA. You can do this by contacting BCLC's Information and Privacy department at 1-877-706-6789.

Registration

In order to use PlayNow.com, you must first complete the registration form and create a user account. During registration you are required to provide personal information (such as name, address, date of birth, phone number, email address and credit card information). We use this information to verify your identity (BC Resident over age 19) and register you for our Site. We also use this information to expedite enrollment in other services provided by BCLC or BCLC's service providers that BCLC thinks may be of interest to you.

Deposit of Funds

Once registered for an account, you will need to deposit funds to use our Site and services. You must provide financial information, such as credit card number and expiry date. We use this information solely for the purpose of processing a deposit into your account. If there is difficulty processing the deposit, you will receive notification on your screen and will be prompted to contact your card issuer or BCLC Customer Support.

Withdrawal of Funds

In the event that you wish to withdraw funds from your account, we will collect your bank account information (transit #, institution #, account #). This information is used to facilitate the transfer of funds from your PlayNow.com wallet into your bank account, and is only accessed upon your request.

Surveys or Contests

From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our Site. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to disclose any personal information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name, email address, and phone number), and demographic information (such as postal code and age group).

We use this information to track and target the interests of our users so that we can enhance the experience of users on our Site. In the case of contests, this information is used to contact the winners to award their prize.

We use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests and that company is prohibited from using our players' personal information for any other purpose.

Communications from the Site

**Communications**

Upon registration, you are given a choice to subscribe to receive communications about products, tips and promotions. You are able to change this subscription at any time under Edit Profile.

**Choice/Opt-out**

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by:

  * following the "unsubscribe" link included in each email communication
  * selecting "No" to contact under Edit Profile on your My Account page
  * calling PlayNow.com Customer Support at 1-877-706-6789
  * completing the [General Feedback Form](https://web.archive.org/about-playnow/contact/feedback.html) on PlayNow.com



**Special Offers and Updates**

We will occasionally send you information about our Site and services, however, at any time, you may elect not to receive these types of communications. Please see the "Choice and Opt-out" section for details.

Identity Verification

To determine if you qualify to participate on our Site, we use your name, address, date of birth and credit card information to verify that you meet our age (19+) and residency (B.C. residents only) requirements. A soft check against your credit file is performed as part of the verification process. This check will not affect your credit rating or credit score. Any personal information you provide will also be used to prove your identity if you contact BCLC Customer Support.

Information Sharing and Disclosure

**Aggregate Information (non-personal information)**

We share aggregated demographic information, such as age, gender and location, about our user base with third party companies that provide marketing services to BCLC. This information does not identify individual users and is only used for the purpose of selecting target audiences for marketing campaigns.

**Personal information**

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.

We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as credit card processors and email services providers. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

We may also disclose your personal information:

  * as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;
  * when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request; and
  * to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.



**Agents/Service Providers**

We use other third parties such as an email or text messaging service provider to send emails and SMS (text messages) on our behalf, and a credit card processing company to bill you for services. We will share your name, email address, and financial information as necessary for the third party to provide that service.

Information Used for Monitoring

We gather certain information automatically, such as, internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, operating system, date/time stamp, mobile device, make and model, mobile device network operator, and clickstream data (which is data that tracks playerÃ¢Â€Â™s movements on the site). This information is used to monitor activity on our systems for security purposes (e.g. fraud detection) and is also used for web analytics.

We link an IP address to every transaction using geolocation technology in order to ensure players are accessing their account from residences within BC. We also use IP addresses to assist in dispute resolution and for troubleshooting purposes.

Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer or mobile device for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personal information you submit while on our site.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser whereas a persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We utilize cookies to help manage player logins, to protect against security issues and to remember player preferences. We do not set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, as we do not want anyone to be able to access your account other than you. 

If you reject cookies, you will not be allowed access to our site. 

**Third Party Cookies**

The use of cookies by our tracking utility company and service providers is not covered by our Privacy Policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. 

Our site regularly uses Google Website Optimizer (GWO) to perform variation testing. GWO cookies are placed within site pages to determine page effectiveness in conversion. The results from this testing are used to create an improved product experience for our players. GWO does not collect personal information, only information related to the session. In the event that personal information is collected, Google requests your consent before sharing it. Further details can be found in the [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/privacy-policy.html).

Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)

We use a third party tracking utility company to employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons, Web Bugs, Tracking Tags), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personal information.

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see "Choice and Opt-out". 

Flash LSO's

We use local shared objects, also known as Flash Cookies, to store your preferences (such as volume control) or to display content based upon what you view on our site to personalize your visit. 

Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here: <http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118>.

Security

The security of your personal information is important to us.
