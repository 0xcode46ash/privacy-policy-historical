**PLAYSUSHI PRIVACY POLICY**

This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains what information Future Ads LLC (the "Company" or "we") collects from individuals who visit the PlaySushi.com website (the "Site" or "PlaySushi") and/or participate in the resources offered by PlaySushi ("User(s)" or "you"). This Policy also explains how the Company uses and maintains that information.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this Policy, the PlaySushi home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.   
We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on the PlaySushi home page. 

This Policy applies only to information collected on PlaySushi and not to information collected or obtained from other sources. 

We collect two kinds of information through the Site. The first kind is information that can identify you as a specific individual - such as your name and email address ("PII"). We only collect PII when you have contacted us directly or forwarded content from the Site to someone else. (See "Collection of Personally Identifiable Information" below). The second kind of information is the kind of non-personally identifiable information ("NPII") collected and stored automatically by many websites. It includes, for example, information about your Internet service provider, operating system, type of browser, geographic location, and pages viewed on PlaySushi. Although this information is related to you, it is not associated with your PII and cannot be linked to you personally. If you register to play "Premium Games", the NPII collected may also include your IP address and HTML information about the content of web pages you visit. 

If you do not want your information to continue to be collected and used as provided in this Policy, you should not access or use the Site again. 

Premium Game players ("Premium User(s)") have access to the Premium Games at no charge in exchange for their agreement to install the PlaySushi software (the "Software") on their computers or other computing device. The Software allows us to provide a Premium User with a limited amount of text link and transitional advertisements based on the web content viewed by that Premium User. No PII is collected through the Software. 

**Collection of Personally Identifiable Information**

PII is collected by PlaySushi only when you provide it to us by using one of the following Site features: 

  * When you communicate with us via the "Contact Us" page, PlaySushi asks for your name, phone number and email address so that you can receive a response. 
  * When you use our "Send Game to Friend" feature, PlaySushi collects the name and email address of you and your friend. We will only send your friend a onetime email inviting them to visit the site and check out the game that you sent them. We do not retain their PII for any purpose. 



We do not collect any PII when games are submitted.

**AdThis Widget**

If you choose to use our referral service to send a game to a friend using the AdThis Widget, AdThis will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We do not collect or store the information collected through the AdThis widget, please read their privacy policy regarding the collection and use of information. We also use the AdThis widget in order to allow you to share links to the Site on various third party web sites. Please note that you will be taken to these third party domains and asked to login to your account in order to share links about PlaySushi. PlaySushi does not have any access to this information. 

If you do not want us to collect your PII as described above or to use and share your PII as described further below in this Policy, you should NOT provide it to us through any of the PlaySushi features described above. By providing us with your PII using any of these features, you are authorizing our use and sharing of your PII as described in this Policy and any subsequent revisions to this Policy that we may publish on the Site. 

**Updating Your Personally Identifiable Information.**

If your PII changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend, or remove it by emailing our Customer Support at or by contacting us using our contact form at http://www.playsushi.com/Contact.ps. 

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at . We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. 

**Children's Privacy**

PlaySushi and the content available or emails delivered in connection with PlaySushi, are neither intended for, nor directed to, nor to be accessed by, persons under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect PII from anyone under 13 years of age. 

**Use and Sharing of Personally Identifiable Information**  


We reserve the right to use PII: (1) for the specific purpose for which such information was provided as stated above; (2) for the purposes disclosed at the time such information is provided; or (3) as disclosed in this Policy. We may also retain outside contractors to provide technical support or perform other services for us. We require that these contractors keep the PII of our Users confidential and that they use personal information only on behalf of Future Ads LLC. 

In addition, if we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your PII will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified by a prominent notice on the PlaySushi home page for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your PII. 

We also reserve the right to disclose PII as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process. 

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**  


As with many websites, when you visit PlaySushi, PlaySushi automatically gathers certain NPII based on your computer information and stores it in log files. This type of technical and statistical information is used to customize your experience at PlaySushi, to help us improve the quality of PlaySushi and to make your visits to PlaySushi easy, convenient and fun. PlaySushi also collects your IP address to help diagnose problems with the Site server and for Site administration purposes. 

In addition to the general collection of NPII by the Site, the Software downloaded by Premium Users tracks HTML on the web pages visited in order to deliver ads contextually. If at any time, a Premium User no longer wants the Software to collect NPII or to deliver customized advertising, s/he may deactivate the Software which will uninstall the Software and its associated monitoring technologies. The directions for uninstalling the Software are set forth below in the section entitled "Deactivate Software."

PlaySushi uses "cookies" and similar means to collect aggregate Internet traffic statistics and to enhance your experience at the Site. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. PlaySushi uses cookies to recognize your preferences, temporarily store session information (such as your login to a download or support area), and to remember you when you register for our products and/or services. This helps save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information and to display your customized content and advertising on your later visits to the Site. It also allows you to move from page to page at the Site without having to sign in again on each page. If you do not want PlaySushi to deploy cookies in your browser, you can set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when a website tries to put a cookie in your browser software. If you choose to decline cookies, however, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Site and it may affect your ability to use some of the products and/or services at the Site. We do not tie any PII to the cookies that we set.
