### What Information Does Plantronics Collect?

Plantronics will collect personal information from our users for different purposes. Information gathered online can be identified as either anonymous or identifiable. Anonymous information is information that cannot be traced back to the individual. Identifiable information is information that is specific to the individual so that we can deliver the right products and services to the individual. The following lists the many ways in which we collect personal information from our users and the type of information collected:

To purchase products and to obtain other services offered on the Websites, a user has to create his/her profile by completing a questionnaire online. Through the completion of the questionnaire by a user we collect the following information: (i) full name; (ii) address; (iii) e-mail address; (iv) credit card information; (v) password; and (vi) nickname. The provision of this personal information is mandatory and if you choose not to submit the requested information we will not be able to provide you with the services offered on the Websites.

To register your purchased product online, we request the following information: (i) full name; (ii) email address; and (iii) purchase date. The provision of this information is mandatory in order to register your purchase online. The provision of the remaining information requested on the product registration form is optional.

An applicant may consider submitting his/her resume online to join the Plantronics team. During this process we may collect personally identifiable information. You will be asked to create a login consisting of your email address and password. You will also be asked to identify your area of expertise and years of experience to complete the profile creation. Plantronics uses services provided by SuccessFactors in the online career search. Information provided may be shared or transferred to SuccessFactors. We encourage users who will use this system to review the [privacy policy](http://www.successfactors.com/en_us/company/privacy.html) of SuccessFactors. By virtue of the online resume submission we collect the following personal information: (i) first and last name; (ii) phone number; (iii) e-mail; (iv) employment area and years of experience; and (v) the text of the resume. The provision of this information is mandatory. If the resume is submitted for a specific position, the user may be required to answer specific questions in regards to their employment and educational background. In addition to mandatory information, we request information such as address, current employment, education, preferred location, activities and organizations and a brief description of your career objectives. The provision of this information is optional. SuccessFactors is not allowed to use the information collected for any purpose other than the original purpose.

To become a Plantronics authorized reseller, a user must complete an online application. By virtue of our online application we collect personal information such as the user's full name and e-mail address. The provision of this information is mandatory for users who want to become authorized resellers. In addition to this mandatory information, we request information such as current employment, phone and fax. The provision of this information is optional.

If you desire, you may participate in Plantronics' online surveys. If you choose to participate, we will collect anonymous information about the environment you work in, telephone habits, and demographic information. These surveys are developed in order for us to understand what types of products are most effective for our customers and to find the best ways to advertise to reach new customers. Your participation in our online surveys is entirely voluntary. Plantronics may provide gifts to those individuals who participate in surveys, and will request a mailing address to ship the gift. Plantronics will not use the mailing address or personal information for any purpose other than mailing the gift.

You will be given the option to opt-in to receive further emails from Plantronics, including but not limited to marketing emails, advertisements, newsletters and bulletins. Currently any information captured through support is not provided to anyone outside of Plantronics.

Plantronics may use mobile messaging, SMS campaigns to communicate with customers who have opted in to receive these types of communications. We will use a third party service to deliver the messages, they have been advised that any personal information transmitted to them in order to transmit the campaign is the property of Plantronics and not to be used for any other means other than to carry out the transaction.

### Does the Plantronics Website Use "Tracking Technologies?"

We, and our third party partners, use cookies, scripts, and tags on our Websites. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor's hard drive to help us improve your access to our Websites and identify repeat visitors to our Websites. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Websites. Additionally, we use cookies to track our online advertising efforts. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/) (or if you are located in the European Union, please click [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personal information on our Websites, though cookies may be used in the online career center to share personal information with SuccessFactors to accommodate the hiring process.

Our third party partners employ a software technology called clear GIFs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our Websites by informing us what content is effective. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear GIFs to our customers' personal information.

We use clear GIFs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see ["How Can I Opt-In/Opt-Out"](http://www.plantronics.com/us/privacy/#optOut)

We, and our third party partners, use Local Shared Objects (Flash cookies) or Local Storage (HTML 5), to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML 5. To manage Flash, please click here:<http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html>

### Mobile Applications

When you download and use our mobile apps, we automatically collect information on the type of Plantronics device you use, the operating system version of your smartphone or tablet, and the Plantronics device identifier (or "UUID").

We may ask you for location based information from your mobile device while using our mobile apps. We collect your location information for the purpose of enabling features in the Plantronics Hub for Android/iOS mobile app such as the BackTrack™ feature. This feature helps to identify the location of your headset’s most recent disconnect event for the purpose of tracking a lost headset.

We collect app usage information for the purpose of enhancing your user experience. We may record information such as how often you use the app, the events that occur within the app, aggregated usage and performance data. We use this information with analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personal information you submit within the mobile app.
