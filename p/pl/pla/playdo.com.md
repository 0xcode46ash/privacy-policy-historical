# Privacy Policy

**_Privacy Policy_** ****

You can trust us at Playdo. We swear solely that we will protect and keep your personal information private and never share it with other companies or other people without your permission. As long as you don't break any of the rules (described in the terms and conditions) and laws (local, national or international), your privacy is safe with Playdo; If you do however, we might have to share your information with Legal Authorities.

The information we collect about you helps us to serve you better and allows us to get in touch with you. 

You will be notified about how all information you give us will be used and if, or how, it'll be displayed in Playdo. Some information is public so people can communicate with you and the rest is private or set in different levels of privacy. 

NEVER share any personal information - in chat rooms, blogs, guest books or your profile - if you are not TOTALLY sure and aware of that you want to show it to the world. This is your very own responsibility, don’t take lightly on this. Playdo reserves the right to, but do not promise to, temporarily hide personal information posted by you while checking with you (or your parents if you are under 18) that it is really OK.

**E-mail:**

We may from time to time e-mail you with informative messages about services or third party products and services we believe you might be interested in. 

The newsletters may contain code that enables our database to track your usage of the newsletters, including if the email was opened and/or what links (if any) were clicked. We can combine that information with other information we have about you to improve your site experience and/or provide customized e-mail communications to you. 

**Password:**

Your password is the master key to your profile. So try to use a password that is hard to guess. And even though it might sound a bit obvious, we must remind you not to give it to anyone. We will NEVER ask you for your password so don't be fooled by e-mails that do so. 

**IP Address:**

An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a unique string of numbers, like a bar code or an ID, that your server and Internet Provider gives to your computer. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. IP addresses are used only to help us find and fix problems with our server and to administer the site and to contact you. Your IP address may also be used to gather broad demographic  information. But again, we will never share your IP address with anyone else. It's our little secret! 

**Cookies**

Cookies, donuts, cakes and other delicious desserts! YUMMY! Cookies in Playdo are sugar free. We may place this text file called “cookie” in the browser files of your computer. They are small lines of text that are stored in your browser to save information about you while you access Playdo. That helps us know how to serve you better improving your experience and providing customized communication. We may use this information to enhance your experience and we may share some information, but never your personal information, with our members, vendors, sponsors or others. 

As in a celebrity diet, you can avoid cookies. You only have to delete them from your browser directory and to stop allowing them completely change your browser preferences (go to Tools > Internet Preferences > Privacy).
