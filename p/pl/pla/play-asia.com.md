Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only in the events as described below:

> 5.2.  
> We cannot ensure that all of your communications with our Web site and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.
