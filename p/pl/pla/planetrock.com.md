> For the reasons set out in this Privacy Policy and for technical and operational reasons, your personal information may from time to time, on our behalf, be transferred, processed or stored on servers based outside of the EEA.  You should be aware that such countries outside of the EEA may not offer the same level of protection for your data.  For example, your data may be processed to allow personalised radio streaming, to process your entry into a competition, to fulfil any order you make for goods or services, to process any payment details or to provide support services.
