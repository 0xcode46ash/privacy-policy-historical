# Planet PDF - Privacy Policy - updated 26 October 2000

|    
**Privacy Policy for Planet PDF, Planet PDF Forum & PDF Store**  
**Date of last update: 26 October 2000**

This policy covers the following areas within the Planet PDF community site:   


  * Planet PDF <http://www.planetpdf.com/>
  * Planet PDF Forum [http://forum.planetpdf.com](http://forum.planetpdf.com/)
  * PDF Store <http://www.pdfstore.com/>



Planet PDF is part of the [BinaryThing.com](http://www.binarything.com/) business-to-business network of online communities.

As our user community--including visitors to our Web sites, discussion forum members, newsletter subscribers and customers--is our most valued asset, we will strictly adhere to the policy statement detailed below. Please take a few minutes to read the entire document so you understand when and why we request certain kinds of information, and what options you have for controlling your personal information.

****Our Pledge to You****

In short, we will make every effort to safeguard any information you may share with us through any of a variety of possible online exchanges and transactions. We will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you visit our sites unless you choose to provide such information to us.

We do not sell, rent, swap or otherwise disclose any personal information -- *except* in the specific case of sales or demo downloads of commercial software products. This exception is explained in Section D below.

**A. Requesting Your Personal Information**

While most information at the Planet PDF site is freely available, at times we request certain personal information from users wishing to take advantage of specific opportunities. Providing identifying information is optional in some cases, required in others (i.e. PDF Store purchases).

We request your personal information -- which may include such things as email address, name, address, telephone number, etc. \-- in exchange for certain activities, including:   


  * one-time Planet PDF Forum access registration (or use Read-Only guest access) 
  * Planet PDF Newsletter subscription 
  * PDF Store purchases 
  * product demo downloads 
  * Adobe Acrobat Reader downloads 
  * periodic surveys and/or contests 
  * PDF-on-the-fly postcard service 
  * other interactive components we may add to our sites 

  
In PDF Store, we require personal credit card information and an accurate email address in order to complete a commercial transaction. (More on purchases in Section D below.) 

**B. Use of "cookies"**

The Planet PDF sites make use of so-called "cookies," snippets of information that are transferred to the hard drives of users for various purposes. The use of cookies is an industry standard and occurs at most major websites. 

  * Planet PDF makes use of a "per-session cookie" (to monitor traffic patterns), which is deleted when the user leaves the site. This cookie in no way identifies the user; its sole purpose being to monitor traffic patterns. Users can disallow this cookie by configuring their Web browser's preferences. 
  * PDF Store makes use of a "persistent cookie" when users enter their details during the process of downloading a product. The purpose of this cookie is so a user does not need to enter their details when downloading another product. Users can disallow this cookie by configuring their Web browser's preferences. 
  * The Planet PDF Forum requires the use of a cookie to enable users to navigate between pages and participate in discussions. Choosing not to accept this cookie will mean the Forum will not function correctly. 



**C. Use of collected information**

Planet PDF uses the information it gathers for:   


  * developing enhancements to the Web site 
  * restricting anonymous, inappropriate use of the discussion forums 
  * delivering its free newsletter to subscribers 
  * internal marketing and promotional purposes 



In addition, we routinely track site traffic by analyzing our Web server logs, but nothing in that data reveals your personal identity. We use the log information (for example, length of session, pages viewed, etc.) to help determine overall traffic patterns, to determine user interests and to continue improving the site to better serve our user community.

From time to time, we may directly contact a user about a specific question, problem, comment or idea that he or she has posted -- we are always looking for user experiences to share with the rest of the community.

**D. Sharing sales data with PDF Store vendors**

As noted previously, Planet PDF does not sell, rent, swap or otherwise disclose any personal information to other companies or organizations with one exception: PDF Store product sales and demo downloads, with transactions conducted through RegNow.com. RegNow.com is required to adhere to this same policy as regards respecting the privacy of Planet PDF customers.

The PDF Store shares collected user information with its third-party vendor partners, but ONLY about demo downloads and sales [for registration, tech support, etc] of that specific company's products.

**E. Security**

Our sites utilize state-of-the-art security technology to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of such information. Nonetheless, we are not responsible for any breach of its security or for the actions of any third parties that may obtain any personal information.

**F. Removal from distribution lists, databases**

Planet PDF Forum registrants and Planet PDF Newsletter subscribers may remove their personal information from our distribution lists as follows:

  * For the Forum: Contact us via email at [editor@planetpdf.com](mailto:editor@planetpdf.com)
  * Planet PDF Newsletter recipients can cancel their free subscriptions at any time at <http://www.planetpdf.com/binthing~WebPageID,322.htm>
  * If you have a problem, please let us know at [editor@planetpdf.com](mailto:editor@planetpdf.com)



The only way to receive the newsletter is either by directly subscribing from the small form on the home page, or by indicating an interest while registering for downloads, participating in surveys, etc. Users who subscribe to the Planet PDF newsletters will continue to receive relevant newsletters by email at regularly timed intervals.

**G. Review and Correction**

After logging in to the Planet PDF Forum, registered members can at any time access their User Profiles to make changes. Registered participants also have the option to receive forum messages via email by selecting that option after logging in to the general forum area.

**H. Changes to this policy**

Planet PDF reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time by notifying users (through posting an "Update" notice on this Web page and possibly others, and an announcement in the newsletter) of the existence of a new Privacy Policy or any updates. Any significant change in the use of personal information would not be retroactive to include information gathered under a previous policy.
