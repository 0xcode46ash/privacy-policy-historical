# Privacy Policy

At www.planetcalc.com, we recognize that your personal privacy is important. Here we detail what kind of personal information we collect when you visit www.planetcalc.com, and how we safeguard your privacy.

## Personal information

We collect and store information you enter in the site registration form, such as your name, email and password. Also you may enter your website URL and a short description of yourself in the personal profile.

We may send you email comments, notifications or information letters regarding news about our site.

## Log Files

As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information contained in log files includes your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site, and which pages you visited.

We create visitor statistics reports based on information obtained from the log files. The statistics reports consist of aggregate information that does not contain any personal visitor data. These reports may be presented to third parties, for example to advertisers willing to place ads on our site.

## Cookies and Web Beacons

We use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences, when you visit our site. This could include only showing you a site interface in a selected language, for example, or allowing you to log in to some of our features, such as forums or private site areas.

We also use third-party advertisements on www.planetcalc.com to support our site. Some adverts may use technology, such as cookies and web beacons, which will send advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information, including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site and, in some cases, whether you have Flash installed.

This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as cookery adverts to someone who frequently searches for online recipes). A cookie uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security number, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt out of this advertising technology on this website, as well as others, by visiting http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.

You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site, as well as other websites. This could include the inability to log in to services or programs, such as forums or accounts.

Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have disallowed cookies in your settings, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.
