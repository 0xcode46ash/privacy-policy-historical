Irrespective of which country you reside in or supply information from, you authorize Placeit to use your information in the United States and any other country where Placeit operates.

**Information Collection and Use**

**Information Collected Upon Registration:** When you create or reconfigure a Placeit account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, and email address.  If you create your Placeit account by connecting through another service, we may use public information from that connected account to help complete your Placeit profile. You may update or modify your profile information and contact information at any time.

**Use of Information and Content:** We utilize your information for internal business purposes and to communicate with you, including marketing services offered by Placeit and our business partners.  You may use your account settings to unsubscribe from notifications from Placeit. Other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell your content or information or share it with any third party.  Furthermore, your information and content is not listed publicly or encouraged by Search Engines to crawl.  Your content is not attributed to you on a public URL unless you directly share such content publicly.  All content that you upload is stored on servers selected by Placeit; such content is not deleted but is kept by or for Placeit.  Your content can be publicly seen if a third party has access to your exact URL (it is not private).  If you wish to have your content deleted, please email us at [hi@Placeit.co](https://mail.google.com/a/freshout.us/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=hi@recordit.co), and in most cases we will delete your content within five (5) business days after we receive your request.

**Cookies:** We may use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer’s hard disk to help improve your user experience. Placeit may use cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users, and web traffic routing on our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.

**Log Data:** Our servers automatically record information (“Log Data”) created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, or interact with our email notifications. Placeit uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them.

**Third-Parties:** Placeit uses third-party services to help provide our Services and help us understand the use of our Services. These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address. Third-party ad partners may share information with us, like a browser cookie ID or cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address), to help us measure ad quality and tailor ads. For example, this allows us to display ads about things you may have already shown interest in. If you prefer, you can turn off tailored ads in your privacy settings so that your account is not matched to information shared by ad partners for tailoring ads.

**Payments** :  All payments related to the Services are processed by Apple or its payment service providers.  Placeit is not responsible for any matter relating to such payments, or any information that you provide relating to any such payments.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

**Your Consent:** We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your Placeit account.

**Service Providers:** We may engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States and abroad. We may share your private personal information with such service providers subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.

**Law and Harm:** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Placeit’s rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information.

**Business Transfers:** In the event that Placeit is involved in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The covenants, terms and conditions in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.

**  Non-Private or Non-Personal Information:** We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public user profile information.

**Modifying Your Personal Information**

If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access or modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account.

You can also permanently delete your Placeit account. If you follow the instructions in account settings, your account will be deactivated and then deleted. When your account is deactivated, it is not viewable on the Placeit application.

**Policy Towards Children**

Our Services are not directed to persons under 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child’s account.  Children under 13 years old are not allowed to create an account without a parent’s or guardian’s express consent. We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.  If you are under 13 years of age, your use of the Services is a confirmation that your legal parent or guardian has expressly consented to your use of the Services and provision of information and content as described herein.

**Governing Law**

The laws of the United States and California govern this Privacy Policy and your use of the Services, whether you reside in California or elsewhere (including outside of the United States).  Placeit attempts to strictly comply with this Privacy Policy and will promptly seek to correct any non-compliance after written notice, but shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to this Privacy Policy.

**Changes to this Policy**

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time and at any time. The most current version of the Privacy Policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at http://help.Placeit.co/privacy. If we make a change to this Privacy Policy that, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you via the email address associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.

**Sharing**  
We may share your information with our advertisers and other partners, or with a governmental entity if required (by law, regulation, court order, warrant), or simply upon request.

**Google Analytics Features**  
This site has implemented Google Analytics for Display Advertising, in order to advertise online (which we do) via its “Remarketing” feature. Third-party vendors, including Google, may show our ads on sites across the Internet. We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone’s past visits to our website.
