PlacidWay provides information regarding medical tourism. Much of our information is published on our website, however, we do also offer our "Request for Information" service.  When you complete our online Request for Information form, the information that you provide helps us provide detailed information regarding the location of clinics in the nations you are interested in that possess health care providers who are able to provide the treatment you seek.  We will share this information with the clinics and healthcare providers so that we can provide you with clinic and healthcare contact names and phone numbers and so that you can conduct your own research to determine if the clinics and healthcare professionals meet your expectations. 

At your request, in order to facilitate a review of your medical records by the clinic or healthcare profession of your choice, we will forward your medical records either electronically or by fax.  After receiving your medical records and reviewing the same, the clinic or health care provider you have selected will be able to better advise you regarding your medical treatment options, related costs, post-surgery recovery time and the amount of time in total you will need to stay in the nation where the clinic is located. 

We do not share your medical information, name, email address or any other personally identifiable information with any third parties except as we have explained in the above paragraph. 

Should you use our “forward to friend” service, we may store related file details in our database.  We may send emails to those parties so that we can encourage them to sign up for our services. We also will store information regarding such “friend” emails so that we can determine which of our members are more successful regarding recruiting new members to our web site in case we wish to reward or provide some sort of positive feedback to such members.
