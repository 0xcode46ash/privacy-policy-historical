We encourage you to read the privacy statement of any website you may visit.

|  **"OPT-IN" EMAILS** Users may "opt-in" to receive site notifications, newsletters, or other information via email. Users may remove themselves from such services at their discretion. Any email sent to an "opt-in" list will include directions for how a user may remove himself or herself from the list, or a URL where the user may find such directions.
