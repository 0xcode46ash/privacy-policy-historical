# PRIVACY POLICY

                                      PRIVACY POLICY
THIS PRIVACY POLICY PROVIDES THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES OF PLANGRID,
INC., A DELAWARE CORPORATION, 454 SHOTWELL STREET, SAN FRANCISCO,
CALIFORNIA, 94110 (“PLANGRID”) FOR COLLECTING, USING, AND DISCLOSING
USER INFORMATION. USERS CAN ACCESS PLANGRID’S SERVICE (THE “SERVICE”)
THROUGH PLANGRID’S “PLANGRID” MOBILE APPLICATION AND THE
ASSOCIATED WEBSITE (THE “SITE”), AS MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN THE LICENSE
AND TERMS OF SERVICE (THE “AGREEMENT”). THIS PRIVACY POLICY IS
INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE AND IS SUBJECT TO THE AGREEMENT. IN THE
EVENT OF ANY CONFLICT BETWEEN THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THE
AGREEMENT, THE AGREEMENT WILL PREVAIL. CAPITALIZED TERMS NOT
OTHERWISE DEFINED HEREIN SHALL HAVE THE MEANING GIVEN THEM IN THE
AGREEMENT.
        1.      INFORMATION COLLECTION AND STORAGE
                a.     Information You Provide. When you register an account, PlanGrid
collects some personal information, such as your name, phone number, credit card or other
billing information, email address and home and business postal addresses (“Personal
Information”). You may also import your contacts by giving PlanGrid access to your third party
services (for example, your email account) or social networking information if you give PlanGrid
access to your account on social network connection services. You may also provide PlanGrid
with your contacts’ email addresses when sharing Content with them.
                b.     Content. PlanGrid collects, converts and stores the Content you upload,
download, or access in connection with the Service. If you add Content to your account that has
been previously uploaded by you or another user, PlanGrid may associate all or a portion of the
previous Content with your account rather than storing a duplicate.
                c.     Log Data. When you use the Service, PlanGrid automatically records
data, Content, and information (collectively, “Information”) from your desktop, laptop, mobile
phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device (each, an “Electronic Device”), its software,
and your activity using the Service. This may include the Electronic Device’s Internet Protocol
(“IP”) address, browser type, the web page visited before you came to the PlanGrid Site or
Application, information you search for on the Site or Application, locale preferences,
identification numbers associated with your Electronic Devices, your mobile carrier, date and
time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration information, metadata concerning
your Information, and other interactions with the Service.
                d.     Cookies. PlanGrid also uses “cookies” to collect Information and improve
the Service. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your Electronic Device. PlanGrid
may use “persistent cookies” to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to
the Service. PlanGrid may use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Service, to
better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and web


traffic routing on the Service. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop
accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you
do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of the Service.
         2.     PERSONAL INFORMATION USAGE
                a.      Personal Information. In the course of using the Service, PlanGrid may
collect Personal Information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personal Information is
or may be used: (i) to provide and improve the Service, (ii) to administer your use of the Service,
(iii) to better understand your needs and interests, (iv) to personalize and improve your
experience, and (v) to provide or offer software updates and product announcements. If you no
longer wish to receive communications from PlanGrid, please follow the “unsubscribe”
instructions provided in any of those communications, or update your account settings
information.
                b.      Geo-Location Information. Some Devices allow Applications to access
real-time location-based information (for example, GPS). The Application does not collect such
information as of the date this policy went into effect, but may do so in the future with your
consent to improve the Service. Some photos you place on the Site or the Application may
contain recorded location information. PlanGrid may use this information to optimize your
experience. Also, some of the Information collected from a Device, for example IP address, can
sometimes be used to approximate a Device’s location.
                c.      Analytics. Some Information may also be collected (by PlanGrid or by a
third party service) using logging and cookies, which can sometimes be correlated with Personal
Information. PlanGrid uses this information for the above purposes and to monitor and analyze
use of the Service, for the Service’s technical administration, to increase Service functionality
and user-friendliness, and to verify users have the authorization needed for the Service to process
their requests. As of the date this policy went into effect, PlanGrid uses Gaug.es. To learn more
about the privacy policy of Gaug.es, click [here].
         3.     INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE
                a.      Your Use. Your Personal Information will be displayed in your profile
page and elsewhere on the Service according to the preferences you set in your account. Any
Information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want others to know about you.
Please consider carefully what Information you disclose in your profile page and your desired
level of anonymity. You can review and revise your profile information at any time. PlanGrid
may also share or disclose your Information with your consent, for example if you use a third
party application to access your account (see below). Through certain features of the Service,
you may also have the ability to make some of your Information public. Public Information may
be broadly and quickly disseminated.
                b.      Service Providers, Business Partners and Others. PlanGrid may use
certain trusted third party companies and individuals to help provide, analyze, and improve the
Service (including but not limited to data storage, maintenance services, database management,


web analytics, payment processing, and improvement of the Service’s features). These third
parties may have access to your Information only for purposes of performing these tasks on
PlanGrid’s behalf and under obligations similar to those in this Privacy Policy. As of the date
this policy went into effect, PlanGrid uses Amazon’s, Heroku’s and MongoHQ’s storage services
to store some of your Information.
                c.      Third-Party Applications. PlanGrid may share your Information with a
third party application with your consent, for example when you choose to access the Service
through such an application. PlanGrid is not responsible for what those parties do with your
Information, so you should make sure you trust the application and that it has a privacy policy
acceptable to you.
                d.      Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Requests; Protection of
PlanGrid’s Rights. PlanGrid may disclose to outside parties Content stored in your account or on
the Site or Application and Information collected about you when PlanGrid has a good faith
belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with a law, regulation or compulsory
legal request; (b) protect the safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent
fraud or abuse of the Service or its users; or (d) to protect PlanGrid’s property rights. If PlanGrid
provides your Content to a law enforcement agency as set forth above, PlanGrid will remove
encryption from the Content before providing them to law enforcement. However, PlanGrid will
not be able to decrypt any Content that you encrypted prior to storing them on the Site or in the
Application.
                e.      Business Transfers. If PlanGrid is involved in a merger, acquisition, or
sale of all or a portion of its assets, your Information may be transferred as part of that
transaction, but PlanGrid will notify you (for example, via email and/or a prominent notice on
the Site and the Application) of any change in control or use of your Personal Information or
Content, or if either become subject to a different Privacy Policy. PlanGrid will also notify you
of choices you may have regarding the Information.
                f.      Non-private or Non-Personal Information. PlanGrid may disclose your
non-private, aggregated, or otherwise non-personal information, such as usage statistics of the
Service.
        4.      CHANGING OR DELETING YOUR INFORMATION. If you are a
registered user, you may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information provided in
your registration or account profile by changing your “account settings.” If your personally
identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire the Service, you may update or delete
it by making the change on your account settings. In some cases PlanGrid may retain copies of
your Information if required by law.
        5.      DATA RETENTION. PlanGrid will retain your Information for as long as your
account is active or as needed to provide the Service. If you wish to cancel your account or
request that your Information no longer be used to provide you the Service, you may delete your
account with PlanGrid. PlanGrid may retain and use your Information as necessary to comply
with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Consistent with these


requirements, PlanGrid will try to delete your Information quickly upon request. Please note,
however, that there might be latency in deleting Information from the servers and backed-up
versions might exist after deletion. In addition, PlanGrid does not delete from the servers files
that you have in common with other users.
        6.     PLANGRID USERS. The Service allows you to make some Content accessible
to the public or to other users. You should be aware that any Information you make available to
other users may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. Your Information may
remain even after you cancel your account.
        7.     SECURITY. The security of your Information is important to PlanGrid. [When
you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on order forms, PlanGrid encrypts
the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL)]. PlanGrid
follows generally accepted standards to protect the Information submitted to the Site or the
Application, both during transmission and once it is received. No method of electronic
transmission or storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, PlanGrid cannot guarantee its
absolute security.
        8.     POLICY TOWARD CHILDREN. The Service is not directed to persons under
13. PlanGrid does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under
13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided PlanGrid with
Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact PlanGrid at
[support@plangrid.com]. If PlanGrid becomes aware that a child under 13 has provided
Personal Information, PlanGrid will take steps to delete such information from the files.
        9.     CONTACT. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact
PlanGrid at [support@plangrid.com].
        10.    CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY. This Privacy Policy may change from
time to time. If this Privacy Policy is changed in a way that PlanGrid believes materially reduces
your rights, PlanGrid will provide you with notice (for example, by email). And PlanGrid may
provide notice of changes in other circumstances as well. By continuing to use the Service after
those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
