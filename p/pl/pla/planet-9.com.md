This Privacy Policy covers planet-9.com’s treatment of personally identifiable information collected from members (hereafter “members” or “you”) who use the planet-9.com website services, as well as consumer information that we acquire in the course of our business. This Policy also covers the treatment of personally identifiable information that planet-9.com’s business partners may share with it.

This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that planet-9.com does not own or control, or to people that planet-9.com does not employ or manage.

**Information Collection and Use**

When you register with planet-9.com, we ask for your contact information (such as your name, street address and email address), as well as certain information pertaining to your car if you own the model represented on this site.

In the course of processing a payment transaction, we typically receive from the merchant or a financial institution information related to the transaction. This normally includes information about the payment that a consumer has furnished the merchant or financial institution in placing the order. We do not acquire any information directly from consumers through the [www.planet-9.com](http://www.authorize.net/) Web site.

The personally identifiable information we acquire in processing payment transactions varies according to the nature of the transaction and the way in which merchants or financial institutions are using our payment services. It may include, for example, the amount of the transaction, the consumer’s name, credit card number and expiration date, checking account number, billing address, and shipping address.

planet-9.com uses the information collected to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to process payment transactions, to facilitate billing, and otherwise deliver the payment gateway services. We may also send merchants service announcements, newsletters, and periodic notices about specials, new products and services and products and services offered by planet-9.com business partners. Personally identifiable consumer information is used to process payment transactions and for no other purpose.

In the event that planet-9.com is acquired, merchant account information may be one of the transferred assets. 

**Information Security**

Information security is critical to our business. We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We store information gathered on secure computers located in a locked data center. The number of employees involved in the management of the data center that have physical access to these computers is limited. We use firewalls and other security technology to prevent our computers from being accessed by unauthorized persons.

We also require that any personally identifiable consumer information sent to us by you be encrypted using SSL encryption. To learn more about SSL, go to: [ http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/S/SSL.html](http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/S/SSL.html).
