# Plan3D - Privacy Policy For Online Subscriptions

**The Information We Collect**  
At this site, you can order products, subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected includes: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about some hardware on your computer.

We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows '95 or Mac OS), the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink) and some hardware settings (e.g., the type of 3D video card, CPU speed, amount of memory and so on).

**How We Use the Information**  
We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you - although we will never give your information to other people or companies outside plan3D without your explicit permission.

We may use this information to communicate with you, when we make changes to our subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us.

We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services from time to time.

Employees and contractors of Plan3D who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Plan3D.

Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking the site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data.

Plan3D may on occasion combine information we receive online with outside records to enhance our ability to market to you those products or services that may be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive marketing information from this site, click here for instructions on how to make your request.

Finally, Plan3D sites will not use or transfer personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt out of these unrelated uses.

**Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors**  
Plan3D sometimes may offer contests, sweepstakes, or promotions that are sponsored by or co-sponsored with identified third parties. By virtue of their sponsorship, these third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion. Plan3D has no control over the third-party sponsors' use of this information. Plan3D will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if third-party sponsors will obtain such information.

**Cookies**  
To enhance your experience at Plan3D, many of our web pages use "cookies." Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at one of our sites. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.

We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages (e.g. to recognize you by name when you return to our site), save your password in password-protected areas. We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services.

**Our Commitment to Security**  
We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online. For example, we do not keep your credit card information on our servers.

**How You Can Access or Correct Information**  
For instructions on how you can access the personally identifiable information that Plan3D has collected about you online, or how to correct factual errors in such information, please contact us.

To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
