Personal Information Collected Via Technology 

To make our services more useful to you, we use technological means to collect Personal Information from you, including the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) you just came from, the URL you go to next, your browser type, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. We may also use cookies or clear GIFs to collect Personal Information from you about your use of our site or e-mails we send you. In addition, we may use digital rights management technologies to collect Personal Information from you in order to activate a game. You expressly consent to our use of cookies, clear GIFs, and digital rights management when you use our services. 

An “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer Internet access provider, your IP address probably varies from session to session. We track IP addresses solely in conjunction with session cookies to analyze our Web page flow. 

“Cookies” are small pieces of information that a Web site sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a Web site. PlayFirst may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your Web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our site. 

“Clear GIFs” are clear electronic images that are used to track your movements on our site. PlayFirst may use clear GIFs to collect clickstream data, which will help us to improve our site and the services we provide to you. 

“Digital Rights Management” is a technology employed by PlayFirst to control the access and use of its games. Digital rights management enables PlayFirst to collect a user’s user name, password, and game key so that PlayFirst may activate or disable access to its games. Digital rights management also allows PlayFirst to track the time and date that you unlock your game. 

Personal Information We Collect from You About Others 

If you decide to invite a friend or family member to visit PlayFirst’s website, we will collect your friend’s or family member’s e-mail address in order to send this e-mail. We will not send additional e-mails to your friends or family, unless you specifically request us to do so.

Use of Personal Information

In general, Personal Information you provide to us is used to respond to requests that you make and to provide services to you. For example, we may use your Personal Information to process an employment application, should you submit one to us. We also use your personal information to process your payment for PlayFirst games and to send you electronic newsletters and promotional e-mails if you have requested to receive such communications from us (as described below). We also use Personal Information to provide you with updates to our services and to respond to your requests. 

We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you. We use this Anonymous Information to perform statistical analyses of users’ aggregate age and gender so that we may enhance the content of our services. PlayFirst reserves the right to use and disclose Anonymous Information to third parties in its discretion. 

Disclosure of Personal Information

We do not generally sell, trade, rent, or share your Personal Information with third parties. However, we will share your Personal Information with third parties to charge your credit card (if authorized by you), fill your order for games, and deliver promotional e-mails. These third parties are required not to use your Personal Information other than to provide the services requested by PlayFirst. You expressly consent to the sharing of your Personal Information with our contractors and third party service providers for the sole purpose of providing services to you. 

If you opt-in to receive communications from us (as described below), we will periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote the use of our site or the purchase of our games.

If you decide to post your highest score from any one of our games, you may post your screen name along with your score, unless you wish to remain anonymous. If you send a review of one of our games to us, we may post it on our site. We may attribute your review to you by posting your first name next to your review. 

Although we currently do not have a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, “affiliates”), we may in the future. We may share some or all of your Personal Information with these affiliates, in which case we will require our affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. If our company or our assets are acquired by another company, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. 

We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on PlayFirst; or (b) protect and defend the rights or property of PlayFirst or users of our website.

Links to Other Sites 

Our provision of a link to any other website or location is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its contents. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for, these outside websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of our Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside websites. 

Security 

We use reasonable measures to maintain the security of your Personal Information. PlayFirst enables the use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology and Verisign Site ID when you create a PlayFirst Account or purchase a game from us. 

PlayFirst has implemented other industry-standard electronic means of protecting your Personal Information. We store Personal Information behind a computer firewall, a barrier designed to prevent outsiders from accessing our servers. We also require you to enter a password to access your account information. In addition, PlayFirst protects your Personal Information from unauthorized physical access by storing your Personal Information in a controlled facility. Except as provided elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, PlayFirst limits access to Personal Information in electronic databases to those persons (including employees and contractors) in PlayFirst’s organization who have a business need for such access. 

Even though PlayFirst has taken significant steps to ensure that your Personal Data is not intercepted, accessed, used, or disclosed by unauthorized persons, you should know that PlayFirst cannot eliminate security risks associated with Personal Data.
