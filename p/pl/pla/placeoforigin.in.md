Placeoforigin is committed to deliver your order with good quality packaging within given time frame.

To ensure that your order reaches you in good condition, in the shortest span of time, we ship through reputed courier agencies only and to the specific geographies serviced by them. . We ship throughout the week during normal working hours except Saturday/Sunday/Public holidays (which are excluded to prevent the lag in shipments).

We levy a service charge for each order. The service charge is inclusive of the shipping charge for every order. For multiple products ordered, the program adds up the total of all individual shipping charges. Thus, a customer who orders three products is charged the total of all individual delivery charges associated with each product. Thus the delivery fee is calculated separately when a customer orders different products.

Orders placed before 1300pm are dispatched the same working day or the next working day depending on availability of the fresh product. Most orders are delivered within 2 to 5 working days. Delivery of all orders will be duly done to the address as mentioned by you at the time of placing the order. In order to avoid disappointment, we will not accept orders that need to be delivered to any pincode not serviced by our reputed courier partners.

If you think, you have received the package in a bad condition or if the packaging is tampered with or damaged before delivery, please refuse to accept the package and return the package to the delivery person. Also, please call our customer care at [mail@placeoforigin.in](mailto:mail@placeoforigin.in) or email us at [mail@placeoforigin.in](mailto:mail@placeoforigin.in) mentioning your Order ID.

Please make sure that you send digital evidence of the unsatisfactory product while raising a claim for a replacement/refund.

Please note that the delivery timing depends on a number of factors like: weather, unforeseen events, traffic conditions and other special events. However, we will always endeavour to complete the delivery as early as possible and keep you updated in case of any changes. We are not responsible for any delay caused by any unforeseen time lags by the courier companies in delivering the parcels to the customer, or if the customer is not available at the time of delivery.
