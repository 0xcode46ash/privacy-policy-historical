# PLATT ELECTRIC SUPPLY, INC. WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY

                                PLATT ELECTRIC SUPPLY, INC.
                                  WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY
General Policy. This policy describes the information that Platt Electric Supply, Inc., an Oregon
corporation ("Platt," "we" or "us") collects about visitors to this website (the "Website"), how we
use that information and how we protect that information. It also discusses certain choices you
have regarding your personally identifiable information. By using this Website, you consent to
the following terms, as they may be amended from time to time.
Information We Collect. You may visit this Website anonymously. We collect your Internet
Protocol address, but this information generally does not reveal your identity. The data that we
regularly collect about visitors to this Website (e.g., browser type, pages accessed, duration of
visit, etc.) does not enable us to identify you. We use "cookies," small files that are sent to your
browser and stored on your hard drive, to identify you as a unique user on this Website. Our use
of cookies is explained in more detail below. We collect personally identifiable information
about you only if you voluntarily provide it to us by requesting information, products, or services
from us.
Information You Provide. When you visit this Website, you may provide personally
identifiable information in order to purchase products or take advantage of services or job
opportunities offered through this Website. For example, you might provide your name, address,
telephone and fax numbers, and email address. We collect and store that information. You may
always choose not to provide the information we request. However, you may then be unable to
take advantage of the features and services we offer on this Website.
Information from Other Sources. From time to time we may purchase or otherwise acquire
information about you from other sources and add it to our database, including without limitation
updated delivery and address information.
How We Use Information. If you choose to provide us with personally identifiable
information, we will use that information to respond to your inquiry or process your order. We
may provide this information to third parties if we believe in our discretion it would be helpful in
responding to you, or if this information is necessary for the third party to do their job (see
"Third Party Service Providers," below). If, in the future, we merge with or are acquired by
another company, or change our structure, we may transfer your personally identifiable
information to the surviving or acquiring entity. We will also disclose your personally
identifiable information if we in good-faith believe we are required to do so (a) by law or to
comply with the law or legal process; (b) to protect and defend our rights or property or the
rights or property of our clients; or (c) in an emergency to protect the personal safety of our
employees, clients, visitors or the public.
No Sale of Personally identifiable information. Platt will not sell your personally identifiable
information to others except in connection with the sale of Platt or the assets of Platt.
Third Party Service Providers. Platt may from time to time engage others ("Third Party
Providers") to provide services to Platt, to you and to other visitors to this Website. For


example, Platt may engage other companies to host, operate and maintain this Website, analyze
data, provide marketing assistance, perform inventories or assessments and provide other
services. Platt will give them access to your personally identifiable information to the extent
necessary to do their jobs. Platt cannot guaranty that those companies will protect your
personally identifiable information to the same extent described in this Privacy Policy.
Links to Other Websites. When you visit this Website, you could be directed to Websites of
Third Party Providers and to other websites that are beyond our control ("Third Party Websites").
There are many links to Third Party Websites from this Website that may take you outside our
service. Platt believes that this is one of the strengths of this Website. For example, if you
"click" on a product link or if you click on a Third Party Provider link, the "click" may take you
from this Website to the website of that other person. If you choose to visit a Third Party
Website, you should understand that the third party's privacy policy, and not this Privacy Policy,
will govern your activities and any information you disclose while visiting that Third Party
Website. Third Party Websites may not have privacy policies or may have privacy policies that
are not as protective of your personally identifiable information as Platt's Privacy Policy. Third
Party Websites may collect data, solicit personally identifiable information, or send cookies to
visitors. Platt strongly recommends that you review and understand the privacy policies of the
Third Party Websites you visit, whether you visit Third Party Websites directly or through a link
from a page on this Website.
Email. From time to time, Platt may send email messages to some or all of its registered users
or customers. Platt may use a bulk email service to distribute that information. If you do not want
to receive such emails, please indicate that preference by contacting us at decline@platt.com.
Online Live Chat. This Website offers you the opportunity to chat online with a support
representative. In order to use this service, you will provide us with, at a minimum, your name
and email address. While Platt won't disclose to third parties the information you provide in an
online live chat, we cannot guarantee the security or privacy of this information.
Cookies. Upon your first visit to this Website, our Website may automatically send a "cookie"
to your computer. A cookie is a file that identifies you as a unique user. It stores personal
preferences and user data. Cookies do not identify you by name. Platt uses cookies to store
preferences and user data. You may have your browser disable cookies; however, some Platt
services provided by this Website may not function properly if you disable cookies.
Security. Platt uses encryption software in this Website to safeguard certain of your personally
identifiable information while that information is transmitted over the Internet, including
information you provide upon ordering or purchasing products from this Website. While using
this Website, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and
password, and for restricting access to your computer.
Policy Changes. Platt reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. We will post
any revisions to this Privacy Policy on this Website. Please review this page periodically for
changes. Your continued use of this Website will be subject to our then-current Privacy Policy.


Policy Regarding Children. This Website is for people 18 years of age and older. If you are
under 18 years of age, please do not submit any information to Platt without the consent of a
parent or guardian. Platt does not intentionally collect any information about children.
Disputes Regarding Use of Personally identifiable information. All disputes regarding Platt's
use of your personally identifiable information and/or the terms of this Privacy Policy will be
heard by any state or federal court located in the State of Oregon, USA, as more specifically
provided in Platt's Terms and Conditions of Use.
Miscellaneous. Platt's policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the
Internet, and therefore beyond Platt's control. Platt uses reasonable precautions to keep your
personally identifiable information secure. However, Platt is not responsible for any breach of
security or for the actions of any third parties. If you at any time have questions about this
Privacy Policy, please send your question via email to privacy@platt.com.
