## • Plaxo is committed to protecting your privacy and the privacy of individuals in your contact list ("Your Contact List"). Plaxo does not use or disclose any of Your Information (defined in the paragraph below) without your permission.

### Here's how it works

When you download Plaxo Contacts™ and join Plaxo Contact Networks™ you provide us with "Your Account Information," "Your Plaxo Cards" and "Your Contact List," each as described in detail below (together, "Your Information"). You can then elect to have Plaxo update and maintain Your Contact List. 

  1. **Your Account Information** : your name and your email address are _required_ by Plaxo in order to provide you with the Plaxo Contacts™ product and the Plaxo Contact Networks™ service (and other possible Services to which you decide to subscribe). Plaxo will also ask you to provide a private password and a challenge question and answer, which will become part of Your Account Information.


  2. **Your Plaxo Cards** : when you join Plaxo Contact Networks™, you can create Your Plaxo Cards to store contact information about yourself (e.g., your name, your email address, your phone number, your address). You may then choose to share Your Plaxo Cards with the individuals on Your Contact List and/or others on the Plaxo Contact Networks™ as you see fit. 


  3. **Your Contact List** : when you join Plaxo Contact Networks™ you also have the option to store a copy of Your Contact List on Plaxo's secure servers, rather than just on your computer. Your Contact List will not be shared with anyone and will only be used to provide you with secure, web-based access to its data and to run the Plaxo Contact Networks™ (e.g., send update messages) at your request.



### Your Information is your own and you decide who will have access to it.

Specifically:

  1. **Your Account Information** : this information is stored on Plaxo's secure servers and is not shared with any outside parties. If you [forget your password](http://support.plaxo.com/bin/answer.py?answer=54), you will be asked to go to the Plaxo Web site and create a new one. No plain text passwords will ever be passed through email.


  2. **Your Plaxo Cards** : you specify the information that is contained in Your Plaxo Cards and determine whether they are public or private. The Plaxo Cards which you mark as private are not accessible by anyone without your specific permission. The Plaxo Cards which you mark as public are accessible by those Plaxo members ("Members") who list you in their own "Contact Lists" and/or who know your email address. In the download and install process, Plaxo's default is to keep your personal card private and make your business card public. You must uncheck the "public" box on your business card template in order to keep it private.


  3. **Your Contact List** : you can elect not to store your entire contact list on Plaxo's servers, except to the extent needed to run the Services you choose to use (names and email addresses). 



### We do not sell, exchange or give Your Information to any third-parties.

We use Your Information:

  * To enable you to use the Plaxo Contact Networks™; 
  * For license reporting and assessment of service levels; and/or 
  * To better understand on an aggregated basis how our products are used, gauge traffic patterns and determine what types of content and services are most popular with users of our products and services. 



Additionally, we use Your Account Information:

  * To verify access rights to content, services or software; 
  * To provide you with information about Plaxo products, services, news and events through the Software, the Site or email; 
  * To allow you to purchase and download Plaxo products and services; and/or
  * To provide you with personalized content programming, instructions and services.



## • How we use Cookies and Log Files.

In order to improve the Services and the Site, we use "cookies" when you are logged into the Site using your email address and password. A cookie is a piece of data that is transferred to your browser by a Web server and can only be understood by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your computer's identification token and enables Plaxo to personalize your experience when you are signed in to the Services. The cookie also contains your email address so that we can make it easier for you to sign in. If you reject the cookie, you may not be able to sign up for some of the Services or use certain features of the Site.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. (For some Web pages that require an authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept cookies will probably not be able to access those pages.)

While Plaxo uses cookies to enable you to use the Services and the Site, and our Web servers automatically log the Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your computer, Plaxo does not use this information to identify you personally except to provide you with the features of the Services.

Like most Internet services, we use log files, both on the client and server side. The data held in log files includes your IP address, browser type, email application, Internet service provider ("ISP"), referring/exit Web pages, computer platform type, date/time stamp, and user activity. Plaxo uses the log data to analyze trends, administer the Services and the Site, and gather broad usage information for aggregate use. IP addresses are tied to neither Your Information nor any other Personally Identifiable Information. 

The Software has associated log and temporary files that are stored on your local hard drive and on Plaxo's servers. These files store Your Account Information, your permissions, preference settings and system notifications as well as other data necessary to operate the Plaxo Contact Networks™. Your Information resides locally in the email application you designate to work with the Services and the Software, as well as in Plaxo's servers, except if you have chosen not to store Your Contact List on Plaxo's servers for web access. Note that even if you have chosen not to store your Contact List on Plaxo's servers, this information will need to be temporarily copied to these servers whenever you choose to send update email requests to people in your Contact List (i.e., this information is necessary to send the update request). As soon as the email request has been processed, this information is deleted from these servers.

## • We will provide you with Member communications as you permit.

We send all new Members confirmation emails verifying the ownership of the email addresses provided in Your Account Information. We also communicate with you to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to your account.

Members may occasionally receive information on Plaxo products, services, news and events. Out of respect for your privacy, we present you with the option to not receive these communications (link to your account Preferences on the web site).

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service-related announcement which is not promotional in nature. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send you such a notification. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, though you can deactivate your account.

## • Limited Data Sharing with Third Parties.

We may share aggregated and anonymous demographic information with our business partners but no such information can be linked directly to Your Account Information, Your Plaxo Cards, Your Contact List or other personally identifiable information.

Though we make reasonable efforts to preserve your privacy (and that of your contacts), we may need to disclose personally identifiable information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on Plaxo and/or the Site.

In the event Plaxo goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition or the sale of a portion of its assets, Your Information and your membership in the Plaxo Contact Networks™ will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. You will be notified of an ownership change pursuant to Notification of Changes section of the privacy statement.

## • Links.

The Site contains, and the Software may present, links to other sites. Please be aware that Plaxo is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Site or otherwise link to other sites, to read the privacy policies of each and every site that collects personally identifiable information. Plaxo's Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by the Services, the Software or the Site. 

## • Plaxo is Committed to Protecting Your Privacy.

When you submit Your Information via the Software or the Site, Your Information is protected in several ways. The Services use Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") for all client-server communication using Your Information. Your Web-based access to Your Information is protected by an encrypted password. We recommend that you do not disclose the password to anyone. Additionally, Your Information resides on a firewall-protected server that only selected Plaxo personnel have access to via password. Plaxo strives to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing Your Information.

## • Children's Privacy.

Plaxo is committed to protecting the privacy needs of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests. Plaxo's Services, Software and Site are not intended for and may not be used by children under the age of 13. Plaxo does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 and Plaxo does not target its Services, Software and Site to children under 13.

## • Personal Information of Others.

Your Information may include contact and other personal information in Your Contact List for individuals who have not joined Plaxo Contact Networks™ or who are otherwise not Plaxo users. Plaxo is committed to protecting the privacy rights of these individuals. We will not sell, exchange or give information in Your Contact List regarding such individuals to any third-parties. We may receive requests from such individuals to remove their personal information from Your Contact List. In such event, we may encourage them to contact you directly or we may relay such request to you on behalf of such individuals. We will not alter or remove any information regarding such individuals from Your Contact List without your consent.

## • Correcting/Updating/Deleting Information.

You have the right to access and correct, update, and/or delete Your Information at any time. You can do so by using the Software on your desktop or by signing into your account on the Site.

## **•** Notification of Changes.

If we decide to change the Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on the Site's homepage, and other places we deem appropriate, so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances -- if any -- we disclose it. We will use Your Information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected. 

If, however, we plan to use Your Information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use Your Information in this different manner. However, if you have declined member communications, deleted or deactivated your account with the Services, then you will not be contacted, nor will Your Information be used in this new manner.

In addition, if we make any material changes to our privacy practices that do not affect Your Information already stored on Plaxo's servers, we will post a prominent notice on the Site notifying you of the change. In some cases where we post such a notice we will also contact you, if you have opted to receive member communications from us, notifying you of the changes to our privacy practices.
