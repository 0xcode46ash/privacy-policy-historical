### INFORMATION COLLECTION

Plated, and any third parties acting under Plated’s authorization, will not collect any personal information about you except when specifically and knowingly provided by you. Examples of such information are name, shipping and billing addresses, phone number, email address, credit card information and customer preferences data. Examples of ways in which we may collect such information from you include the following:

#### A. Personally Identifying Information

 **Registration and Ordering.** Before using certain parts of this Site, registering to enter one of the Promotions and/or ordering products, you must complete a registration form. When registering, you will be prompted to provide certain personal information, depending on the applicable registration form, including, but not limited to, your name, shipping and billing addresses, phone number, email address and credit card number (including security code and expiration date). In addition, you may also be asked to provide your country of residence and/or your organization's country of operation, so we can comply with applicable laws and regulations, and for your gender. These kinds of personal information are used for billing purposes, to fulfill your orders, to verify entry into a Promotion, to ship any prizes won in connection with the applicable Promotion, to communicate with you about your order and this Site, and for internal data modeling and marketing purposes. If we encounter a problem when processing your order, we will use the personal information to contact you.

 **Email Addresses.** Some areas of the Site allow you to enter your email address for purposes including, but not limited to: registering for a particular service or activity, registering to enter a Promotion or opening a Plated account. If you choose not to provide your email address when prompted, you may not be able to engage in some or all of those activities.

 **Information from Social Media.** If you access or log-in to a Plated service through a social media website or other non-Plated service, or connect a Plated service to a social media website or other non-Plated service, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service. When you access the Plated services through social media services or when you connect a Plated service to social media services, you are authorizing Plated to collect, store, and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

 **Retargeting/Remarketing.** Plated may work with third parties to allow such third parties to show Plated’s ads on sites other than Plated.com, and to permit third parties to use cookies to serve ads to you based on your past visits to the Plated.com website.

### PROTECTING YOUR INFORMATION

Shopping on the Site is easy, secure and worry-free. We have taken several measures to guarantee that your order and your credit card information are safe and secure. Our servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an advanced encryption technology.

SSL is considered the industry standard and is among the leading software available to encrypt online transactions. Your personal information including your name, credit card number and address is encrypted so that it cannot be read as it is transmitted over the Internet. Regardless of these efforts, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, any information you transmit to us is sent at your own risk.

To further protect yourself, you should safeguard your Plated account username and password and not share that information with anyone. You should also sign off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit to our sites. Please note that we will never ask for your Plated account username or password via email.

### NON-US INFORMATION

You agree that your information will be held by Plated in the United States and may also be held and accessed by Plated staff and third parties working for Plated inside and outside the United States. If your information is gathered outside the United States, you agree that it may be transferred to Plated’s United States offices to be used for these purposes, and it may be transferred to and shared with any of Plated’s worldwide locations.

### CHILDREN’S PRIVACY

We do not intentionally collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. If we become aware that we have collected personally identifiable information from a user of the Site who is under the age of thirteen, we will remove that child’s personal information from our files.

### OPT OUT POLICY AND PROCEDURES

### OFFLINE COLLECTION, USE & DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION

The majority of information that we collect is obtained through our Site, and this Privacy Policy applies only to that online collection of personal information, as well as the collection of personal information at one of our food trucks. We also collect information offline, where we also try to protect the privacy of your personal information. One example involves someone calling us to place an order or to ask questions. When someone calls, we will ask only for the personal information we need in order to place the order or to answer the question. When we need to store information (such as order information), we will enter it into our database through SSL encryption. (See the Protecting Your Information section above for more information).

We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time without notice to you. We encourage you to refer to this Privacy Policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Site or Services available through the Site constitute your: (a) acknowledgement of the modified Privacy Policy; and (b) your agreement to abide and be bound by the Privacy Policy.
