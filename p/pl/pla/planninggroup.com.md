**Planning Group International, Inc. Privacy Promise for Consumers**

While providing real-time online performance metrics is the cornerstone of our business, our most important asset is our customers' trust.

Here then, is our promise to our individual customers:

  4. We will not reveal customer information to any external organization unless we have previously informed the customer in disclosures or agreements, have been authorized by the customer, or are required by law. 
  5. We will always maintain control over the confidentiality of our customer information.
  6. We will tell customers in plain language initially, and at least once annually, how they may remove their names from marketing lists. At any time, customers can contact us to remove their names from such lists. 
  7. Whenever we hire other organizations to provide support services, we will require them to conform to our privacy standards and to allow us to audit them for compliance. 
  8. We will continuously assess ourselves to ensure that customer privacy is respected. We will conduct our business in a manner that fulfills our Promise in the many nations in which we do business.
