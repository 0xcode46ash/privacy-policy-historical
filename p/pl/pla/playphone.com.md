Last Updated August 1st, 2012

We know how important your privacy is to you, so we have designed the PlayPhone Social Service to protect information about you from unauthorized disclosure to others. This Privacy Policy details how we collect, use, and in certain circumstances, share your personally identifying information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully and if you have any questions, feel free to contact us. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the PlayPhone Terms of Service. By using the PlayPhone Social Service, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. Please note that we may modify the Privacy Policy from time to time. It is your responsibility to ensure that you regularly review our Terms, as continued usage of the Site and the Service indicates acceptance of such modifications.

We collect and record the information you have provided. Other than names and email addresses provided at your discretion, we don't generally collect any personally identifying information about our users (such as credit card information, street address, etc.), with the exception of any credit card or other information provided by you for billing and payment purposes. We may offer you the opportunity to submit other information about yourself (such as gender, age, occupation, hobbies, interests, zip code, etc.) or you may provide information through Games or Applications. Such information shall also be covered by this Privacy Policy. Any actions you perform or information you provide that can be seen by other users of the Site, the Service, or any Games or Applications is considered public and should be performed and provided at your own risk and discretion.

When you use a social network service ("SNS") in connection with your use of the Service, we may record information regarding the use of that SNS and we may collect other information that is visible on the SNS in accordance with the relevant terms of use associated with the provider of the SNS.

Note that since some PlayPhone software is served through a SNS, it is your responsibility to read and accept the terms and privacy policy of such SNS prior to continuing.

When you invite new members into your network or send messages through the Service, we collect and maintain on secure servers the information associated with those messages, including email addresses and content.

The Site may contain links to other websites. We are of course not responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Site to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by PlayPhone on the Site, the Service, or in any Game or Application.

You should also be aware that most content delivered through the Service originates with another content provider. Such other content providers may place "cookies" on your browser, or otherwise gather information about you, including by asking you to provide information through the Site.

Finally, in order to provide the best possible service and to allow us to make certain internal reports and make recommendations, we collect aggregate information about the use of the Service, including information about users accessing the Service or playing Games or Applications, such as internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages and URLs, other browser history, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time ("Activity Information").

By using the Service, you consent to our retaining all the above-described information in anonymous form as long as PlayPhone sees fit.

PlayPhone does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for PlayPhone or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to PlayPhone. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under the age of 13, please contact us at help@playphone.com. We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.

We do not sell or rent your "personally identifiable information" to any third party. We may, however, use certain information about you that is not personally identifiable.

We use public information collected to determine the kinds of content that you would like to view and to assist any advertisers in targeting their advertising.

We also use your name, email address and other information on our system to notify you of new product releases, service notifications, and to solicit your feedback and input. Those emails will contain links for preference management and where appropriate, unsubscribe links should you decide you do not want to receive further emails.

You understand and agree that we may access, preserve, and disclose any information we may have about you and the contents of your account if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to avoid liability, to comply with legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, to protect our rights and property, or that of our affiliates or the public, or enforce this Privacy Policy or the Terms. PlayPhone is not required to question or contest the validity of any search warrant, subpoena or other similar governmental request that PlayPhone receives.

We also may use non-personally identifiable information and certain technical information about your phone, computer and your access of the Service (including your phone number and internet protocol address) in order to operate, maintain and manage the Service.

PlayPhone may disclose information about you to its partners in order to provide the Service, resolve maintenance problems and correct errors in the Service, to communicate with you about the Service, to provide you with advertising and promotional information in connection with the Service, and to enhance your experience on the Service. However, we do not give our partners an independent right to share this information.

Due to our contractual obligations with these third parties and the need to share information to deliver and support the Service, we cannot provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of sharing information (whether personally identifiable information or other information) with these third parties.

PlayPhone, certain of its partners, and each of their contractors and employees may view the User Content that you transmit to the Service to provide the Service and otherwise perform the tasks set forth in this Privacy Policy.

You may decide to provide us with another person's email address so that person may be invited to join the Service or so that we may facilitate your communication with other people through the Service (such as when you upload an address book).

You may also provide us with another person's contact information for purposes of delivering information through a SNS. We use this information to contact and, if necessary, remind that person that he or she has been invited to join the Service or has received content through a SNS. All invitees are provided with the option not to receive further invitations from PlayPhone. We may disclose such information if required to do so in order to comply with legal process, as set forth above.

PlayPhone follows generally accepted industry security standards to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security and correctly use your personal information. However, no commercial method of information transfer over the Internet or electronic data storage is known to be 100% secure. As a result, PlayPhone cannot guarantee the absolute security of that information during its transmission or its storage in PlayPhoneâ€™s systems. Be advised that if you send messages or post material containing personal information, that information may be collected and used by others.

Upon termination of your account, PlayPhone will remove your profile and other personal information from view. PlayPhone, however, may (but is not obligated to) keep information about you that is on its system following your termination. Please contact PlayPhone if you have any questions about your personal information.

We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer of ownership of PlayPhone or the acquisition of substantially all the assets of PlayPhone related to the business which collected such information, such as acquisition by or merger with another company. In such an event, PlayPhone will notify users who have provided email addresses when information about those users is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

A cookie is a small text file recorded on your hard drive that identifies you as a unique user and contains certain information about your particular login session and/or your use of the Service. The Service may send cookies to your computer when you access the Site, or otherwise view content through the Service or a Game or Application. The Service uses cookies to improve quality, make recommendations, and make the Service easier to use for you.

PlayPhone may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our site and in certain Games and Applications. Our advertisers may use third-party advertising technology to target advertising on the Site and other sites. In the course of advertisements being served to you, a unique third-party cookie or cookies may be placed on your computer. Similarly, third-party advertising companies may provide us with pixel tags to help manage and optimize our online advertising. Pixel tags enable us to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits the site on which the beacon is located, and to learn which banner ads bring users to a given site.

PlayPhone does not provide any personally identifiable information to third-party advertising companies.

Under California law, California Residents who have an established business relationship with PlayPhone or one of its subsidiaries may choose to opt out of PlayPhoneâ€™s disclosure of personal information about them to third parties for direct marketing purposes. As detailed above, our policy is not to disclose personal information collected online to a third party for direct marketing purposes without your approval. If you want to withdraw consent to our use or storage of your personal information, please send an e-mail to help@playphone.com
