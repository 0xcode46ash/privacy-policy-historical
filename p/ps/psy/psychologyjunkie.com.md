# Privacy Policy - Psychology Junkie

Your privacy is very important to us. At Psychology Junkie we have a few fundamental principles that we follow:

  * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
  * We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  * We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of our site.



It is Psychology Junkie’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

**Website Visitors**

Like most website operators, Psychology Junkie collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Psychology Junkie’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Psychology Junkie’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Psychology Junkie may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Psychology Junkie also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our blogs. Psychology Junkie only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.

**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**

Certain visitors to Psychology Junkie’s websites choose to interact with Psychology Junkie in ways that require the site to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Psychology Junkie gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who comment on our blog to provide a username and email address. Those who wish to receive Psychology Junkie updates via email, we collect their emails. In each case, Psychology Junkie collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Psychology Junkie. Psychology Junkie does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

**Aggregated Statistics**

Psychology Junkie may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Psychology Junkie may monitor the most popular pages or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam. Psychology Junkie may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Psychology Junkie does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

**Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information**

Psychology Junkie discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Psychology Junkie’s behalf or to provide services available at Psychology Junkie’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Psychology Junkie will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Psychology Junkie discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Psychology Junkie believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Psychology Junkie, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Psychology Junkie website and have supplied your email address, Psychology Junkie may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Psychology Junkie and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Psychology Junkie takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Psychology Junkie uses cookies to help identify and track visitors, their usage of Psychology Junkie website, and their website access preferences. Psychology Junkie visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Psychology Junkie’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Psychology Junkie’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

**Business Transfers**

If Psychology Junkie, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Psychology Junkie goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Psychology Junkie may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

**Ads**

Ads appearing on psychologyjunkie.com may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Psychology Junkie and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

**Comments**

Comments and other content submitted to Akismet anti-spam service are not saved on our servers unless they were marked as false positives, in which case we store them long enough to use them to improve the service to avoid future false positives.

**Privacy Policy Changes**

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Psychology Junkie may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Psychology Junkie’s sole discretion. Psychology Junkie encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.

## Disclosure

In 2015, the **_[Federal Trade Commission released their new rules for Disclosure Compliance](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/ftcs-endorsement-guides-what-people-are-asking)_**[. ](http://www.business.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/bus41-dot-com-disclosures-information-about-online-advertising.pdf)These rules are set in place to ensure that readers or viewers of web media (blogs, Youtube videos, etc.) know if the blogger/presenter is sponsored, endorsed, or partnered with a different company. In blog terms, the readers need to know if the blogger is making money by sharing a link or product.

**In compliance with the FTC guidelines, please assume the following about links and posts on this site:  Any/all of the links on PsychologyJunkie.com are affiliate links from which I receive a small compensation from sales of certain items.**

__**What are affiliate links?**__  
Purchases are made on external affiliate company websites: When a reader clicks on an affiliate link located on Psychologyjunkie.com to purchase an item, the reader buys the item from the seller directly (not from Psychology Junkie).  Amazon and/or other companies pay Psychology Junkie a small commission or other compensation for promoting their website or products through their affiliate program.

**Prices are exactly the same for you if your purchase is through an affiliate link or a non-affiliate link. ​You will  not pay more by clicking through to the link. **

I use two main types of affiliate programs:

**1. _Amazon affiliate links._  **  
Psychology Junkie is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon properties including, but not limited to, amazon.com, endless.com, myhabit.com, smallparts.com, or amazonwireless.com.  Amazon offers a small commission on products sold through their affiliate links. Each of your purchases via our Amazon affiliation links supports our cause at _no additional cost to you_.

Amazon and the Amazon logo are trademarks of Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates.  
​  
If a blogger links to an Amazon product (with a special code for affiliates embedded in the link), and a reader places an item in their “shopping cart” through that link within 24 hours of clicking the link, the blogger gets a small percentage of the sale.  Amazon links are not “pay per click.”  If you click on the product link and stay around Amazon and purchase something else, however, I will get commission on that sale.

Anytime you see a link that looks like www.amazon.com/….  
​it may be an Amazon affiliate link.

**2.   _Product affiliate links._  **  
These affiliate links work the same way: if you click the link and buy the product, then the blogger gets a percentage of the sale or some other type of compensation. Again, prices are not different if you use these affiliate links. You will _not_ pay more by clicking through to the link. These links are not “pay per click.”
