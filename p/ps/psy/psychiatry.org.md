# Privacy Policy | psychiatry.org

 Last Updated: 3/9/12

The American Psychiatric Association (APA) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it at all times. This online privacy statement explains how the APA collects, uses and safeguards information on its Web site(s). This Internet Privacy Statement applies only to information collected by the APA through its Web site(s).

**Changes to the Internet Privacy Statement  
**  
As our organization, membership and benefits change from time to time, this Internet Privacy Statement is expected to change as well. We reserve the right to amend the Internet Privacy Statement at any time, for any reason. We will post a notice that this Internet Privacy Statement has been amended by revising the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.

If you have questions about this Internet Privacy Statement, please send us an e-mail. Please note that we cannot process opt-out requests sent to this e-mail address. 

**What information we collect and how we use it**

**Information we collect** \-- When you browse [www.psychiatry.org](http://www.psychiatry.org/) and do not interact with the site(s) for any online service or product from the APA, you browse anonymously. Personally identifiable information--such as your name, address, phone number and e-mail address--is not collected as you browse.

When you become a registered user on our site(s), or choose to interact with our site(s) in other ways, such as subscribing to APA publications, purchasing an APA product, applying for APA membership, participating in online surveys, submitting questions or comments or requesting information or materials, we will collect certain personal information from you. The type of personal information collected will vary but may include name, address, phone number, birth date, billing and delivery information, e-mail address, credit card information and other demographic information. We do not collect Social Security numbers via an APA Web site(s). The type of product or service that you seek will determine the personal information that is collected. For a listing of the exact type of personal information that will be collected from you, please refer to the appropriate online form.

**Tracking activity on our Web site(s)** We track how our site(s) is used by both anonymous visitors and visitors who interact with the site(s). One way we track is by using "cookies." A cookie is a small file or string of text on the site(s) user's computer that is used to aid Web navigation. Two types of cookies are commonly used. A session cookie is created by a Web site(s) when that Web site(s) is accessed; that type of cookie is automatically deleted by closing the Web browser. A persistent cookie is a cookie that is stored on the hard drive of the user’s computer for a period of time chosen by the Web site(s) that set the cookie, usually for a number of years, unless the user deletes it manually. This policy distinguishes between short-lived cookies and long-lasting cookies. Short-lived cookies include all session cookies and those persistent cookies that are set to be stored for no more than one week. APA-related Web site(s)s may at times require users to accept short-lived cookies in order for the Web site(s)s to function properly. Long-lasting cookies may be used on the site(s) to track visitor practices to help determine which site(s) features and services are most important and guide editorial direction. Other long-lasting cookies may make it possible for the user to access the site(s) without requiring entry of a user name or password, allow the user to view different restricted areas of the site(s) without reregistering, allow the user to personalize the site(s) for future use and provide other features and benefits.

Users who do not desire the functionality created by the long-lasting cookie should have the option to disable the long-lasting cookie function, by disabling the long-lasting cookie function on their Web browser. 

**How we use personal information** \-- Once collected, we may use your personal information (except for email address, which is outlined below) for the following purposes:

  * Register you for programs and services you have requested
  * Process, fulfill and follow up on your orders or membership application
  * Answer your e-mails or on-line requests
  * Send information you request
  * Send and process surveys
  * Ensure the APA site(s) is relevant to your needs
  * Deliver APA services such as newsletters, meetings or events



Notify you about new products/services special offers, upgrades and other related information from the APA and other approved third parties

**How we use your e-mail address** \--The following defines how e-mail will be handled for physicians and medical students, APA members and nonphysicians who have supplied their e-mail address to the APA.

**Physicians:** All physicians who have provided an e-mail address and opted in are sent the daily Headlines publication.

**Physicians, medical students, and nonphysicians:** The APA may also send "transactional or relational e-mail messages" to physicians, medical students, and nonphysicians with whom we already have a relationship.

We do not share, sell, trade, exchange or rent your e-mail address to vendors for them to market their products or services to you. When we hire vendors to deliver e-mails to you on our behalf, they are under agreement and limited from using your e-mail address for any other purpose.

When we send e-mail to you, we may be able to identify information about your e-mail address, such as whether you can view graphic-rich HTML e-mail. If your e-mail address is HTML-enabled, we may choose to send you graphic-rich HTML e-mail messages.

These e-mail messages may contain "clear GIFs" or "Web beacons" to measure the offer’s effectiveness so we know how to serve you better. We do not collect personally identifiable information through "clear GIFs" or "Web beacons."

**Continuing Medical Education:** The APA will share information regarding your participation in the APA’s online CME systems including your name, email address, courses taken, credits received and other CME related data with the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology for the purposes of improving the ability of both organizations to track and consolidate board certification data.

**How to opt out of e-mail** \-- To opt out of an e-mail list, go to our APA e-newsletter opt in/out page or click the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any e-mail newsletter from the APA. You can also call the APA Answer Center at 703-907-7300.

The APA may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process served on the APA; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of APA; or (c) protect the personal safety of APA personnel or members of the public in urgent circumstances.

**Banner advertisements on our Web site(s)** \-- Online advertisements on the APA’s Web site(s) do not collect any personally identifiable information on individual visitors. The APA does collect nonmedical aggregate data on visitors such as time of day and Web browser type. Such information may be shared with advertisers to determine their advertising effectiveness.

**Children under 13** \-- We do not knowingly solicit data online from or market online to children under the age of 13.

**Information security** \-- The APA implements security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. We restrict access to personal information to the APA’s business partners who may need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

**How we safeguard information  
**  
**Site(s) security features  
**SSL technology and how you benefit from it -- APA realizes the importance of security, so we've taken a number of steps to enhance the protection of information sent to or from APA over the Internet. First, we require that a "secure session" be established, using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. This is done any time you supply or access information in one of our secure online areas.

SSL technology creates a private conversation that only your computer and APA systems can understand. The SSL technology encodes information as it is being sent over the Internet between your computer and APA systems, helping to ensure that the transmitted information remains confidential.

**User ID and password** \-- Many areas of the site(s) require the use of a user ID and password as an additional security measure that helps protect your information. This allows APA to verify who you are, thereby allowing you access to your account information and preventing unauthorized access.

When you have finished using a secure area of APA’s Web site(s), make sure you always click on the "Log Out" link which appears on every secure page. When you click on the "Log Out" link, you will be given the option to end your secure session. No further secure transactions can be conducted without re-entering your user ID and password. You should be aware that browser software often "caches" a page as you look at it, meaning that some pages are saved in your computer's temporary memory. Therefore, you may find that clicking on your "Back" button shows you a saved version of a previously viewed page. Caching in no way affects the security of your confidential user ID or password.

**No guarantee** \-- Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, and despite our efforts, APA cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, or to or from our online products or services.

**Linking to other Internet site(s)  
**You should be aware that other Internet sites that link to the APA site(s) or to an APA e-mail may contain privacy provisions that differ from the provisions of this Internet Privacy Statement. To ensure your privacy is protected, we recommend that you review the privacy statements of other Internet sites you visit.

**How you can access and change information  
**If you are a registered user of the APA Web site(s), subscriber to APA publications, purchaser of APA products or an APA member, you may review and update/correct your information by using your user name and password or by contacting the APA Answer Center at (703) 907-7300.

Physicians may update or correct any information the APA may have on file by going online or may call (703) 907-7300. Updates or corrections to certain types of information (e.g. physician licensure, medical education or training, etc.) will require independent verification prior to effectuating any (permanent) change to our files.

**Changes to the Internet privacy statement  
**The APA regularly reviews its compliance with this Internet Privacy Statement. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Internet Privacy Statement or APA’s treatment of personal information by sending us an e-mail. Changes to our Internet Privacy Statement will be noted below so that you can be fully informed about the privacy protections we provide and your choices with regard to our use of personal information.
