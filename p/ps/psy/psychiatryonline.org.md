**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If your subscription includes online access to DSM-IV-TR and other textbooks and journals via PsychiatryOnline.com, please review the Privacy Policy available in the footer of pages at [](http://www.psychiatryonline.com/)[http://www.PsychiatryOnline.com](http://www.psychiatryonline.com/).

American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. (APPI), publisher of PsychiatryOnline Journals, takes your privacy concerns very seriously. We are committed to protecting your personal information at all times.

We appreciate that you provide us with your personal data. By sharing this information with us, you allow us to make the process of purchasing and managing your subscription more convenient, reliable, and seamless.

Except for the purposes indicated in this Privacy Policy, we will NOT disclose, share, sell, or rent your e-mail address or credit card number to any third party.

**What Personal Information Do We Collect? **

We collect personal information such as your name, address, demographics, and credit card information, which allows our systems to recognize you and complete your transactions. Some of this information is necessary to successfully complete a transaction; other, nonessential information is voluntary. Below you’ll find details about the personal information we collect from you, and a brief description of how that information is used.

**TRANSACTION INFORMATION**  
When you subscribe to a journal from APPI, it is necessary for us to obtain information from you (such as your name, contact information, and credit card data) to complete your transaction and manage your subscription. This information is stored with each transaction and shared with appropriate third parties facilitating the transaction (for example, credit card authorization companies). We provide only the information necessary to ensure your order is completed. We use technology that encrypts your information (name, address, credit card number, etc.) before it is transferred across the Internet from your computer to our secure server. This ensures that your personal information is protected at all times.

**CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION (CME) REPORTING**  
Personal information, including the name of the individual user, is private to CME faculty and the American Psychiatric Association. We collect registration information, CME scores, and credits awarded and information volunteered by the user such as demographics and course evaluation responses to facilitate the peer-review analysis of our content and to understand the utilization of our programs. The resulting information is used only in the aggregate and only for internal program decisions. Registration records for participants in CME activities are maintained for 6 years to fulfill Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) requirements. Only aggregate numbers are provided to ACCME. This information is not shared with any other organizations for commercial purposes.

**USAGE TRACKING**  
Our servers collect software client information, such as IP addresses, browser versions, operating systems, and pages accessed during user sessions. This information is used ONLY in aggregated form (e.g., number of pages accessed) to view site usage patterns and to provide institutional usage reports.

**COOKIES**  
Cookies are small bits of data that we send to your computer for later retrieval by our application. We use them to keep track of the fact that you have signed in so that you don’t have to continually enter your username and password as you move around the site. We do not use cookies to track what other sites you have visited, or to look at or track any personal or confidential information about you. We make use of cookies to enable authorization control for online subscriptions. We delete all of our cookies when you click “Sign Out.”

**Alerts, Promotions & Newsletters **

All PsychiatryOnline Journal alert e-mail lists are “opt in,” meaning that users proactively register to receive such communications from us. All e-mail alerts offer clear instructions for opting out of future e-mail communications. Learn more about available alerts [here](http://journals.psychiatryonline.org/misc/PDA_services.dtl).

APPI sometimes shares subscriber information (but never your e-mail address or credit card number) with selected outside companies whose products or services we feel may be of interest to you.
