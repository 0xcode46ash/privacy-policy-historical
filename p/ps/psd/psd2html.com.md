All data passing from your computer to this web site is authenticated and encrypted using 256-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption using technologies provided by Verisign. This is the most advanced level of encryption available today, and it means that any information sent from your computer is scrambled in a way which makes it completely unintelligible if intercepted.
