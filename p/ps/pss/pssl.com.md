**International Shipping Fees, Import Duties and Taxes:** All International shipments will be charged postage costs calculated by weight and destination. **PSSL.com’s prices do not include customs fees, taxes and tariffs.** Customers outside of the United States may be subject to customs fees and/or import duties and taxes, which are levied once a shipment reaches your country.

Huge Inventory & On-Line Stock Status

Something we’re quite proud of! Our multi-million dollar inventory ensures that most of PSSL.com’s orders ship out the same day they are placed. Get the gear you need NOW! No waiting, no hassles. 

At PSSL.com you'll know the stock status of item before you order. No surprises, no excuses - what you see is what you get. Items that are in stock clearly state "In Stock", items that are out of stock show the anticipated day your order will ship if you place your order today. Our inventory is accurate and we won’t tell you something is in-stock when it isn’t. Any order placed on the weekends will be shipped on the next business day. Business days are Monday through Friday. 

Backorders

We regularly stock every item we carry. Although every attempt is made to maintain inventory of each product, occasionally a product may be on back order. If any product is not in stock for an order, we will hold the shipment of your entire order until all products are available. In the event your order contains an item that is not in stock, your order will show the approximate ship date based on when we expect the item to reach our warehouse. If you would like the in stock portion of your order to ship now, you can: 

  * Place separate orders: Place one order for the items that are in stock and another for the items that are on back order.
  * Contact us by email or phone and let us know that you would like the backorder items to ship separately and to release the in stock items. There will likely be additional shipping and handling fees. 



Order Status and Tracking

Providing the items you ordered are in stock, you will receive a shipping confirmation email within 24 hours of placing your order. This email will provide you with the shipping confirmation numbers necessary to track your order. 

If you did not provide us with an email address, please keep your Order Confirmation number readily available from time of purchase. Our Customer Care Center will be able to track your package for you.  
Just [email](http://www.pssl.com/email) or call 800-268-5520.

In designing our website, we started with the simple belief that customer service is our number one priority. Therefore the customer information we collect is used to enhance our services to you, our customer. 

**When you visit our website, we collect non-personal information about your visit.** We collect your IP address, browser type, domain name, and we log the length of time of your visit and the number of times you visit and purchase from us. We assign you a unique internal identifier to help keep track of your future visits. We use this information to gather aggregate demographic information about our visitors, and we use it to personalize the information you see on our website and the emails you receive from us (should you grant us permission to send to you). We keep this information for our internal use; we do not share it with others. This information is in no way tied to your personal information, including your email address. 

**Our Web site uses cookies to store information between users' visits to our site and for the duration of the visit, also known as a session.** Cookies are a mechanism to remember information about a visitor when he or she navigates from one Web page to another. Our Web site uses cookies to hold users' unique session identifiers, allowing our Web server to serve correct information back to the user. Such information includes the user's shopping cart items, or whether he or she is logged in when requesting to view or modify personal information, including your email address, which may have been stored in our database in the past. Our Web site cookies do not hold any personal identifiable information. Disabling or rejecting cookies will prevent users from adding items to the cart and checking out; however, standard browsing on our Web site does not require cookies. 

**PSSL.com uses tracking technologies** to send anonymous information about your browsing habits to a third party company. Links in our email communications to recipients are tracked via Web Beacons once you land on our website. Web Beacons appear on our website as 1x1 transparent images which transmit information such as your operating system, browser, resolution, geographical location, products ordered, and order total. This information is used to help our webmasters and marketers understand the behavior of visitors to our website and understand the effectiveness of online and email messages. Your information is submitted anonymously, and no sensitive or personally identifiable information is transmitted. 

**When you subscribe to our newsletters, PSSL.com asks you for contact information** (your name and email address). When you sign up for our newsletters we use your name and email address to send you our newsletters and to inform you of sales, new product introductions and special offers we think you might find useful. 

**Product Review:** When you submit a product review on our website, you are required to log into your customer account. Your comments, first name, city, and state will be displayed. However, no information that would allow others to contact you will be disclosed by us. Your information will be used for no other purpose than to allow you to submit product reviews. 

**Send to a friend:** The information collected (friend's name and email address) is used to send a one time only email to the friend letting them know about the product that the user recommends. 

**If you place an online order, our secure order form requests contact, billing, and financial information** (such as your credit card numbers for purchases). Contact information from the order form (email address, name, billing and shipping address, and phone number) is used to send orders and information about our company to you. Your contact information, including email address, is also used to get in touch with you should we have questions regarding your order or should we need to notify you of the status of your order. And yes, you can opt not to get email from us, as described in the opt-out section below. The credit card information we collect is used to bill you for products you purchase. For your convenience, your information including credit card and order history is stored on a secure server that allows you to reorder by entering your email address and password. You will automatically be registered to receive our weekly newsletter unless you opt-out at the time of purchase. You may opt-out at any later time by following the unsubscribe instructions in the newsletter. 

We have several types of third-party relationships. 

  1. We have an affiliate program that allows other websites to earn money by directing people (through links) to our website. If you sign up as an affiliate, your contact information (website address and related information, email address, mailing and payment addresses, and contact information) is sent to a third party who activates your affiliate status and pays you based on the sales you generate for PSSL.com, Inc. The third-party affiliate manager (Commission Junction) has its own privacy policy. Please be aware that when signing up as an affiliate you are entering information on a the third party's website (not PSSL.com's site) even though our logo frames the Web page you are visiting.
  2. We use third-party intermediaries. When you purchase from us, we send your credit card information, name, and billing address to credit card companies for verification and to authorize your purchase.
