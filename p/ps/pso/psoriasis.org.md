The National Psoriasis Foundation respects the privacy of each individual who contacts us. We are grateful for your support and the critical role you play in helping us continue our valuable work. To protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

### Collection and Use of Data

In order to provide our users the best experience possible on our website, we collect information about visitors to our site, such as the number of visitors, what pages they access and the length of their visit. This type of information is shared outside the National Psoriasis Foundation only as compiled data and no information that can identify any one individual.

We collect information such as your name, postal address and e-mail address when you choose to share that information. Examples include: when you request information from us, register for an event, make a donation or contact us offline. This information is used to provide you with information or deliver the materials you have requested. If you provide your postal or e-mail address to the National Psoriasis Foundation, you may receive periodic communications from us. We also collect demographic and profile data at our site and in our databases. We use the data you provide to tailor your experience on our website and develop programs and services that might be of interest to you.

### Opting Out of Communications

We send out electronic and other communications to National Psoriasis Foundation site visitors to highlight news, information and opportunities available from the National Psoriasis Foundation. You can elect not to receive communications from us, either by updating the communications preferences on your [My Account page](https://web.archive.org/netcommunity/myaccount) or by contacting us at [privacy@psoriasis.org](mailto:privacy@psoriasis.org). In addition, all National Psoriasis Foundation e-mail communications have easy-to-follow unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each e-mail.

### Use of Cookies

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your web browser on your computer's hard drive. The National Psoriasis Foundation website uses cookies to verify forms and to enable users with online accounts to use the "Remember Login" option to have their login information automatically saved for them. Consult the help menu on your web browser regarding options for preventing or accepting cookies. Please be aware that if you block cookies, some of our website functions may not be available to you.

### Sharing Information with Others

The National Psoriasis Foundation, like many other nonprofit organizations, occasionally makes available only our constituent's names and postal addresses to companies, predominantly other nonprofit organizations. We carefully screen these organizations. These practices help us reduce the cost of reaching more individuals with information about psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.

You can request that we do not share your information by e-mailing us at [privacy@psoriasis.org](mailto:privacy@psoriasis.org). If you use more than one e-mail address or postal address, please identify each one.

We will also share such personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our rights, or protect the safety of our constituents or others.

### Children's Privacy Online

Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. For that reason, we adhere to the Federal Trade Commission's 1998 [Children's Online Privacy Protection Act](http://www.onguardonline.gov/topics/kids-privacy.aspx)Â (COPPA). As a result, we require parental consent before children under 13 can access certain parts of the National Psoriasis Foundation website. We also provide parents reasonable access to information collected from their children and the ability to correct or remove that information.

The "Youth" section of the National Psoriasis Foundation website includes several pages where children are directly asked to provide certain personal information. This information is limited to:

  * First name, age, country of residence and e-mail address (on pages where children submit a question); 
  * First name only and e-mail address (on specific message boards for kids, youth and teens; e-mail address is optional). 



The National Psoriasis Foundation uses the information to help provide the most appropriate and thorough answer to questions, or in the case of the message boards, to help children identify themselves to other message board participants. E-mail addresses will only be used when necessary to seek more detailed information in order to answer a submitted question, when it is appropriate for providing a private answer to a question or when it is necessary to make direct contact because of a message post on message boards.

Information about children is not collected for any other purposes, including marketing to children or disclosure to a third party.

### Security

In order to prevent unauthorized access and protect our users' personal information, we strive to maintain physical, electronic and administrative safeguards to secure the information we collect online. For example, online shopping and contributions are processed using a secure server. This secure server software, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access with the use of digital certificates.

### Links to Other Sites

Our site provides links to other websites where you can find out more about our partners, other organizations, or products and services related to psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Please note that the National Psoriasis Foundation is not responsible for the information practices of linked sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of each site you visit.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Changes to the National Psoriasis Foundation privacy policy will be posted on our website. We encourage you to review our policy from time to time.
