# Privacy Policy : PSI

Population Services International is committed to your right to privacy, and to maintaining the highest level of security for your credit card transactions. Our Privacy Policy is intended to ensure that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner.

Below are answers to commonly asked questions:

**Is it safe to give online?**

Absolutely. PSI is grateful for the donations that help us continue our valuable work. It is very important to us that your personal information remain secure. When you donate through psi.org, your credit card information is secured by a reputable security company. Also, your credit card number is used only for that particular transaction and is not stored.

You will also notice in your web site address bar that the domain name starts with an “https” when you are on our donation pages. This indicates that information is transmitted using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), which means it is encyrpted before it is sent from your computer over the Internet to our website. This encryption actually makes your donation transaction more secure than using a credit card in physical form at a store. If you have any questions regarding the security of your credit card donation online, please e-mail us at [webmaster@psi.org](mailto:webmaster@psi.org).
