# Privacy Statement - Pacific Standard

PSMag.com respects each individual’s right to personal privacy, and there is no need to identify yourself in order to view anything posted on our site. However, to join in the conversation or to access some off-site features, we do ask that you register. We will collect and use information through our website only in the ways disclosed in this statement.

PSMag.com may collect information through our website at several points.

We may collect general data — but not personally identifiable information — such as the geographic location of your Internet service provider, or whether you typed in our web address or linked in from another site. We may also keep track of the pages that you access and how long you stay on any given page in order to determine the popularity of types of content or subject matter.

Visitors are encouraged to become registered users of the site, and in this instance some personal information is requested. We will never share this information with outside parties, but we will use it both to ensure that civil discourse is maintained and to develop demographic information about visitors to PSMag.com. In collecting demographic information individuals will never be identified. Registered users will not receive additional announcements from us.

Visitors are also encouraged to sign up for weekly newsletters and alerts from PSMAg.com. Newsletter users may receive additional announcements from us.

When users sign up or login to comment, that will be protected by industry-standard security measures.

We may employ cookies. A cookie is a small text file that our Web server places on a user’s computer hard drive to be a unique identifier. Cookies enable Pacific Standard to track usage patterns. Any cookies we use will not collect personally identifiable information and will have expiration dates.

We offer links to other websites. Please note: When you click on links to other websites, we encourage you to read their privacy policies. Their standards may differ from ours.

Our website publishes comments and offers forums. Please be advised that information posted in these venues becomes public knowledge.
