## Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices.

We collect information to enable the online converter to work and to monitor site activity. 

The primary information we collect is:

  * Name of files submitted to us
  * Size of files submitted to us
  * Network addresses of users



We perform several authentication checks in order to only allow the same computer that uploaded a raw file to be able to download the resulting converted file.

Our automatic processes are designed to delete all files converted on our site within 30 minutes of being converted. 

We use return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

We use Cookies to provide additional security for downloading of converted documents.  Some of our advertisers use cookies in order to properly credit us for displaying their adds.  The Cookies themselves tell us nothing about you personally.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to modify our marketing efforts.

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy  
policies, please send us an e-mail.
