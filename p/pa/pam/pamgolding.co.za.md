# Privacy Policy | Pam Golding Properties

We are committed to **ensuring that your privacy is protected**. Below, we’ve outlined the procedures we have in place to safeguard your privacy, ways we use the information we collect as well as ways to limit the use of this information **according to your preferences**.

## Pam Golding Group Website Privacy Policy

  1. **Introduction**
    1. This Website Privacy Policy (" **Privacy Policy** ") is provided by PGP (as defined under the [**Terms and Conditions**](https://web.archive.org/terms-and-conditions)) and pertains to the personal information which PGP may from time to time collect from you when you access and/or use the Website ([www.pamgolding.co.za](http://www.pamgolding.co.za/)).
    2. PGP is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. This Privacy Policy explains how we use personal information we collect about you and how you can instruct us if you prefer to limit the use of that information. 
    3. In this Privacy Policy the term " _third parties_ " means persons, firms or companies which are not subsidiaries of or otherwise associated with PGP.
  2. **The information we collect**
    1. Whilst using the Website, PGP may electronically collect, store and use certain " _personal information_ " about you as is set out in this Privacy Policy. The term " ** _personal information_** " shall bear the same meaning under this Privacy Policy as defined in the Protection of Personal Information Act, 4 of 2013. 
    2. In using and/or accessing the Website you may provide us with (or we may, from time to time, require you to provide us with) certain " _personal information_ " which may include, but is not limited to, information pertaining to your:
      1. name and surname;
      2. email address; and
      3. mobile number.
  3. **Cookies**
    1. The Website uses "cookies" or similar technology through which we may automatically collect personal information about you (being your name, surname, email address and mobile number). "Cookies" will further be used to record the properties that you have browsed. We collect this information in order that we may show those properties to you again and provide you with recommendations based on your search criteria. Please see the terms and conditions applicable to " ** _Cookies_** " under our [**Terms and Conditions**](https://web.archive.org/terms-and-conditions). ****
    2. **You can set your browser to notify you when you are sent a "Cookie", giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it.**   If you accept a "cookie" or fail to deny the use of "cookies", you consent to our use of your personal information collected using "cookies" (subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions).
    3. The Website also utilises remarketing (or similar audiences) in Google AdWords, allowing us to show ads to users who have previously visited the Website as they browse the Web. In other words, if you visit our Website and then visit another unrelated website, an ad for our Website may be shown on that site. Through this we are able to present you with highly relevant advertisements and offers across the Web.
    4. The remarketing tag is placed across all non-sensitive pages on our Website. When you visit different pages, your "cookie" identity is added to the remarketing list.
    5. If you do not accept Google's use of "cookies" you can opt out of Google's use of "cookies" by visiting Google's Ads Settings by clicking on: <http://www.google.com/settings/ads>.  Alternatively you can opt out of a third-party's use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page by clicking on: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>.
  4. **Social media**
    1. If you share our Website or Website Content (as defined under the **_[Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/terms-and-conditions)_** ) on any social media (such as Facebook or Twitter) your personal information (e.g. your name and the fact that you are interested in anything advertised or displayed on the Website) will be visible to all the visitors of your personal webpage on Facebook and/or Twitter. 
    2. **When you use social media websites the terms and conditions (including the privacy policy/ies) of such social media website/s will apply to you.**
    3. **PGP is not responsible for the processing of personal information or the privacy policy/ies of such social media website/s. This Privacy Policy is therefore not applicable to such social media website/s.**
    4. **If you disclose your personal information to a third party such as Facebook or Twitter, PGP will not be liable for any loss or damage, howsoever arising (whether direct, indirect or consequential), suffered by you as a result of the disclosure of your personal information to such third parties. This is because PGP do not regulate or control how such third parties use your personal information. You should always ensure that you read and understand the privacy policies of such third parties / social media website/s.**
  5. **Our Facebook page**
    1. We have a Facebook page.
