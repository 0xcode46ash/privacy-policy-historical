# PJ Static Pages: Privacy and Terms of Use

**Overview**

Pajamas Media is committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users. Our readers’ privacy and confidentiality is of the utmost importance to us, our Contributors and our advertiser clients. Our reputation and integrity is directly related to how we serve you, our readers, and protect your privacy. At the end of this policy we have provided contact information, should you have any additional questions.

**Applicability of Policy**

To try and bring you offers that are of interest to you, we have relationships with other companies that we allow to place ads on our Web pages, and on the weblogs of our contributors.

This privacy policy applies only to advertising-related information that is collected and stored by Pajamas Media’s ad server when advertising media is delivered to visitors of participating blog sites. The privacy policy is not applicable to each individual blog site itself. Each participating blog may have its own privacy policy, which we encourage you to read and understand. Pajamas Media has no authority over each web site’s individual privacy policy, only over information collected about the advertising displayed throughout the sites in the overall blog network.

**Information Collected**

Pajamas Media does not obtain any personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, phone number, or email address, when you visit a blog within the network. Pajamas Media may, however, automatically collect non-personally identifiable information about you which is specific to how you use the Internet, such as the IP address of the server your computer is logged into, your browser type, your screen resolution setting, the Web pages you visited and whether you responded to any ads delivered by Pajamas Media on a blog site. This non-personally identifiable information collected by Pajamas Media is used for the purpose of determining which ads to deliver and for measuring aggregate advertising display and response for client and network reporting.

Also, as a result of your visit to our site and to our participating blogs, our ad server companies may collect information such as your domain type, your IP address and clickstream information. For further information, consult the privacy policies of:

<http://www.247realmedia.com/privacy.html>

Information collected about individual visitors that is stored in the ad server database will not be sold or disclosed to any merchant or third party, except when required by law or court order or as set forth in this Policy. Pajamas Media does disclose aggregate advertising information, which does not identify individuals or any personally identifiable information, to business partners, advertisers, bloggers, and other advertising third parties. Pajamas Media also reserves the right to use such non-personally identifiable information gathered on bloggers for promoting Pajamas Media products and services or the products and services of Pajamas Media advertisers and sponsors.

**Cookies**

Pajamas Media uses browser cookies to enable advertising. Cookies are small files that your Web browser places on your computer’s hard drive to record information about your visit. The Pajamas Media cookie will not be associated with any personal information about you and Pajamas Media will not be able to identify you personally when you visit any blog. Pajamas Media cookies do not damage your system or files in any way. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but you can change your browser settings to prevent the acceptance of cookies if you desire. All third party cookies that are used to track or manage user experience must be set outside of the Pajamas Media or blog domains.

**Disclosure**

Pajamas Media openly volunteers its practices of collecting information, its targeting capabilities and its use of cookies. If you have any questions pertaining to this privacy policy and its contents, please direct your correspondence to privacy@pajamasmedia.com.

**Notification of Changes to Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time as needed. If Pajamas Media decides to change the privacy policy, we will post these changes on this web page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. It is your obligation to review this Privacy Statement periodically, and your continued use of the bloggers after changes have been posted will be deemed to be your acceptance of the revised Statement.

Privacy Statement last updated, November 2005.
