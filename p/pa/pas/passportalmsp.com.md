**Welcome!**

This web site, PASSPORTAL.it, is administered by PASSPORTAL Inc. We appreciate you visiting our site and considering our service. PASSPORTAL recognizes the importance of information by which you can be identified, such as your name, address, or e-mail address.

When you visit this web site, PASSPORTAL may collect Personally Identifiable Information about you, either directly (where you are asked to provide the data, for example during registration for the service) or indirectly, as explained later in this policy. PASSPORTAL will, however, only use this Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy and is _committed_ to protecting the personal information collected.

This Privacy Policy sets out the purposes of PASSPORTAL's data handling in respect to this web site, the use of cookies and how to exercise your rights for your Personally Identifiable Information.

By using the PASSPORTAL service and this website, you consent to the information practices described in this policy. Keep in mind that your use of the PASSPORTAL service is also subject to, and controlled by, the PASSPORTAL Terms and Conditions and the PASSPORTAL User Agreement.

**Data Handler**

The Data Handler and Contact Person for Data Protection is Colin Knox. Should you have any questions, recommendations, or complaints about this Privacy Policy or our data handling activities, please contact us.

_via e-mail at:_[ _privacy@passportal.it_](mailto:privacy@passportal.it) __

**Data Handling**

Data handling associated with customer support for the PASSPORTAL website and service is located at the Data Handler’s address and is subject to Canadian Laws. The data centers where PASSPORTAL's servers are housed are located in Canada and the United States of America, and are subject to respective Federal Laws.

**Rights of the Data Subject**

You can request a summary of the information that we have for you by contacting us at [privacy@passportal.it](mailto:privacy@passportal.it).  If you find any errors, we will correct them in a timely manner.

These are your rights as set out by paragraph 12 of the Canadian Privacy Act:

_" **12.** (1) Subject to this Act, every individual who is a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the _[Immigration and Refugee Protection Act](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5) _has a right to and shall, on request, be given access to_

_(_ a _) any personal information about the individual contained in a personal information bank; and_

_(_ b _) any other personal information about the individual under the control of a government institution with respect to which the individual is able to provide sufficiently specific information on the location of the information as to render it reasonably retrievable by the government institution._

_Other rights relating to personal information_

_(2) Every individual who is given access under paragraph (1)(_ a _) to personal information that has been used, is being used or is available for use for an administrative purpose is entitled to_

_(_ a _) request correction of the personal information where the individual believes there is an error or omission therein;_

_(_ b _) require that a notation be attached to the information reflecting any correction requested but not made; and_

_(_ c _) require that any person or body to whom that information has been disclosed for use for an administrative purpose within two years prior to the time a correction is requested or a notation is required under this subsection in respect of that information_

_(i) be notified of the correction or notation, and_

_(ii) where the disclosure is to a government institution, the institution make the correction or notation on any copy of the information under its control._

_Extension of right of access by order_

_(3) The Governor in Council may, by order, extend the right to be given access to personal information under subsection (1) to include individuals not referred to in that subsection and may set such conditions as the Governor in Council deems appropriate. "_

This means that if we have incorrect information about you, you have the right to correct it.  If you feel that we have wrongly used your data, or if you feel there is no reason we should have it (for example, if you delete your account), you can request that we remove every reference to you in our systems. 

**Changing or Removing Information**

In an effort to facilitate your ability to exercise your rights, and ensure that you have appropriate control over your Personally Identifiable Information, the PASSPORTAL service provides an interface where you can change your Registration or Customer Information.

If at any time you would like to delete your Personally Identifiable Information from other systems outside of the PASSPORTAL service (for example, customer service emails) you can send an e-mail request to [privacy@passportal.it](mailto:privacy@passportal.it).  After receipt of your request, such information will be deleted assuming (i) you are current with all payment obligations; (ii) PASSPORTAL does not believe it is reasonably necessary to keep such information for any pending legal action; and (iii) we are under no other legal obligation to retain such information.  If such information is deleted, however, any unfulfilled subscriptions will be cancelled without refund and you will have to re-register with PASSPORTAL in order to use the PASSPORTAL service.  Because of the irreversible nature of account deletions, we will attempt to verify your identity as the proper account holder, or ask you to confirm your intent before proceeding.

Since Anonymous Information is by its very nature non-personally identifying, we have no way to locate Anonymous Information obtained by your use of the service. In addition, Anonymous Information is often aggregated. Therefore, we cannot remove Anonymous Information obtained from you or as a result of your usage of the website or service.

**Collection of Personally Identifiable Information**

Personally Identifiable Information is information that can be used to locate you, contact you, or determine your specific identity. When other information is linked to Personally Identifiable Information, it also becomes Personally Identifiable Information.

In general, you can visit the PASSPORTAL website without providing Personally Identifiable Information. It is PASSPORTAL's goal to collect as little Personally Identifiable Information as possible, however there may be some occasions where it may be collected. For example:

1.       When you register for the PASSPORTAL service, you are required to provide a User ID, or an equivalent third party authentication service. You may also optionally provide an Email address ("Registration Information"). An activation code will be sent to the email address provided to confirm its validity and to ensure that it was not accidentally mistyped. The PASSPORTAL application provides an interface where you can correct this information, request a new activation code to be sent, or even change the email associated with your account in the future. Should a valid email account not be provided and confirmed, PASSPORTAL will not be able to provide you with any customer support requests.

2.       When you place an order or subscribe to a paid version of the PASSPORTAL service, we may collect the appropriate billing information, including your credit card number, expiration date, and billing address ("Billing Information"). This information may be associated to your Registration Information in a database and kept for future purchases.

3.       When you submit a request for more information, support or assistance, PASSPORTAL will keep a record of the request and the manner in which it was processed ("Customer Service Information").

4.       We may ask you for voluntary personal information at other times, including but not limited to when you provide opinions, enter a contest or promotion, or report a problem with the PASSPORTAL service ("Optional Information").

5.       Should you decide to comment on the PASSPORTAL blog, forum, or community board you may need to provide an email address – this _will not_ be made visible to others. You may also optionally choose to provide your name and a URL – these _will_ be made visible to others.

Your response to the above requests for information is completely voluntary: if you do not provide the information we request, you can still visit the informative sections of our website but you may be unable to register or maintain an account with the PASSPORTAL service.

By submitting your information you consent to the use of that information as set out in this Privacy Policy.

**Collection of Non-Personally Identifiable (Anonymous) Information**

Whenever you visit the PASSPORTAL site, we may also automatically receive and record information from your browser, including your IP address, your computer's name, the type and version of your web browser, referrer addresses, and other generally-accepted log information. We may also record page views (hit counts) and other general statistical and tracking information.

This information is collected automatically by the system and the software procedures dedicated to the operating of this website which requires no action on your part. With the exception of your IP address which is used to support various security related features, this information is not associated with your Personally Identifiable Information.

This data enables us to become more familiar with which parts of the world visitors to our site come from, how often they visit, and what parts of the site they visit most often. We analyze this data for trends and statistics, we use them exclusively to help us better understand how our site is being used, to improve the value and user-friendliness of our web site as well as detect any technical problems as early as possible. To help us record and understand our website traffic we may also use a third party service, such as Google Analytics or website page counters – in which case absolutely _no_ Personally Identifiable Information is recorded by the third party service, nor associated with the aggregate anonymous website data.

**Sensitive Data**

PASSPORTAL does not specifically seek to collect sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (such as data revealing political opinions, religious beliefs or data concerning health or sex life) through this site. If PASSPORTAL does seek to collect such data, your prior consent hereto will be asked.

The very nature, however, of the PASSPORTAL service is to provide a place for you to store and protect sensitive data such as, but not limited to, passwords. The data you choose to store and manage via the PASSPORTAL application is not considered "collected" data in that it is encrypted and cannot be decrypted or read by PASSPORTAL or any other third party. Only those with access to your private decryption key can decrypt and read the data you store at PASSPORTAL.

**Data Processing**

Your Personally Identifiable Information will be processed manually and/or by automated systems that guarantee security and confidentiality, in strict accordance with, and complete respect of, the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

**Cookies**

Some pages on this site use "cookies," which are small files that the site places on your hard drive for identification purposes. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard disk which help our servers recognize your computer when you visit again, so that it is easier for you to navigate our website and make the best use of your visit. You should note that cookies cannot read data off of your hard drive. Your web browser may allow you to be notified when you are receiving a cookie, giving you the choice to accept it or not.

By not accepting cookies, you may not be able to access certain functionalities on this site. In particular, PASSPORTAL application requires the use of cookies and may have limited functionality if you do not allow cookies.

**Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information**

Your Personally Identifiable Information will not be matter of dissemination. The data will be disclosed to the employees or third parties expressly appointed by the Data Handler as Data processor and the individuals in charge for the data handling.

We will not provide, sell, barter or trade any information about you to/with any third parties, without your express permission and, above all, we will not sell this data to commercial users or make them available in any other form.

In general, we will not disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to unaffiliated third parties without your express consent. If we seek your consent to disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to a third party, we will do so unambiguously, explaining precisely what information we seek to disclose, the entity to whom we wish to disclose it, and the purpose for the disclosure.

There are, however, some limited circumstances in which we may need to disclose Personally Identifiable Information about a user, and we want you to know about them:

1.       We may employ other companies to perform functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders, providing customer service, handling credit card payments, or other functions necessary to our business. We may therefore need to share your Personally Identifiable Information to banks or financial institutions, service companies, consultants, contractors and to the relevant Authorities imposed by law. The data you submit may be transmitted abroad, only to our affiliated companies, in compliance with the requirements set forth by the privacy laws in force. However, we will provide them with only that information necessary to perform their functions, and will not allow them to use that information for any other purpose.

2.       Responses to requests for information necessary to provide you with the products you purchase or subscribe to through the PASSPORTAL service may contain Personally Identifiable Information. PASSPORTAL will provide the authors of such products the information you supply in response to those requests. The information practices of those publishers are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Your name, address, phone number, and email address, will not be shared with the Authors.

3.       We may reveal a user's identity (or whatever information we know about that individual) if we believe that user is harming or interfering with other PASSPORTAL users, anyone else, or violating (either intentionally or unintentionally) our Terms and Conditions or infringing any of PASSPORTAL's legal rights.

4.       PASSPORTAL will reveal information, including Personally Identifiable Information, to the extent it reasonably believes it is required to do so by law. If we receive legal process calling for the disclosure of any of your personally identifiable information we will, if permitted by law, attempt to notify you via your e-mail address, if, and only if, we have one on record, within a reasonable amount of time before we respond to the request.

5.       PASSPORTAL may transfer information it collects, including any Personally Identifiable Information, in connection with a sale of all or most of the assets of the company. Should your Personally Identifiable Information be transferred as the result of such sale, you will be notified in your Account.

**Use and disclosure of Anonymous Information**

Anonymous Information is any information collected from you or by the PASSPORTAL service, other than Personally Identifiable Information, including aggregate information derived from Personally Identifiable Information.

PASSPORTAL may use Anonymous Information to improve the PASSPORTAL website and service, to monitor traffic and general usage patterns, and for other general business purposes.

PASSPORTAL may disclose Anonymous Information to third parties for a variety of business reasons, including to publishers to inform them as to what content is appealing to their readers, to advertisers to inform them of the usage habits or characteristics of the interested audience, and to potential investors so that they may better understand PASSPORTAL's user base, etc.

Anonymous Information will not include any Personally Identifiable Information and PASSPORTAL will not disclose any Personally Identifiable Information except as expressly stated elsewhere in this policy.

**Security**

We employ reasonable and current security methods to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information. Your personal data will be stored within a database that is located behind a firewall. The server housing the database is physically protected at a secure data center.

Any transmission to the PASSPORTAL web site or service of Personally Identifiable Information or credit card information uses SSL encryption.

**Other Web Sites**

Please note that the informative note is given only for the PASSPORTAL website and application: this Privacy Policy does not extend to third party sites linked to this web site.

**Children**

The PASSPORTAL service is not directed to children (persons under the age of 18), and we do not knowingly collect, either online or offline, personally identifiable information from children. 

**Amendments**

From time to time, PASSPORTAL may change this Privacy Policy. If we make any changes regarding disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to third parties, then we'll notify you by email prior to the date the modified policy takes effect. We will also post noticeable advisement of the new policy on our home page. Any new policy will have prospective effect only, meaning it will not apply to information previously gathered without your express consent. 

Please check this Privacy Policy from time to time for any changes.
