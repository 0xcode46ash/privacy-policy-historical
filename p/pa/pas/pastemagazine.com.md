About Your Privacy & Security

Paste Magazine cares a great deal about our customers. So we do everything we can to ensure you have a positive experience with us. That said, here's what we can say confidently regarding the privacy of your information and the security of your transactions in plain English -- no legalspeak here. 

Privacy

We do not rent or sell our customer lists or email lists. In other words, information you give us stays with us ... with one exception. Because we work directly in partnership with many of the artists whose CDs you see for sale here at PasteMagazine.com and at our sister site PasteMusic.com, we will upon request provide your name, email address and mailing address to an artist whose CD you've actually purchased. In other words, if you order Live at the 40Watt by Vigilantes of Love and they ask us for a list of folks that have purchased their CDs, well then, your name, address and email address will be on that list. We'll never pass on your credit card information or your phone number. If we ever sell the company, our customer data will be included in that transaction with the understanding that the new owners abide by the same terms. 

Our site uses cookies to maintain information about your shopping cart. In fact, the shopping cart will not work without cookies. Therefore, you must enable cookies to effectively use our site. But rest assured, the only thing we use cookies for is keeping track of your shopping cart! We do not use them to keep track of any of your personal information. 

Security 

Your order information is encrypted using SSL (secure sockets layer) technology provided by Thawte, a leading supporter of secure digital commerce. This means that when you click "Submit My Order" in the shopping cart, only PasteMusic.com will see your private information. Furthermore, we do not store your credit card number. 

You must have an SSL-compliant browser. We suggest using [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/), [Opera](http://www.opera.com/) or [Internet Explorer](http://www.microsoft.com/ie/).
