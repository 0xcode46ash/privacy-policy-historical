It enables the website to ‘remember’ little bits of information between pages or visits, such as your actions and preferences (such as login preferences, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another. The collected data allows us to improve the Website in the future.

The cookies we use are “functional” and “analytical” cookies. The functional cookies are needed to make the site work. The analytical cookies allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around the site when they are using it.
