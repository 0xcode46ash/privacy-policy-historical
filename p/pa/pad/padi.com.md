**Security**

When you begin a checkout or redemption process within our sites, we require that a secure connection between your computer and our server be established. To do this, our sites utilize a technology called Secure Socket Layers (SSL). SSL encrypts your personal and credit card information before it travels over the Internet. SSL technology is the industry standard for secure online transactions. Because we use SSL, registering on PADI eLearning/KnowledgeDirectWEB is just as safe as giving your credit card number over the phone. SSL is an industry standard with advanced encryption technology that works with current versions of Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, Safari and numerous other web browsers. A secure connection is maintained until the checkout process is either completed or canceled by the user. Although we use these industry-standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.
