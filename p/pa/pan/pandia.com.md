### Email addresses

Pandia will never give your email address to any other company or organisation, nor will we ever use it to send you "junk" or "spam" email. If you subscribe to a newsletter or news service, a newsletter is what you get. Period.

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information. 

Our site's registration forms may require users to give us contact information (like their name and email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We may use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about Pandia. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings. 

Demographic and profile data may also be collected at our site. We may use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. This information may be shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. But we will not under any circumstance give the visitors' e-mail address, name or address to advertisers.
