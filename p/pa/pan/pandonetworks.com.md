**INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT**

Pando **does not** collect personally identifying information when you use our products and services. Pando offers content delivery services that do not require you to register or provide any personal information to us. However, in order to operate our Network we may collect the following types of information:

**Log information –** When you use PMB to download a file published into our Network by one of our media customers, our servers automatically record information that pertains to your file transfer. These logs may include information such as your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your transfer as well as reports on the progress and completion of the file transfer.

**Crash Reports –** A sample of crashes in PMB may be reported to an automatic analysis system. These reports are then analyzed by our engineers and issues are fixed in future versions of the software. These reports help us to maintain and improve the quality of our products and services.

**User communications –** When you send email or other communications to Pando, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.

If you would like to contact the advertisers, third party advertising networks and third-party advertising serving companies or other companies with which we have relationships to learn more about their privacy policies and what options (if any) they offer to opt out of their data collection, please visit their web site(s).
