# Privacy

Panasonic Australia Pty Limited ABN 83 001 592 187 (Panasonic) is committed to protecting your privacy.

All information gathered by Panasonic will be stored securely.

## Collection and Use of Information

The information Panasonic collects about consumers and website users will be used only for research and permission based marketing activities. Findings from research will be reported in aggregate form to Panasonic and its related entities.

Panasonic does not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily submit such information to us such as by joining My Panasonic, registering a product you have purchased, subscribing to a newsletter, filling out a form or survey, entering competitions, promotions or similar. Personally identifiable information includes names, addresses, phone, fax or email addresses. Any personal information collected on our website will state to the user that personal information is being collected.

We do not wish to obtain personal information from children who are using our website unsupervised. Thus, we ask children to obtain the consent of their parent or guardian before providing us with any personal information.

It is our policy to send e-mail for marketing or promotional purposes only to consumers who give us permission to do so. In every such e-mail we will have instructions on how you may unsubscribe from the e-mail list. From this point your information will generally be deleted from our database. In some cases, we may need to retain some information (for example, to record entrants in a promotion or to fulfil a request that you have made), but we will respect your wishes only to use the information for the purpose that you provided it.

Those who request information and request receipt of continuing marketing and other information from Panasonic, will occasionally receive e-mail communications to provide information which we think you will find useful/beneficial, including information about new products and services.

By joining My Panasonic, registering a product you have purchased, subscribing to a newsletter or purchasing an extended warranty, you are also requested that we send you information about new Panasonic products, innovations and technologies, as well as offers and promotions. If you provide us with an indication of the types of products that you are interested in, we may use this information to tailor our communications with you to suit your preferences.

If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to fulfil your request, complete your registration or provide you with the information that you want.

## Disclosure of Information 

Panasonic will not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others.

However, we may share information with external companies, usually during competitions, promotions or similar. These external companies shall be bound by Panasonic's privacy policy. In addition, agreements shall be in place to ensure our privacy policy is adhered to.

We may also provide your information to others if required or permitted to do so by law in accordance with the National Privacy Principles.

## Review and Removal of your Personally Identifiable Data 

Panasonic respects your right to access personal information we have collected about you at any time and make changes you deem appropriate.

Personal details can be changed at any time by contacting the Privacy Officer by E-Mail at _[privacyofficer@au.panasonic.com](mailto:privacyofficer@au.panasonic.com)_ or by mail to the 'Privacy Officer, Panasonic Australia Pty. Limited, 1 Innovation Road, Macquarie Park, NSW 2113'.

Panasonic accepts your right to opt out of any consumer research Panasonic conducts at any time.

## Cookies and Other Tracking Methods 

We track traffic patterns throughout the URL's (web-sites) registered to Panasonic. Panasonic may use a feature of your browser called a 'cookie'. Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on our website, to help you navigate a website as easily as possible. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out your identity or the identities of any of our users - they only identify your computer to our servers when you visit our website.

## Security 

We use industry-standard methods to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorised access. Among other techniques, we usually store such information on a computer behind our "firewall" in a secure location, and we restrict the number of employees internally who can access such data.

## Amendments

Amendments to this policy will be posted on this web-site and will be effective when posted.

*As amended 6 April 2011.
