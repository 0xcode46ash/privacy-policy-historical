# Panoramio - Privacy Notice

Last updated: 09/09/2008

The [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/privacy.html) describes how we treat personal information when you use Google's products and services, including information provided when you use Panoramio. In addition, the following describes our privacy practices that are specific to Panoramio.

  1. **Personal information**
    * You need a [Panoramio Account](https://web.archive.org/signup) ("Account") to upload photos to Panoramio. Google asks for some personal information when you create a Panoramio Account, including your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access. You may also be asked to create a unique Panoramio username.
    * You may view photos posted on Panoramio by other users without registering for an account.
    * When you use Panoramio, Google's servers automatically record certain information about your use. Similar to other web services, Google records information such as account activity (including storage usage and number of log-ins), data displayed or clicked on (including UI links); and other [log information](http://www.google.com/privacy_faq.html#serverlogs) (including browser type, IP-address, date and time of access, cookie ID, and referrer URL).
  2. **Uses**

Google stores, maintains and processes your photos and account information in order to provide the Panoramio service to you and to operate and improve our services. Google may store your photos on a server hosted by a third party provider, however no user-identifiable information (beyond the image itself) is shared by Google with the third party provider. Beyond the storage of these photos, the third party provider is not authorized to use your photos in any way.

  3. **Information sharing and onward transfer**
    * Users who view your photos homepage will see information about you including your photos, and your username. 
    * If other users add you to their Favorites, those users will see a notification when you upload new photos to Panoramio. 
    * Users may be able to see your photos through searches on Panoramio, Google, and through third party services that access publicly available information on the web. 
    * Users may comment on your photos; these comments can be seen by anyone who visits your photos homepage
    * We do not sell, rent or otherwise share your personal information with any third parties except in the limited circumstances described in the [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html), such as when we believe we are required to do so by law. 
    * Google may review the content of a photos homepage if a user complaint is received , or if we have reason to believe that the account is used in violation of the [Panoramio Terms of Service](http://www.panoramio.com/terms).
  4. **Your choices**
    * You may change your username, and other Account information and settings by clicking the "Settings" link in the top right hand corner of a Panoramio webpage after you sign-in.
    * You may also change your preferences for sharing, and licensing your photos by clicking the "Settings" link. If you choose "All rights reserved" no one can make copies or use your photos without your explicit permission. If you choose "Some rights reserved" you keep the copyright to your photos, but you allow some uses of your photos without your explicit permission.
