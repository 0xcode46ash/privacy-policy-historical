By accessing this Site, you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this Policy.

If the changes represent a material departure from our current practices with respect to the use of personal information, the changes will be posted on the Site three days prior to taking effect.

This Policy applies to this Site only and does not apply to Web sites of other entities which link to this Site and/or to which we link. You should carefully review those Web sites’ privacy policies in order to determine how they treat your personal information.

**Collection, Use and Retention of Information**   
When you visit the Site, we collect two types of information: (1) **personal information** about you which you choose to disclose, and (2) **non-personal information** about your visit to the Site that is collected on an aggregate basis as you browse this Site.

**C. E-mail  
**If you choose to correspond with us through e-mail, we may retain the content of your E-mail and our response so that we can more efficiently handle any follow-up questions you may have. From time to time, Pantone may use your personal information to contact you by electronic mail concerning your use of our services. These communications are either to confirm orders placed with us, to inform you of important information regarding your account, or about general services provided by Pantone. If you do not want to receive E-mail from us, please so notify Pantone in writing or you may do so automatically on our [UNSUBSCRIBE](https://web.archive.org/pages/pantone/pantone.aspx?ca=12&pg=19859&) Web page.

**D. Online Greeting Cards  
**If you choose to send an online greeting card using our Site, we collect your E-mail address and your recipient’s E-mail address to allow sending the content and providing confirmation that it has been received. We will not use your recipient’s E-mail address other than to send the greeting card. Our online greeting contents are treated as private correspondence between the sender and the recipient. We will not disclose the contents of any online greeting including your personal message other than to the intended recipient, except under the specific situations outlined in the Paragraph titled "Exceptions" below. Generally, we will not monitor or edit the content of the greetings you send. We may occasionally need to view your message for technical processing purposes or the maintenance of our network. Additionally, if you require our customer service representatives’ assistance in sending a greeting or verifying that a greeting was sent, that representative will be able to access all information about the card, including the recipient’s E-mail address and the personal message. 

**E. Online Surveys  
**The information you provide to Pantone via online surveys and promotions on the Site will be used for internal marketing purposes, including for the development of new services and information and, in certain instances, aggregate results of online surveys (without individual identification) will be also shared with the participants of the surveys. 

**F. myPANTONE    
**myPANTONE.    myPANTONE is an online service that allows users to enrich their color experience.  myPANTONE members can set up unique personal profiles that can be linked together.  myPANTONE members can post and view each others' color palettes, communicate with other members, share color palettes, post comments, and describe their color interests.  (Note that the creation and uploading of palettes require the use of Pantone’s myPANTONE™ palette Software).  To enrich our members' experience, we request and display some personal information to other members and non-member, which allows our users to identify each other and expand their network.  myPANTONE members can change their profile information at any time and can control who their User Profile is viewed by; it can be set to private, public or to be viewed by specified users only. 

myPANTONE collects user submitted information such as name, e-mail address, and age to authenticate users and to send notifications to those users relating to the myPANTONE service. myPANTONE also collects other profile data including but not limited to: personal interests, gender, education and occupation in order to assist users in finding and communicating with each other.

User Profile information including members' pictures (optional) and “handle”, or first names if provided, are displayed to the public to enhance interaction in the myPANTONE community. E-mail addresses are used to invite friends to join myPANTONE. Except as described above, a user's e-mail address is not shared or displayed to people. 

We may also use a user's e-mail address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding our service. Users may choose not to receive e-mail of this type by changing their "notification" setting to “Do not contact me” in their User Profile (my account/edit profile).

**Invitations and Other Communications to Non-members**  
myPANTONE members can invite friends to join the service by sending invitation e-mails via our automated invitation system. myPANTONE stores the e-mail addresses that members provide so that the respondents may be added to the friend's list of the member sending the invitations, and also to send reminders of the invitations.  myPANTONE does not sell these e-mail addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations and reminders (up to three (3) per e-mail address). Recipients of invitations from myPANTONE may contact myPANTONE to request the removal of their information from our database. 

**Commenting on other member Palettes or posting on your own User Profile**   
Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily post public information via a comment on other member palettes or when posting on your own User Profile that that information can be accessed by the public and can in turn be used by those people to send you unsolicited communications. 

**Correcting/Updating or Removing Information**  
myPANTONE users may modify or remove (if not required) any of their personal information at any time by logging into their account and accessing features such as Edit Profile and Account Info. 

**E-mail Choice/Opt-out**   
Members who no longer wish to receive updates or notifications may choose not to by selecting 'Do not send me notification e-mails' in the User Profile (my account/edit profile).  Users who do not wish to receive myPANTONE newsletters may choose not to by selecting “Do not send me myPANTONE newsletters” in the User Profile (my account/edit profile). All notification e-mails and myPANTONE newsletters also include the above instructions for opting-out of those communications in the future. 

  **2\. Web Site Use Information**   
Similar to other commercial Web sites, this Site utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" and Web server logs to collect information about how this Site is used.

**A. What are Cookies and how we use them  
**"Cookies" are small pieces of data that are stored by a user’s Web browser on the user’s hard drive and allow Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Web site. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at the Site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after this Site. Cookies can remember what information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that Web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user’s transactions on related Web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move from Web page to Web page and to complete commercial transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience easier and more personalized.

We use Web site browser software tools such as cookies and Web server logs to gather information about this Site users’ browsing activities in order to constantly improve this Site and better serve our customers. This information assists us to design and arrange our Web pages in a user-friendly manner and to continually improve this Site to better meet the needs of our existing and prospective customers. We do not use these technologies to capture your individual E-mail address or any personally identifying information about you, although they do permit us to send focused online banner advertisements or other such responses to you. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Note, however, that if you choose not to accept cookies, you may not be able to use certain features on this Site, such as favorites, history and you will be unable to use the Pantone online ordering process (shopping cart).

**B. Cookies used by Third Party Advertisers  
**Our ads may be posted on the Internet by third-party advertisers. These third-party advertisers may also use cookies to assess and improve the effectiveness of ads for their clients. They may use anonymous information about your visits to this Site and other Web sites. Such information can include, date/time of banner ad shown, the banner ad that was shown, their cookie, and the IP address. This information can also be used for online preference marketing purposes. Pantone does not use or have access to this information.

**D. Business Transfers**  
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or their assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that all or substantially all of Pantone’s assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 

**E. Sharing Information with Third Parties  
**From time to time, you may notice offers from outside companies advertised on this Site. We take measures to select product or service providers that are responsible and afford privacy protections to their customers.

We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your username and password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. 

**B. Employee Access, Training and Expectations
