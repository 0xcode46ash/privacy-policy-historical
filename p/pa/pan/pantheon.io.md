### Pantheon Systems, Inc. ("Pantheon") Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") covers the information practices of <https://pantheon.io/>. Questions regarding this statement should be e-mailed to [legal@getpantheon.com](mailto:legal@getpantheon.com).

Pantheon has created this Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") to demonstrate our commitment to user and visitor privacy at our web site (the "Site") and within the services (the "Services") delivered by Pantheon. This Privacy Policy describes our information-gathering and dissemination practices. By visiting the Site or using the Services, you are agreeing to the collection and use of information in the manner described below.

### Information Use

Pantheon uses the information that we collect to set up the Services for users and to improve the Site. We may also use the information to contact users and visitors to further discuss their interest in the Site and the Services, or to send users and visitors information regarding Pantheon or its partners, such as new features, promotions and events. To opt out of receiving such information, information to unsubscribe is included in every communication. We may also e-mail to users information regarding updates to the Services or the Site.

All financial and billing information collected through the Site is used solely to check the qualifications of prospective users and to bill for the Services. This billing information is not used by Pantheon for marketing or promotional purposes. Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide content on the Site or the Services, but they are not permitted to collect any information; nor does Pantheon share any user or visitor information with these parties.

### Information Gathered

Registration and Billing Information: When a visitor to the Site registers to become a user of the Services or requests more information about the Services, we require that the visitor provide contact information such as their name, e-mail address and company name and, when applicable, billing information such as billing address and credit card number. We may also ask visitors, users, or prospective users of the Services for additional personal information such as their professional background, technical expertise and plans for using the service. Users and visitors can opt out of providing this additional information by not entering it when asked. However, failure to provide certain requested information may impact a user's or a visitor's experience and the ability to access the Site and Services.

Log Data and Activity Tracking: Pantheon collects certain information from visitors to the Site and users of the Services, such as Internet addresses, browser types, referring domains, time stamps (time page accessed as well as time spent per web page), as well as the specific pages the visitor has requested. This information is logged to help deliver a better user experience, diagnose technical problems, marketing purposes and so that we may better administer the Site and the Services in order to constantly improve the quality of the Services. We may also track and analyze non-identifying activity and aggregate usage-and-volume statistical information from visitors and users, and provide such information to third parties.

Cookies: Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a computer's hard drive. Pantheon uses cookies to tell us whether users and visitors have previously visited the Site or the Services. Pantheon uses both session-based and persistent cookies. Session cookies exist only during one session, and disappear when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer. If the cookie is rejected, access to and usage of the Services may be denied or otherwise limited.

### Stored Data

Users of the Services will be using the Services to store data. Such data may at times be viewed or accessed by Pantheon only for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue or suspected violation of the Terms of Use for the Site and the Services, or as may be required by law. Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their user registration and password. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, Pantheon will not review, share, distribute, print or reference any data stored by users on the Site or the Services.

### Sharing of Information

Pantheon may share aggregated demographic information with partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify an individual person.

Pantheon uses a third-party service provider to manage credit card processing. This service provider is not permitted to store, retain, or use Billing Information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on Pantheon's behalf.

Pantheon may partner with other parties to provide specific services. If a user registers for these services, we will share names or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

From time to time we may provide information about users to Pantheon's subsidiaries and joint ventures in order to provide those users the Services. Each of these entities will comply with the policies described in this Privacy Policy. In addition, if the stock or assets of Pantheon, its subsidiaries, its joint ventures or any combination of such are acquired by another entity, some or all of Pantheon users' and visitors' personal information and hosted data may be provided to such successor. In such a case, the successor will handle the personal information and hosted data in the same manner as provided in this Privacy Policy. Please see our Notice of Changes section below.

Other than as expressly described in this Privacy Policy, Pantheon will not share, sell or rent a user's or a visitor's personally identifiable information or hosted data with anyone outside of Pantheon, without such user's or visitor's prior permission or unless ordered by a court of law.

### Security

Pantheon uses appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect our users' and visitors' information and data against loss, misuse and alteration. We use standard industry practices to help prevent unauthorized use of, access to or alteration of visitor and user information and hosted data. These practices include the appropriate use of firewalls, SSL encryption, limiting storage of financial information to a PCI compliant third party provider, system redundancies, and co-location at a 24/7 secured, controlled environment.

### Choice/Opt-out

Whenever visitors or users submit requests for more information or services from us, they may opt out of entering certain fields. However, such decision may affect the ability to use portions of the Site and the Services. If you receive marketing or similar e-mail messages from us and wish to opt out of receiving such messages, then you may simply follow the opt-out procedure specified in such e-mail.

### Updating Contact Information

We encourage our visitors and users to update and edit their contact information and keep it current. Users can easily correct or update their contact information at any time through the Service.

### Notice of Changes

Pantheon reserves the right to change this Privacy Statement. Pantheon will provide notification of the material changes to this Privacy Statement through the Company's Web site at least thirty (30) business days prior to the change taking effect. If we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect visitor or user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on the Site or in the Services notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice, we will also email users who have opted to receive communications from us notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
