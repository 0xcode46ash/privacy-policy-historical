# SnapApp Privacy Policy | SnapApp

Last Updated October 20, 2015

Your privacy is important to SnapApp, Inc. (SnapApp). This Privacy Policy applies to the SnapApp website and software platform. Information collection, use and protection of personally identifiable information, including but not limited to name, gender, postal address, email address, phone, and birthdate ("PII") and the choices you have concerning PII are described in this policy. By using the SnapApp website and software platform you consent to the practices described in this policy. SnapApp is located at 55 Chapel Street, Suite 10, Newton, MA 02458.

Via our software platform, SnapApp provides technology and services to our customers that enable them to engage with end users through the creation and deployment of Applications. If we collect information (including PII) of our customers through our Applications, this Privacy Policy applies to that collection of information. If, on the other hand, our customers collect information from their end users through our Applications, this Privacy Policy does not apply to that collection of information. This is because SnapApp has no direct relationship with our customers' end users, and does not control our customers' collection and/or use of the end users' information. To learn how a SnapApp customer (the data controller) uses the information it collects in this way, please see that customer's privacy policy. To access data controlled by our customers please contact them directly.

We regularly review our compliance with this Policy. SnapApp may edit this Policy from time to time and in the event the policy is revised we will notify you of any significant change. Please direct any questions or concerns regarding this Policy via email to [theprivacygroup@snapapp.com](mailto:theprivacygroup@snapapp.com).

**I. Collected Information**

Registration Information: Registration is required to create SnapApp applications or purchase the SnapApp service. You will be asked for PII as part of the registration process. SnapApp requires that account holders be eighteen (18) years of age or older.

Marketing Information: In addition we collect information at our site and through SnapApp Applications that we use for marketing to current and prospective customers. Additional information collected through our use of SnapApp Applications may include responses to questions.

Payment Information: Credit Card and direct debit payments for SnapApp are processed through a third party payment processing provider. SnapApp does not store your personal Credit Card information. For payments requiring an invoice rather than credit card or direct debit, SnapApp will store non-personal billing information, such as name and billing address.

Other Information: In addition to PII, additional information may be collected, such as system information, browser type (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer, Firefox), IP address, the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows or Mac OS), what version of Adobe Flash you are using (e.g., Flash 9.0), CPU type (e.g. Pentium), your manner of connecting to the Internet (e.g., connection speed through narrowband or broadband access), information about your geographic location, and the domain name of your Internet service provider. We also track some of the pages that you visit on our Website through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs). In addition, SnapApp uses third-party service provider partners to employ anonymous cookies for analytical, accounting and data integrity purposes.

Other sources: We may receive information about you from other sources, including publicly available information or information available from third party sources, such as updated delivery and address information from our carriers or third parties, and add it to our account and marketing database information, generally for updating purposes. We may also obtain information about you through optional co-registration and/or advertisements on sites operated by third parties.

Cookies: Our Site uses Cookies, which are pieces of data stored in the browser's memory or written to the user's hard drive that provide the ability to recall information across user sessions. This also enables tracking of various user actions, including across other web sites over time, and helps customize the display of site content. Most web browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. SnapApp sites will not work correctly if cookies are disabled, and some functionality may be completely unavailable. You may reset your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to reject cookies generally. The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable cookies altogether.

Other website related Information: Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of SnapApp. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any Web site you visit. With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. Our Web site may offer publicly accessible message boards, blogs, and community forums. Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through SnapApp public message boards, blogs, or forums, this information may be collected and used by others.

SnapApp's Web site currently does not respond to "do not track" or similar signals.

**II. Use of Collected Information**

In these cases, SnapApp uses only trusted partners who are prohibited from using your information except to provide services for and on behalf of SnapApp and are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

Protection of SnapApp and others: We reserve the right to access, use, preserve or disclose PII: as required by law, regulation, legal process or governmental request and when we believe that access, use, preservation or disclosure is necessary to protect our or our users' rights, property or safety and / or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, legal process or governmental request served upon our company; enforce the terms and conditions of SnapApp, including investigation of potential violations; and to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.

**IV. Access to Information and Preferences/Opt-Out**

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer to desire our service, you may correct, update, and/or request deletion on our site at <https://manage.snapapp.com/profile> or by emailing us at [theprivacygroup@snapapp.com](mailto:theprivacygroup@snapapp.com). If you request that your user information be deleted from our records, there may be a brief delay in our processing that request, while we verify that the request is valid and originates from you as opposed to an unauthorized third party. If you request that your information be deleted, we reserve the right to terminate and/or limit your access to the SnapApp website and services.

To the extent we use PII to email you about our products and services, our email practices are in compliance with the U.S. laws. We also provide you the opportunity to opt out of having your PII used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information.

We offer an opportunity to opt out of certain communications at <http://info.snapapp.com/UnsubscribePage.html>. If you do opt out from receiving promotional communications from us, this does not prohibit us from sharing PII for non-marketing purposes listed above.

**V. Security**

No method of safeguarding information is 100% secure. SnapApp uses a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your PII from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. SnapApp maintains the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When sensitive personal information is collected on our site and/or transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
