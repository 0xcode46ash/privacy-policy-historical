The following statements provide additional details about our privacy commitment.

**General Information and Disclosure of Information Received from Internet Users** (non-clients).  
We gather information about our Internet visitors collectively, tracking such things as pages visited, number of searches performed, keywords used in searches, etc. We only use this information anonymously and in the aggregate. This information allows us to create a better overall experience for you by gauging the level of traffic, speed, and overall performance of our Web site. We may share this information, in the aggregate, with our vendors and advertisers to help them better understand our Web site and the services we offer. When we do this, no information is released that would specifically identify you.

**User Specific Information for Patriot Software, Inc. Clients And Their Employees**  
Patriot Software only requires the Client to provide information that our software needs to perform the tasks it was designed to complete and so that we may provide the services we are obliged to perform pursuant to our Client Services Agreement with the Client. We will require specific information of the Client, which may include the Company’s legal and D.B.A. names, contact information, Federal Employer Identification Number, and banking information so that we may collect our fees. We may also require the Client to provide information about its employees, including name, Social Security number, federal and state tax withholding information, and banking information for direct deposit of paychecks.

**Who does Patriot Software share my information with?**  
Patriot Software will not share a Client's or its employees' information with any third parties who do not have a legitimate business need to know and/or have not been authorized to receive the information. No information about Clients or their employees will be "cross-shared" with any other Patriot Software Clients.

**How does Patriot Software keep my information private?**  
Patriot Software’s software resides on a secure server that encrypts the Client’s and its employees’ information using Secure Socket Layers. The Client can verify that our server is secure by looking for the "s" after "http" in the address line in the browser (example: https://www.PatriotSoftware.com). You may also notice a padlock icon somewhere in your browser. Different browsers display this in different ways. Patriot Software Clients can only access their own company information and information pertaining to their own employees. We safeguard all data submitted with both physical and electronic security measures.
