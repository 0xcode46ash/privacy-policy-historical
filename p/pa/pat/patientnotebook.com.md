# Patient Notebook

The privacy of your personal health information is paramount. This privacy policy describes how ZirMed Inc. (variously, “ZirMed”, we, our or us) protects and handle the personal information that you or your physician provides and that we obtain through our web-based service at [https://www.patientnotebook.com](https://www.patientnotebook.com/) and related web sites (“Patient Notebook”). 

### 1\. Introduction

Patient Notebook is bringing together the latest technology and medical information to make managing your healthcare expenses and information much easier. With Patient Notebook, you can: (1) store and manage all types of healthcare communications in one central place; (2) pay your medical bills quickly, easily and securely; (3) and access other online health tools.

Each person's information is stored and accessed separately in his or her own Patient Notebook account. 

###  2\. Creating an Account and Records: Collection of Your Personal Information 

You choose whether or not to create an account with Patient Notebook. Accounts are only created in-person at your physician’s office. If you do not choose to create an account, you will only be allowed to send your physician: (a) an address update, (b) update your insurance information, (c) request that your physician’s office call you. 

The first time you sign in to Patient Notebook, you will be asked to update your password. To do so, you must provide personal information, such as your email address, name, and date of birth. 

Your email address will be your username and you will be asked to create a password. We will use the email address you provide to send you an email requesting that you validate your account. 

You can review and update your account information. You can also modify, add, or delete any optional information by signing into your Patient Notebook account and editing your account profile.

An account allows you to manage your health and wellness bills and utilize the tools offered on Patient Notebook. Once you have an account, you can view, store, and pay health bills for yourself and dependents (to the extent you have right).

When you send email or other communications to us, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests, and improve our services. 

### 3\. Account and Record Access and Controls

You are the custodian of any records you create or your physician sends to your account. 

###  4\. How We Use Your Personal Information 

We use personal information collected through Patient Notebook, including health and wellness information, to enable the services provided through Patient Notebook and as described in this privacy statement.

In support of these uses, we may use personal information to: provide you with important information about Patient Notebook, including critical updates and notifications; send you email and/or mobile alerts; modify your Patient Notebook account to better address your health or financial needs; and determine appropriate services relevant to you, your lifestyle and your geographic location. 

We may access and/or disclose your personal information if we believe such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on us; (b) protect and defend our rights or property (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety and welfare of Patient Notebook users or members of the public. Personal information collected on Patient Notebook is currently stored and processed in the United States.

###  5\. How We Use De-identified and Aggregated Information and Statistics 

We may use de-identified or aggregated information gathered from Patient Notebook and related statistics to improve the services provided through Patient Notebook, and for certain research and analysis including clinical medical research.

De-identified information does not include personally identifiable information such as name, email address, or address, but may include gender, height, weight, postal code, and medical information. Aggregated information is information from multiple users that is not associated with any individual user account. 

### 6\. Sharing Records with Testing Providers and Other Providers through Patient Notebook

Throughout Patient Notebook, you might be provided with information about other service providers (such as NoMoreClipboard) that connect with Patient Notebook. You should examine these providers’ individual privacy policies and terms of service prior to using their services because this privacy policy does not apply to the activities of such providers.
