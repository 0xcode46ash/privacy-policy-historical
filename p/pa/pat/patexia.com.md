1\. Notice  
This policy tells you, among other things, what information we gather from you, how we may use or disclose that information and our efforts to protect that information.  
  
Types of Information Collected  
In connection with your use of our site, we ask for and may collect a variety of information from and about you in different ways. For example, when you register to use our site, we ask for and store your name and/or your business's name, address, email address and other identifying contact data. In addition, we may collect additional information about your background, intellectual properties, legal, technology or other business services that you may provide. We may also collect other information you may disclose in any of our online forums, blogs, etc., in the form of comments, questions or answers.  
  
Use of Cookies  
Patexia may use non-identifying "cookies" to provide you with easier site navigation. A cookie is a small amount of data sent to a user's web browser from a web server, which is then stored on the user's hard drive. Patexia's cookies do not generate any personal data, nor do they read any personal data from your computer and are never tied to any personally identifiable information.  
  
Use of Information  
Patexia uses your personal data to register you as a user of the site and to facilitate transactions for intellectual property or other services between different users. We will use your e-mail address in order to convey information between users although your e-mail address and other personal information will only be made visible and available to users at your discretion.  
  
We may aggregate your information, and information about your preferences and activities, with those of all or a particular group of users to obtain some statistics about users’ activities. For example, we may track the number of users who view certain pages, or who use certain features, or we may compile the total dollar amount of sales conducted through our site in a particular geographic region. Such information, and other information we derive from individual users' information, allows us to continue to grow and provide you with quality service through more accurate marketing and advertising of our services.  
  
2\. Unsolicited Messages  
We will not send unsolicited messages to our users who have indicated on their Patexia profile that they do not wish to receive such messages.  
  
Patexia will communicate with users in response to their requests for service or customer support. We will contact you either by phone or by email, according to your preference. We will send you service-related emails if it becomes necessary to do so. For example, if the Patexia Platform will be unavailable for a short period of time due to system maintenance, we may notify you via email.  
  
Patexia may also send you an email in order to notify you of updates to our Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, or other agreements you have with Patexia.  
  
3\. Access  
At any time after you have signed onto our site, you may edit your Patexia profile to request access to information we have collected regarding you or your business or to notify us of changes to such information. Once confirmed, any new item of information will replace the corresponding information previously provided. You also have the ability to terminate your account through your profile page where your personal information will be deleted from our database. However, your previous postings and transactions will still be available to users who can view your posts or to entities who were part of that transaction.  
  
4\. Security  
We use industry-standard encryption methods to transmit your personal data from your computer to our platform across the Internet, and we restrict access to any transactional portions of our site to computers running web browsers that support Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") protocol.  
  
Patexia exercises reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal data. However, transmissions administered by humans cannot be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. Patexia will not be liable for unauthorized disclosure of personal data that occurs through no fault of Patexia LLC, including but not limited to, errors in transmission and any unauthorized acts by Patexia's employees.  
  
In addition, remember that you, as a user of our platform, play an important role in security as well. Your password to access our site, which you select at registration, should never be shared with anyone and should be frequently changed. After you have finished using our site, you should log out and close your browser, so no unauthorized persons can access our site with your name and account information. Remember that any information you voluntarily disclose online in any news, message boards, or forums may be collected and used by others without your permission.  
  
Regardless of the precautions taken by you or by us, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit such information at your own risk.

Patexia may disclose your information if, in its own best judgment, it is required to do so in order to comply with a judicial or governmental subpoena, warrant, or other order, or to a government institution that has asserted its lawful authority to obtain the information.
