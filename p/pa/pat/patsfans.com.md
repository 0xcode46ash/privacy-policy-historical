# PatsFans.com - Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting PatsFans.com. We are fans just like you, and we value our privacy just as much as you do. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the way the information is used. 

**THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

At some areas of the site, you can order products, enter contests, vote in polls, subscribe to services such as online newsletters, e-mail lists, etc, and participate in our messageboard communities. The types of information that may be requested and collected at these pages are: 

Name E-mail Address Address Phone Number Credit Card Information 

We also may collect non-personally identifiable information when you visit our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer) , your I.P. Address, and the address of the website you were referred from. 

We may also request that you participate occasionally in an anonymous survey, requesting just your sex, age, household income, and other information which is used to put together demographics for our advertisers. The survey will not be able to personally identify you, and simply helps us work with advertisers to design a campaign that will fit the needs of those who visit this site. 

There may be other occasions where you can submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a friend's name and e-mail address to send a story, or invite them to our site. We collect this information but only in the event we need to step in to prevent abuse or other misuse of that e-mail tool (e.g. someone e-mailing that story 300 times to one person). 

**HOW WE USE THE INFORMTATION**

We may use the information that you provide for account set up and to fulfill your request for products, programs, and services. We will sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you of when you have won a contest, when changes to your account may be required, or to notify you in the event of any major changes in policy or services offered here at the site. 

The non-personal information we collect is used to monitor traffic and also allows us to improve our site to better fit the needs of the fans who use it. 

**COLLECTION OF INFORMATION BY THIRD-PARTY SITES AND SPONSORS**

Some of our pages will contain links to products to affiliate sites, or direct links to the site itself, and their information practices may be different than ours. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices as we have no control over the information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties. 

Google, as a third party vendor and one of our advertising mediums, uses cookies to serve ads on your site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads based on your visit here to and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy. We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx). 

**COOKIES**

To enhance your experience with our site, some of our web pages use "cookies." Cookies are text files that are placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at one of our sites. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. 

We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our site), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our sites. Third parties (usually advertisers) may be also placing and reading cookies on your browser, or using web beacons to collect information, in the course of those ads being served this website. 

Like most standard Web site servers we analyze traffic via log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and similar information. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**LEGAL NOTES**

We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request. 

Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice.
