### Information Collected Automatically 

We may receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Website and/or Path.To Service. Path.To may choose to automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. 

Path.To uses "cookies" to collect non-personal data and information. Cookies are small text files a website uses to recognize repeat users, and is typically placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. The way cookies function is by assigning a number to the user that has no meaning outside of the assigning website.

You should be aware that Path.To cannot control the use of cookies (or the resulting information) by Path.To's third-party partners or advertisers. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of the Website and Path.To Service that depend on cookies.

### Sharing of Personal Information

Except as described in this Privacy Policy, your personal information will be used only by Path.To and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates, and your personal information will not be disclosed to any other third party without your consent. 

Path.To occasionally hires other companies to provide limited administrative and communication services on our behalf, such as hosting websites, the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, or performing statistical analysis of the Services. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only such personal information as necessary for them to deliver the service. Those companies are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information for the above purposes. 

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if Path.To, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Path.To may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

Path.To may access and/or disclose personal information about you or your account without your prior consent if Path.To has a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (i) comply with legal process or other legal requirements of any governmental authority; (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Path.To (including the enforcement of our agreements); (iii) enforce the Terms of Use, which can be accessed at Path.To/terms (v) operate or conduct maintenance and repair of the Services or equipment as authorized by law; or (vi) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Path.To Services or members of the public.

### Security and Protection of Personal Information

We maintain reasonable standards of security and confidentiality and store Personal Information collected in a database. However, while we employ reasonable standards of security, no security system is impenetrable. For most internet sites, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions you submit. As such, Path.To cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won’t be intercepted while being transmitted to Path.To over the internet. We recommend that you do not disclose your password or confirmation number (as applicable) to anyone.

### Advertisements Displayed by Third Parties

Path.To may allow third-party ad serving companies, including ad networks, to display advertisements on the Website. Ad serving companies may place a persistent cookie on your computer in order to recognize your computer each time they display an online advertisement to you, and as such, they may be able to compile information over time about whether you reviewed or clicked on advertisements they display. These companies may use this information to display targeted advertisements and may associate this information with your subsequent visits, purchases or other activities on participating advertisers’ websites. Path.To has no access to or control over cookies of these links to other websites and organizations, nor does Path.To have control over or access to cookies by Path.To’s third-party partners or advertisers.
