# Privacy Policy - Patsnap

PatSnap (“PatSnap”) operates patsnap.com. It is PatSnap's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

Note: Our Privacy Policy (and our Terms of Use) has been derived from the privacy policy of the generous team at Wordpress.com, who have shared their Privacy Policy under a Creative Commons Sharealike license. This text is also shared under a Creative Commons Sharealike license, and we would direct you to the original if you would like to reuse the content you read here.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, PatSnap collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. PatSnap’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how PatSnap’s visitors use its website. From time to time, PatSnap may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

PatSnap also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. PatSnap does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to PatSnap’s websites choose to interact with PatSnap in ways that require PatSnap to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that PatSnap gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Those who engage in transactions with PatSnap – by purchasing access to the PatSnap’s services, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, PatSnap collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with PatSnap. PatSnap does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

PatSnap discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organisations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on PatSnap’s behalf or to provide services available at PatSnap's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organisations may be located outside of your home country; by using PatSnap’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. PatSnap will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organisations, as described above, PatSnap discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when PatSnap believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of PatSnap, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of PatSnap’s website and have supplied your email address, PatSnap may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with PatSnap and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. PatSnap takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorised access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. PatSnap uses cookies to help PatSnap identify and track visitors, their usage of PatSnap website, and their website access preferences. PatSnap visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using PatSnap’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of PatSnap's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, PatSnap may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in PatSnap’s sole discretion. PatSnap encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
