#### Introduction

PAX Labs, Inc. (“PAX Labs,” “us” or “we”) recognizes the importance of protecting your personal information and privacy. This privacy policy addresses how information is collected, stored, and utilized through the [www.PAXvapor.com](https://web.archive.org/) website (“Website”). In continuing to use the Website and/or by purchasing products from this Website, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is to not use our Website.

PAX Labs reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time for any reason. If changes are made to our policies, account holders will receive a notification either via email or upon logging onto their account. For all other visitors to the Website, it is your sole responsibility to check the Privacy Policy Webpage when visiting our Website for any updates.

This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect:

  * Automatically through this Website (e.g., when you click on a link to a different page of the Website); and
  * When you provide it using this Website (e.g., when you make a purchase or contact us through the Website).



This policy applies only to information collected by this Website. It does not apply to information collected by:

  * PAX Labs offline or through any other means, including on any other website operated by PAX Labs or its affiliates; or
  * Any third party, including our affiliates, including through any application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from the Website.



#### Information Collected

PAX Labs holds our customer base in the highest regards and is dedicated to providing the best experience on PAXvapor.com. In order to offer an enjoyable and premium experience on our Website it is necessary to collect both personal information, by which you may be personally identified (e.g., name, address and email), and information that is about you but that does not identify you individually (e.g., aggregate information on the number and frequency of visits to various pages of the Website).

Account creation is required when purchasing products, but we do recommend all visitors create an online account and to opt-in to receiving PAX Labs’ newsletter. With the creation of your account and/or Newsletter subscription we collect your name, date of birth, e-mail address, billing address and shipping address. By providing this information you will save time when ordering products and will receive exclusive offers where legally permitted. If you wish to discontinue ordering products from PAX Labs or no longer receive exclusive offers you may deactivate your account or unsubscribe from our Newsletter at any time.

We also collect information from you when you contact us via the Website, for example, by our “Contact Us” link. In addition we also send your computer a small data file called a cookie. Cookies supply us with information such as your domain name, browser type, operating system, IP address, web pages viewed while visiting our Website, links clicked, length of time spent on our Website, and reference website from which you accessed PAXvapor.com. In gathering this information we are able to enhance your experience when visiting our Website (including keeping your preferences and items placed in your shopping cart between visits). These cookies do not contain or track sensitive information such as your payment information nor do we link this automatically collected information to personally identifiable information you may provide to use directly.

We process online purchases through a third party CyberSource. This third party collects your payment information, including credit card information, to process your payment. When you make a purchase through the Website, PAX Labs does not obtain your credit card information.

You may set your browser to not accept cookies; however, some features of the Website may not function properly without the use of cookies.

We are located in the United States and your data will be transferred, stored and processed outside of the European Economic Area and, in particular, in the United States.

#### Use of Information Collected

PAX Labs utilizes information that is collected in various ways. Information collected helps our efforts to advance our customers’ and visitors’ online experience when visiting PAXvapor.com. This ranges from accessibility, improving content, customer service, shopping checkout experience and overall Website satisfaction. We also use information we collect to process online purchases, to provide you with products or services you request from us, to notify you about changes to our Website, and in any other way we may describe to you when you provide the information.

When signing up for our Newsletter and exclusive offers we will use information gathered to send these communications to you electronically.

We use various third party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform functions on our behalf. It may become necessary to share personally identifiable information with such entities; however, this is only done so when those entities are performing functions solely on our behalf and they are not permitted to store such information except as needed to perform our work or as required by law. Further, we require such third parties to protect your personal information. PAX Labs does not sell, share, or otherwise disclose personally identifiable information about you with third parties.

We may share automatically collected data that does not identify individual users with third parties.

If PAX Labs is acquired by or merged with another company, all of our assets, including information that has been collected, will be transferred to the new entity. In that event, you would be notified and will have the opportunity to have your data removed.

The products sold on this website are highly regulated by various governing agencies. It may become necessary to share the information that we collect with such agencies to comply with laws, a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal requests.

We also may disclose information that has been collected where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud and/or counterfeit, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, violations of our Terms & Conditions or Privacy Policy, or as evidence in litigation in which PAX Labs is involved.

#### Age Verification

The products that we sell on our website are regulated and age-restricted. We are required and committed to preventing sales to anyone under the legal purchasing age. We will only send you marketing materials and information after you have certified that 1) you are a consumer of legal purchasing age; 2) that you wish to be added to our mailing list for the purpose of receiving offers and advertising from us; and 3) that you understand that providing false information may constitute a violation of the law.

Before we add you to our mailing list, we will verify your age through a non-affiliated third party company, Veratad Technologies, LLC (“Veratad”), to perform an age and identify verification check for adherence to this requirement. We utilize Veratad’s AgeMatch and IDMatch Verification services to perform these checks. Veratad uses billons of records from multiple trusted data sources to verify the information that you provide and ensure that you qualify to access and purchase products from PAXvapor.com. This process has been developed with the customer’s privacy in mind, and checks are secure with detailed information neither shared nor accessible.

In some cases Veratad might not be able to verify your age and/or identity through their verification service. If you are unable to verify your age, you will be requested to upload a copy of your government ID that our support team can manually verify your date of birth. Photo IDs are uploaded to Veratad's secure database and all files are deleted within 72 hours or less.

#### Rights with Respect to Your Data

You have the right to access personal data PAX Labs possesses about you. You may request that PAX Labs confirm whether it is processing any data about you and, if so, for what purposes and to which recipients (or categories of recipients) the data is disclosed. You may also request that PAX Labs provide you with the data about you that is being processed by PAX Labs and information as to the source of that data. To request this information, please contact us at [legal@pax.com](mailto:legal@pax.com).

PAX Labs reserves the right to provide this information only at reasonable intervals and to the extent it is reasonably practical for PAX Labs to do so.

You may also contact us to request that we correct incorrect data about you or that we block data about you where it is no longer needed for accomplishing the reasons for which it was collected. Please contact us at [legal@pax.com](mailto:legal@pax.com).

#### Third Party Websites

PAX Labs does not control nor does this Privacy Policy or the Terms & Conditions apply to these third party websites. Links should be clicked at your own risk and it is your sole responsibility to review the Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions of any third-party website accessed.

#### Security

Our Website supports the industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption which is applied to all data transmitted so it cannot be read by others. We are dedicated to ensure that the information you share with us is secure. In addition, if you are using a shared computer, we recommend that you log out of your account before ending your browser session.
