**_Privacy and Cookie  Policy_**

Tika Lifestyles Limited takes the privacy and protection of its clients' personal data very seriously. We are also aware of the threats to your security and privacy on the Internet.

By viewing or interacting with this website or with any banner, pop-up, or advertising that appears on it, you are agreeing to all provisions of the Tika Lifestyles Ltd terms of use and the privacy policy.

**Security**

When you subscribe to Tika Lifestyles Ltd, your name and email address will be placed in a database. As with all other personal data, only employees of Tika Lifestyles Limited have access to this data.

For security reasons, if your inquiry is about one of your subscriptions, we may ask you to submit some additional information only to verify your identity. (This will be information that you have already given us.)

However, we can not guarantee 100% that information, during transmission through the internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care; will be absolutely safe from intrusions by others, such as hackers.

We use appropriate security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of data used by our system.

Although, the website assumes no responsibility for damage to computers or software of the visitor or any person the visitor subsequently communicates with from corrupting code or data that is mistakenly passed to the visitor's computer.

**Sharing of personal data**

We will not share your personal data with anyone outside the Tika Lifestyles Ltd group of companies.

Your personal information will only be available to Tika Lifestyles Ltd, and will not be passed to a third party.

We do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any personal information on our email lists.

Only, however if we need to disclose your personal data to agents or contractors of Tika Lifestyles Ltd to enable TLL (Tika Lifestyles Limited) to process transactions or communicate with you. It will be on the basis that they are to keep the information confidential and will not use the information for any other purpose.

For transactions over TLL's website involving particularly sensitive information, such as credit card numbers and accounting information, TLL will employ accepted transmission and storage protocols, such as encryption, to prevent this information from being disclosed.

**Cookie Policy**

If you have permitted your computer to accept cookies, we may use "cookies" to keep, and sometimes track, information about you. Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser or related software from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies track where you travel on our website and what you look at, transact and purchase. They may store the information in your shopping cart, and/or your username and/or password, and we may use them to deliver specific messages to you. A cookie may enable us to relate your use of our website to other information about you, including your personal information. All of these purposes serve to improve and personalise your experience on the website.

**Fraudulent Emails**

Please note that Paul Fraser Collectibles never sends emails asking you to reply with your personal information.

Email fraud is a common tool of identity thieves. An increasingly common fraudulent activity, called "phishing", uses official-looking e-mails to deceive consumers into disclosing their personal information. The e-mail often directs the recipient to a look-alike website of a legitimate business, tricking consumers into believing they are responding to a valid request. Other fraudulent e-mails entice users to make a purchase and are designed primarily to obtain credit card or bank account information. Paul Fraser Collectibles never sends e-mails asking you to reply with your personal information.

**Exceptions**

If we are required to do so by court order, by the government or law enforcement authorities or if it becomes necessary to protect the rights or property of TLL, we will disclose your personal data.

**Contact**

At any time, you may send an email to _[info@paulfrasercollectibles.com](mailto:info@paulfrasercollectibles.com)_   and request your email address be removed from our lists.

If you have any queries in relation to the use and protection of your personal data please contact us at _[info@paulfrasercollectibles.com](mailto:info@paulfrasercollectibles.com)_

**Changes to the Privacy Policy**

TLL reserves the right to change or update this Privacy Policy, or any other of our policies or practices, at any time, and will notify users of this Website by posting such changed or updated Privacy Policy on this page.
