### Privacy Policy

Last Updated 5/29/08.

When you place an order or request a catalog through our on-line web site, we ask you to provide information which enables us to fulfill your request. This information may include your name, mailing address, phone number, e-mail address or credit card information (in the case of on-line orders). This information allows us to fulfill your request and to contact you in the event we have questions regarding your request or order. We do not know or collect your name or e-mail address unless you provide it. 

Paula Young does collect aggregate information about the pages which visitors review, including the sequence in which they are visited. We may also collect data volunteered by our visitors and customers, such as survey, demographic or product preference information. This information is used to improve our web site and the overall experience we provide to our customers, and is treated as confidential unless otherwise clearly indicated. 

Customers who request printed catalogs or place orders through our web site should read our policy regarding our catalog mailing list.

**Notification of Change**  
We reserve the right to change this policy at any time. This privacy policy will be kept up-to-date and clearly posted on our Web site.

**From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future**  
We will post the policy changes to our web site to notify you of these changes and we will use for these new purposes only data collected from the time of the policy change forward. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our web site periodically . 

**Catalog Mailing List**  
You may request a copy of our catalog through our Internet site by providing the information required on the catalog request form. We will then send you a copy of our current catalog and add you to our catalog mailing list. 

Periodically, we may make our catalog mailing list available to carefully screened companies we believe offer products or services which may be of interest to our customers. If you would prefer not to have your name shared with such companies, you may instruct us not to make it available by contacting our Customer Service department at **800-472-4017**. If you tell us to do this, we will flag your customer record with a code indicating you do not wish to have your name provided to other companies and we will honor this request without hesitation. However, please note that it may take a number of weeks before any mailings initiated prior to your request are processed and delivered. As a matter of policy, we do not disclose the names of companies to which we have provided names. Nor do we disclose the names of organizations from whom we may have acquired names for our own marketing purposes. 

If you do not wish to receive ANY catalogs from Paula Young, you may also instruct us to remove your name from our catalog mailing list by contacting our Customer Service department at 800-472-4017. 

**Mail Preference Service**   
For your information, the Direct Marketing Association has established a Mail Preference Service for consumers who do not wish to receive unsolicited mailings from companies and organizations with whom they do not have a relationship. By adding your name to this list, companies that subscribe to this service will know not to send unsolicited advertising material to you. Most reputable catalog and direct mail companies use this service in order to avoid spending money for advertising which will not be appreciated. 

You may add your name to this service by writing to the following address: 

> Mail Preference Service   
>  Direct Marketing Association   
>  P.O. Box 9008   
>  Farmingdale, New York 11735-9008 

Please note that by placing your name on the Mail Preference Service list, you are ONLY indicating that you do not wish to receive unsolicited advertising from organizations with which you do not already have a relationship. To remove your name from the list of an organization from which you have placed an order or requested a catalog, you must contact that company individually to express your preference. 

**Security**   
All on-line transactions which require the exchange of credit card information are initiated and completed in a secure environment for the protection of our customers.
