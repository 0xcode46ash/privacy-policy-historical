This includes your need and your right to know what we do with the personal information you share with us. It also guides our policies regarding the management of this data, including how the information is collected, processed, and for what purposes.

We also store the details you provide to us during registration, which are needed to operate the parkrun site/service (eg. to send you your results, for our event teams to identify you when you volunteer etc). We use this data internally, and make copies of it for backup purposes. We will take reasonable technical and organisational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information.
