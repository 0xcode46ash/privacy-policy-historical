# None

Parsimonious may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal data:-

* Your IP address, browser type, referral source, length & frequency of visits and number of page views whilst browsing the site (this is standard data that all websites collect)
* Your email address is recorded if you provide me with it by emailing me or the website support address

Since 2008 I do not accept financial contributions, but even prior to that no personal payment information has ever been collected and stored by me or anyone associated with the site. All past transaction details were kept only by Pay Pal

Parsimonious may from time to time use _cookies_ in some parts of the site to improve and facilitate the function of the website, and for the purposes of collecting poll information on various topics **. Please note the following with regard to cookies on this website:

* Where you opt to vote in an open poll on the website there is NO record of any association between you and your poll choice (only the vote option is recorded, not the IP addresses which made the choice)
* Where cookies exist as part of the website function, their _sole aim_ is to improve your experience of this website by recording your browsing preferences in your web browser so that if you visit in the future, those preferences will be used again.

_** Please note that current version of Parsimonious (5.5 instituted in July 2012) does not use any cookies_

Whilst the networks who buy space on this site to display adverts do use some limited data collection for the purposes of appropriately targetting their adverts I am fully committed to only working with only reputable advert providers who operate in an responsible way. I will drop like a thermonuclear, radioactive potato any network that abuses the privacy of site visitors, regardless of how much they might be contributing to Parsimonious' finances!

Please note that there will always be the possibility of an unauthorized breach of the site's web servers, it is sadly the nature of the internet. Under such circumstances I have no control over how stored data may be used and am not responsible for the consequences, however, I have taken every reasonable precaution to prevent this. Parsimonious no longer keeps email addresses in its database for newsletter subscribers, and the old guest book system was removed including all messages in July 2011. Email addresses for currently open support enquiries are not kept on the site's web servers and are deleted once the enquiry has been marked as resolved.

* If you email the support service with a message requiring a response, I will only use that email address to attempt to contact you on matters relating to the issue you raised. The contents of your message _may_ be shared with other Parsimonious staff members if the query relates to their creations and requires them to contribute towards the answer BUT all staff members are also legally bound to honor the site's privacy policy.
* I will NOT share personal data with ANY 3rd party except in _very exceptional_ circumstances where it is necessary to report details of serious illegal activity being perpetrated by the sender, in which case Iam obliged to pass it on to the relevant authorities (by serious I mean properly serious - not someone stole another creator's meshes or whatever!).
