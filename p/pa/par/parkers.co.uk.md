# parkers used car price guides - terms and conditions

During your visit to the Parker’s Online website, you may be asked to provide personal information about yourself (eg name, address, email address, age etc). This would normally be for the purposes of registering for services like the message board, ‘write your own review’, online-purchasing (eg CarCheck guides) and any surveys or questionnaires we may be running. 

By entering your details in the fields requested, Parker’s Online will be able to provide you with these services. Our services are designed to give you information and guidance in the various aspects of the car buying, owning and selling processes. 

This privacy policy has been adopted by Parker’s Online, a brand of Emap Digital Ltd. It sets out how we will use the personal information provided by you. We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which you give that information and for purposes stated in this policy or for which we receive your consent. We retain the right to modify this privacy statement at any time and you are advised to consult it on a regular basis. 

We will only use your personal information for purposes for which you have consented. In particular we will not sell or rent your personal information to third parties unconnected to the products or services offered on this web-site without first obtaining your consent.

We only collect personal data which you give us voluntarily, however in order to offer you the information, content, offers and services which best meet your needs, we need to know you better. 

This also assists us in analysing the profile of our visitors better, which in turn helps us in our endeavours to improve the quality and quantity of the content, services and products available on our website. Information provided in surveys and questionnaires will be broken down into statistics and used for this purpose. 

According to the Data Protection Act, at any time you have the right to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to have any inaccuracies corrected (there will be a small administrative charge for information requests). Parker’s Online will not disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent. 

In connection with the purposes for which you give us your personal information, we will need to process and store your personal information and may need to transfer it to e.g. our affiliates, data processors and other service providers for processing both inside and outside the European Economic Area. Please note that countries outside the EEA may not have the same level of protection as countries within the EEA, but we always demand that those parties to whom we transfer data adhere to the same security procedures that we follow ourselves.

By submitting your personal information on this web site, you are giving your consent for this processing and those transfers of your personal information, and for any other purposes for which you give us your consent. In the event that we (or any of us) transfer the business which is providing goods or services to you to another supplier, you also agree that as part of the purchase your data may be transferred to the new supplier. 

If you do not agree with this privacy policy you should not submit your personal information on this website.
