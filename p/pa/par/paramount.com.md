# Privacy Policy

**INTRODUCTION**

This web site ("Web Site") is operated by Paramount Digital Entertainment, Inc. ("PDE" or "we" or "us"), an affiliate of Paramount Pictures Corporation ("PPC"). This Privacy Policy only covers information collected at our Web Sites, and does not cover any information collected offline by PDE (unless specifically stated), PPC, their parent or affiliated companies. At PDE, your privacy is important to us. We provide this notice to explain our information collection practices and the choices you have about the way your information is collected and used. Click here for a list of the web sites currently covered by this Privacy Policy. Your use of this Web Site indicates to us that you have read and accept our privacy practices, as outlined in this Privacy Policy. In addition, please review our Terms of Use that governs your use of this Web Site. 

While on our Web Site, you may encounter links to other web sites or online materials. For example, Paramount.com contains links to web sites that may be published and maintained by affiliates and/or related entities of PDE, including PPC, Spelling Television and Big Ticket Television. You may also encounter links from sponsors or partners, which linked web sites may include a reference to PPC or a PPC logo as part of a co-branding agreement. Those other web sites may set their own cookies, collect data, and/or have their own privacy policies that differ from this privacy policy. This Privacy Policy only covers information collected by PDE on this Web Site, and we encourage you to review the privacy policy of any other web site you visit.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any personally identifiable information ("PII") you may disclose publicly in user forums (such as chat rooms, message boards, or similar web pages). PII is information that could reasonably used to identify you personally (such as your name, address, or e-mail address). You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose PII on message boards, chat areas or other user forums, that information can be collected and used by other people to send unsolicited messages and marketing materials. Also, please be aware that certain message boards (and similar user forums) may display IP addresses along with the message poster's name and message. We bear no responsibility for any action or policies of any third parties who collect any information users may disclose in user forums or other public areas of this Web Site.

**WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU DO WE COLLECT?**

Generally, you may browse our Web Site without providing any PII. However, we may ask you to provide PII at various times and places on this Web Site, such as when you register for our services, enter a sweepstakes, subscribe to a newsletter, complete a survey or participate in polls, message groups or chat areas. We may also ask you to provide us with demographic information or information regarding your interests, hobbies or similar information. In some cases, if you chose not to provide us with requested information, you may not be able to access all of this Web Site or participate in all of its features. We may combine the information we collect with information available from other sources, including information received from promotional partners or other third parties. We may also provide you the opportunity to e-mail a friend an article, electronic greeting card or other special feature from our Web Site.

**NOTE TO PARENTS/CHILDREN'S PRIVACY**

Protecting children's privacy is important to us. For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information at our Web Site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our Web Site is targeted to attract anyone under 13. We request that all visitors under 13 to our Web Site not disclose or provide any PII. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with PII, we will delete the child's PII from our records.   
**  
OTHER INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

**Log Data:** When you visit this Web Site, our web servers automatically collect anonymous information that describes how our visitors use and navigate our Web Site, and which includes the number and frequency of visitors to each web page and the length of their stays, as well as the anonymous information automatically sent to us by your web browser, such as browser type, referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting our Web Site, and IP addresses. We also may determine what technology is available through your browser in order to serve you the most appropriate version of a web page. For example, we may determine that you have installed a version of Flash, and we will then send you the appropriate Flash version of the web page rather than an HTML page. 

**IP Addresses:** An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer or network when you are on the Internet. When visitors request pages from our Web Site, our servers log the visitor's IP address. We may collect IP addresses for a variety of internal purposes, such as system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the number of visits to different pages on our Web Site.

**Cookies** : Cookies are information files that our Web Site may place on your computer to provide extended functionality. We may use cookies for a number of purposes, such as tracking usage patterns on the Web Site, measuring the effectiveness of advertising, or limiting multiple responses and registrations when we conduct polls and sweepstakes. We do not store any PII in cookies, and we do not link the cookies to any PII we collect. We will not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent by us to you in a cookie. Advertisers or other third parties that are serving content on some of our pages may set and access their own cookies on your computer. Such third parties' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, which may differ from this one. Such third parties do not have access to our cookies. 

You can, of course, disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser. However, it is possible that some parts of our Web Site will not operate correctly if you disable cookies. You should consult with your browser's provider/manufacturer if you have any questions regarding disabling cookies.

**Web Beacons:** While you are on our Web Site, or while you are otherwise viewing our content, you may encounter Web beacons, which may come from PDE or from third parties, such as advertisers or content providers. A Web beacon, which is sometimes also called a Web bug or "clear gif", is a small graphic image in a Web page, a Web-based document or an e-mail message, which generally allows the party that set the Web beacon to monitor certain information about the viewer of the Web page, Web-based document or e-mail message, and it may allow access to certain cookies. Web beacons are usually invisible to the user, because they are very small (generally 1-by-1 pixel). However, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a Web page, including an advertisement, can act as a Web beacon. Web beacons typically collect the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from, the type of browser requesting the Web beacon, the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to and the time the Web beacon was viewed. Web beacons can also be linked to PII, but PDE does not link information gathered through Web beacons to PII. PDE may use Web beacons to count visitors to our Web pages and we may include Web beacons in HTML-formatted e-mail newsletters in order to count how many newsletters (or particular articles, links, etc.) we sent were actually opened. We aggregate all information we collect through Web beacons and we do not use Web beacons to track any individuals' use of the Web Site. PDE does not have control over Web beacons used by third parties and does not have access to whatever information they may collect.

**HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

We use the PII you provide about yourself to provide the information or content you have requested, to contact you about our programs, products, features or services or for other purposes disclosed at the time of collection. For instance, we may notify you that you have won a sweepstakes, send you an email newsletter or send you information about an upcoming television program or movie. If you e-mail someone else an electronic greeting card or other special feature from our Web Site, we will use the information you provide about someone else to send that person the requested e-mail. If you do not wish to receive information about our programs, products, features or services, you may update your preferences at any time by returning to the registration area of the Web Site or Web Sites for which you registered.

We may send you information from our corporate affiliates, including our parent company, Viacom, Inc. and its subsidiaries. If you do not wish to receive this information, you may opt out of such use at any time by returning to the registration area of the Web Site or Web Sites for which you registered.

We use non-identifying information collected on our Web Site in the aggregate to better understand your use of the Web Site and to enhance your enjoyment and experience. For example, we may use the information to improve the design and content of our Web Site or to analyze the programs and services we offer. We may also share non-identifying aggregate information with third parties. For example, we may tell advertisers how many individuals visit certain areas of our Web Site, or how many men or women receive our newsletter. 

We may share your PII with PPC and outside parties who sponsor sweepstakes or other promotions on our Web Site. However, we will not share your PII with outside parties unless you specifically agree to a governing set of rules that allow such disclosure or otherwise give us permission to do so.

We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. For instance, we may use third parties to host message boards or other user forums, to develop software applications and databases or to send communications on our behalf. Our employees, agents and contractors who have access to PII are required to protect the information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.

We may provide access to your PII when legally required to do so, to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Web Site, to limit our legal liability and protect our rights or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors of this Web Site or the public. In those instances, the information is provided only for that purpose.

PDE may also sell, transfer or otherwise disclose user information, including PII, in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, the sale of substantially all assets, or other fundamental corporate change. 

We will not share your PII in ways unrelated to those described above without providing you with an opportunity to opt out of such use or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.   
**  
HOW TO ACCESS OR CORRECT INFORMATION OR MODIFY YOUR CHOICES**

If you visit our Web Site and volunteer PII, you may visit the registration area of the Web Site where you will have the opportunity to access certain of your PII, to correct errors in such information, and to update your preferences regarding what information you may receive from us. You will be required to enter your user name and password before you will have access to your information. It may take us up to twenty-four hours to process your changes, but we will do so as quickly as we can. You should be aware, however, that it is not always possible to completely remove or modify information in our databases. In addition, please be aware that your ability to opt out from receiving marketing and promotional material does not change our right to contact you regarding your use of our Web Site or changes to our Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, or other policy or terms that affect you or your use of our Web Site.

**AD SERVING**

We use a third-party advertising company to serve ads when you visit our Web Site. This company may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to our and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. We share web site usage information about visitors to our Web Site with this company for the purpose of managing and targeting advertisements and for market research analysis on our Web Site and other web sites. For these purposes, we or our third-party advertising company may note some of the pages you visit on our Web Site through the use of Web beacons. In the course of serving advertisements to our Web Site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer. Our third-party advertiser's use of cookies is subject to its own privacy policy, which may differ from this one. Our third-party advertiser does not have access to our cookies. If you would like more information about the information collection practices of this third-party advertising company and to know your choices about not having this information used by this company, [click here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy). 

**THIRD PARTY CONTENT**

When you are on our Web Site, certain content may be created or hosted by a third party. Such third parties may drop cookies and/or use Web beacons, which may be used to identify some of your preferences or to recognize you if you have previously been to their web site or otherwise had contact with them. We do not control the use of such technology by third parties, the information they collect, or how they use such information. We do not disclose your PII to third parties serving content on this Web Site in connection with the serving of such content.

**DATA SECURITY**

We take physical, electronic and managerial steps to maintain the security and accuracy of PII we collect, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers, as well as electronic security systems and password protections that guard against unauthorized access. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.

**CONSENT TO TRANSFER**

This Web Site is operated in the United States. If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States. By using our Web Site, participating in any of our services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.

**ACCEPTANCE**

By using this Web Site, you accept the policies set forth in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy, like the online medium itself, is subject to change, so visitors are encouraged to review this Privacy Policy from time to time.
