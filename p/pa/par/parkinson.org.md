# Privacy Policy and Disclaimer

**NATIONAL PARKINSON FOUNDATION, INC. PRIVACY POLICY**

National Parkinson Foundation, Inc, thanks you for visiting its Web site. Because we are committed to respecting the privacy of our Web site visitors, this Web site privacy policy statement and safeguarding describes the information we collect from you during your visit to our site, how we may use it, and how we will protect the information which you may opt to provide. 

**Personally Identifiable Information**   
Personally identifiable information includes your name, address, zip code and telephone number, e-mail address or any other information which might reasonably be used to identify you individually. NPF collects personally identifiable information from Web site visitors only when it is voluntarily provided. NPF will not otherwise collect this information from you on our Web site. NPF offers the option of making tax deductible contribution to NPF and with a credit card and will collect the information needed to make such transactions.

At those portions of our Web site where we provide you with the option to input personally identifiable information, we notify you of the uses we intend to make of that information in any given instance. When NPF receives personally identifiable information we may use it for reasonable purposes. For example we may use this information to contact you, via e-mail or regular mail, to provide you with information we believe may be of interest. It may also be used for compiling data and analyses to understand and serve your needs. Data is also compiled to evaluate the use and utility of the services we provide on line. **Personally identifiable information will not be sold, rented or exchanged outside of NPF unless the user is first notified and expressly consents to such transfer.**

**Collective/Aggregate Data**  
NPF Web sites may also collect information from you that is not personally identifiable. For example, we might track information about the date and time visitors access our site, the type of web browser they used, and the Web sites from which they connected to our site. Our Web sites collect this information by depositing certain bits of information called "cookies" in a visitor's computer. This technology does not collect an individual visitor's personally identifiable information, rather this information is collected in an aggregate form. The "cookies" can tell us how and when pages in a Web site were visited and by how many people. This aggregate information will enable us to improve our Web sites to serve and inform you better. It also may allow you to shortcut accesses to point of interest on our Web sites when you reenter our system. Attaching this device to your system has no effect on how it performs.

**Use of Communications Forums**  
the National Parkinson Foundation website has, will, or may contain threaded discussions, chat rooms, list servers and other communications forums. By participating in any of these, users agree to send and receive messages that are both proper and related to the forum topic. The following actions are unacceptable practices:  


  * Defaming, harassing, threatening, or otherwise violating the legal rights of others, including their privacy.

  * Misrepresenting one's person, background, or character; 

  * Posting any defamatory, infringing, obscene, false, or unlawful material; 

  * Selling, advertising, or exchanging any goods or services unless expressly allowed; 

  * Posting any copyrighted material owned by a third party.




The National Parkinson Foundation may alter or remove any messages or postings to our site which we deem inappropriate or offensive.

Also, you agree to use the National Parkinson Foundation website at your own risk. While championing the proper use of such forums, The National Parkinson Foundation cannot guarantee that violations of the above code will not occur.  


**Links To Other Sites**  
As a resource to our visitors NPF may provide links to other Web sites. We try to carefully choose Web sites which we believe are useful and meet our high standards for the accuracy and utility of information. However, because Web site design and content can change so quickly we cannot guarantee the standards of every Web site to which we link. Likewise, we are not responsible for the content of any non NPF site. We also cannot guarantee the privacy policies of these other sites and suggest you check the privacy policies of those sites directly. 

**Choice**  
If you wish to stop receiving any e-mail or other communications from NPF which might be sent to you in the future based on your request for this information or if you have submitted personally identifiable information through a NPF Web site and would like to have that information deleted please notify us and it will be done promptly.

**Accuracy**  
NPF will make every effort to maintain the accuracy and confidentiality of any personal information you supply to us. If you wish to make additions or other corrections to the information you have sent in please transmit it to the National Parkinson Foundation Inc.'s data processing department.

**Security**   
All information transmitted to this NPF Web site is secure to the extent possible using existing technology. Unauthorized third parties should not be able to access it during transmission. We will store the information that you share with us securely and will take appropriate steps to protect it from unauthorized access or disclosure. While no security steps can offer 100 percent protection we utilize state-of-the-art technology and systems to prevent unauthorized access to the information we hold. We will limit access to this information to those NPF personnel with a need to know. We educate our staff about their duty to protect your privacy and provide training regarding the policy described herein.
