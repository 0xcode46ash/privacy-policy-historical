# PartyLite -=- Privacy Policy

Information is collected on this website by PartyLite. PartyLite is committed to protecting your privacy and will use your personal information responsibly. Please read below for detailed information about our privacy policy.

 **Information Collection and Use**

PartyLite is the owner of all information collected at this site. We will not share or rent this personal information with or to anyone else in any way that is different from what is disclosed to you in this policy. We may collect information from several different points on our website.

At certain points in interactive communication with us, you might provide us with personal information such as your name, address, telephone number, and email address. Demographic personal information such as income level, gender, and other personal information of yours may be provided by you on an optional basis.

Personal information which you provide to PartyLite will be used primarily by us for the purposes of enabling a PartyLite Consultant or Leader to contact you for the purposes of you becoming a PartyLite Consultant or PartyLite hostess. PartyLite may also use your personal information to contact you to keep you informed of developments or opportunities in relation to PartyLite, or any of its products or services. If you do not wish to receive this information in the future, please inform us by using the "opt-out" option provided on our communication or by writing to us at the address shown below.

Personal information will be held for no longer than required by law or for the purposes for which it was collected as described in this policy. Personal information which is obsolete will be deleted from PartyLite’s systems.

 **Security**

PartyLite has adopted reasonable technical and organizational security measures to prevent unauthorised or unlawful access to or accidental loss of or destruction of your personal information. Not all personal information collected on this website will be retained. All personal information which is retained is encrypted and all systems linked to the internet are equipped with firewalls and tested regularly to provide a high level of security. 

We may retain your personal information at our local PartyLite office or we may send it to PartyLite’s headquarters in Plymouth Massachusetts, USA, but we will assure the security of your personal information in all of our facilities

 **Cookies and IP Addresses**

A cookie is a piece of information stored in your hard drive containing information about you. PartyLite may place cookies on your hard drive to assist in site navigation and to personalize your experience on the PartyLite site. If you want to disable those cookies, most internet browsers will allow you to delete cookies from your computer hard drive, prevent them from being stored, or signal a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions or "help" screen to learn more about these functions.

We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our website. Your IP address may also be used to gather broad demographic data and to recognize customer traffic patterns and site usage. Your address will not be used with personally identifiable information, but will be used to make our site more appealing and interesting.

 **Children**

We do not intend to collect any personal information from children under the age of eighteen. If a parent or guardian of a child who has provided us with such personal information would like the information deleted from our records, he or she should contact us at the email address or telephone number listed at the bottom of this policy statement. We will then delete the child’s personal information from our files.

 **Sharing Personal Information**

We may share aggregated, not personally identifiable information with our affiliated companies. We may also share your personal information with affiliated companies for the purpose of improving our processing of information and service to you and PartyLite Consultants and Leaders. We may also share your details with our selected PartyLite Consultants and Leaders so that they might contact you to provide information to you. While we may show links to other companies on our website, we will not share personal information with them. 

We may, for the purposes described above, transfer your personal information to the USA and other countries outside the EEA in which our affiliated companies and the recipients described above are located, which countries data privacy laws may not afford the same level of protection for your personal information as laws within the EEA. Please be assured that PartyLite and its affiliated companies will continue to abide by the principles set out in this privacy policy, as well as all applicable laws, in respect of such personal information transferred. PartyLite will preserve the security and confidentiality of personal information and afford such personal information an adequate level of protection within each of the PartyLite affiliates in each of the countries to which personal information is transferred. 

**Links to other Websites**

Any link on PartyLite’s website is available for your convenience only and PartyLite is not affiliated with companies sponsoring such linked websites. Each such website has its own privacy policy which may be very different from PartyLite’s. You should review the privacy policy of each of these sites.

 **Surveys & Contests**

The PartyLite website may request personal information from you via an electronic entry form for purpose of your participation in sweepstakes, contests or surveys. If you choose to provide the personal information requested, we will use that personal information to administer your participation in the relevant sweepstake, contest or survey. We may also use such personal information to advise you of PartyLite’s products.

 **Special Information**

Occasionally, we may send you, based on your preferences, information about PartyLite opportunities or products. If you do not wish to receive this information in the future, please advise us of that by using the “opt-out” option provided on our communication or advise us of that fact in writing at the address shown below.

We will post any changes to our privacy policy on our website when our policy changes. However, your consent to provision of information under the current policy will be assumed to constitute consent to any new policy. By your continued use of this website we will make the assumption that you have consented to providing personal information under this privacy policy.
