      * you are legally capable of entering into binding contracts; and 
      * you are at least 18 years old 
    * After placing an order, you will receive an e-mail from us acknowledging that we have received your order. Please note that this does not mean that your order has been accepted. Your order constitutes an offer to us to buy a Product. All orders are subject to acceptance by us, and we will confirm such acceptance to you by sending you an e-mail that confirms that the Product has been dispatched (“Dispatch Confirmation”). The contract between us (“Contract”) will only be formed when we send you the Dispatch Confirmation

    * The Contract will relate only to those Products whose dispatch we have confirmed in the Dispatch Confirmation. We will not be obliged to supply any other Products which may have been part of your order until the dispatch of such Products has been confirmed in a separate Dispatch Confirmation

    * Orders are subject to the availability of Products. In the event that the Products are or become unavailable, we will notify you by email

    * Orders are subject to the availability of Products. In the event that the Products are or become unavailable, we will notify you by email

      * Any text or bespoke words (the “Text”) that you provide in relation to personalised Products such as personalised banners or personalised cards (“Personalised Products”) will be used by us in the manner and form that we receive the Text from you, including any deliberate or otherwise obvious spelling mistakes. We will not make any alteration to the Text 
      * A 'proof read’ is provided when creating your Personalised Products online to allow you to verify the Text. The ‘proof read’ is intended as a guide only and is displayed in a lower resolution for screen viewing purposes only 
    * If you are contracting as a consumer, you may cancel a Contract at any time within fifteen working days, beginning on the day after you received the Products. In this case, you will receive a full refund of the price paid for the Products in accordance with our refunds policy (set out in clause 9 below)

    * To cancel a Contract, you must inform us in writing. You must also return the Products to us as soon as reasonably practicable, and at your own cost. You have a legal obligation to take reasonable care of the Products while they are in your possession. If you fail to comply with this obligation, we may have a right of action against you for compensation

    * Product prices and delivery charges are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect orders in respect of which we have already sent you a Dispatch Confirmation

    * Our site contains a large number of Products and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the Products listed on our site may be incorrectly priced. We will normally verify prices as part of our dispatch procedures so that, where a Product’s correct price is less than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount when dispatching the Product to you. If a Product’s correct price is higher than the price stated on our site, we will normally, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before dispatching the Product, or reject your order and notify you that we are rejecting it

    * If the pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could have reasonably recognised by you as an error, we do not have to provide the Products to you at the incorrect (lower) price

    * Payment for all Products must be by credit or debit card. We accept payment with VISA, MasterCard, Visa Debit Maestro, Solo, Google Checkout and PayPal accounts.

    * If you return a Product to us: 
      * because you have cancelled the Contract between us within the 15 days cooling-off period (see clause 5.1 above), we will process the refund due to you as soon as possible and, in any case, within 30 days of the day on which you gave us notice of cancellation. In this case, we will refund the price of the Product in full. However, you will be responsible for the cost of returning the item to us 
      * for any other reason (for instance, because you have notified us in accordance with clause 19 that you do not agree to a change in these terms and conditions or in any of our policies, or because you consider that the Product is defective), we will examine the returned Product and will notify you of your refund via e-mail within a reasonable period of time. We will usually process the refund due to you as soon as possible and, in any case, within 30 days of the day we confirmed to you via e-mail that you were entitled to a refund. We will refund the price of a defective Product in full, any applicable delivery charges and any reasonable costs you incur in returning the item to us
