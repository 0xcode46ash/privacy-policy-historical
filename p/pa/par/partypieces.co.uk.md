# Privacy Policy

In common with all online stores Party Pieces collects personal information from you when you shop on our website. We use this information to process your order and to keep you informed with the progress of it.

The personal information we collect amounts to:-

  * Your Name and address and delivery address (if this is different) so we can prepare and deliver your order as you have requested. We will also use your mailing address to very occasionally send you a copy of our 100 page printed catalogue unless you ask us not to. You can do this [here](mailto:sales@partypieces.co.uk?subject=Catalogue%20Mailing%20List%20Removal&body=Please%20tell%20us%20your%20name,%20full%20address%20and%20postcode%20and%20we%20will%20remove%20you%20from%20our%20database) or at time in the future by emailing [sales@partypieces.co.uk.](mailto:sales@partypieces.co.uk)
  * Your email address. This allows us send you an order confirmation and to let you know how and when your order left our premises and how you can trace its progress. We will also use your email address to send you our Newsletter (offers, sales and new or seasonal things at Party Pieces) unless you ask us not to. You can do this [here](mailto:sales@partypieces.co.uk?subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20Emails&body=If%20the%20email%20address%20you%20wish%20to%20unsubscribe%20is%20different%20to%20the%20one%20you%20are%20emailing%20us%20on,%20please%20enter%20it%20below.%20Otherwise%20simply%20click%20Send) at any time or from any one of the newsletter communications we send you.
  * Your phone number in case we need to call (or text) you if we have a query about your order.
  * Your credit card details although we donâ€™t ever receive this information ourselves. These details go directly onto the servers of PayPal or Sagepay (for Mastercard and Visa etc) when you enter them during the checkout process. No credit card or other payment information is ever stored on any of our servers.



Our website uses secure server software which will protect your information at all times. Once captured your personal information (excluding payment card information) is held on our own internal servers where it is regarded as strictly confidential. Customer account information is restricted to those who need to access it for the performance of their job and their access is subject to login and password controls.

Some of your personal data has to be passed to other companies for the purposes of taking payment of your order (eg. card processing companies) and delivering it to you (eg. couriers) but they only receive the information necessary to complete their function. Your postal address would be passed to Royal Mail when we send you a catalogue and your email address to DotMailer for sending you our Newsletter unless you ask us not to do these things. 

### Data Protection

Party Pieces is registered (Reg No:Z6426601) with the Information Commissioners Office. We have appointed an internal Data Protection Officer to take responsibility for the care we take with your personal information and this person can be contacted through any of the usual Party Pieces contact channels.
