# PartnerUp - Privacy Policy

## 

We view the protection of your privacy as an important principle and we take your privacy seriously. It’s a fact that in order to provide the PartnerUp Service to our members, we need to collect information from our members. This policy covers how PartnerUp treats personal information that PartnerUp collects and receives. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your full name, complete mailing address, e-mail address or telephone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.

### Collection and Use of Information by PartnerUp

PartnerUp collects personal information when you signup with PartnerUp, when you visit PartnerUp pages or the pages of certain PartnerUp partners, when you use PartnerUp services or products, and when you enter PartnerUp promotions or sweepstakes. When you signup with PartnerUp, we ask for personal information such as your full name and e-mail address. For some services and products, we may also ask for payment information such as credit card information, your address, and other information to complete financial transactions. Once you signup for the PartnerUp service, you are not anonymous to us.

PartnerUp collects information about your transactions with us and some of our business partners, including information about your use of the PartnerUp Service and other services and products that we offer. PartnerUp receives and records information on our server logs from your web browser, which includes your IP address, cookie information, the page you request, the page you were referred by, information about your computer system, and other information. We also gather information when you use the PartnerUp Service and/or web sites, which includes information about your use of PartnerUp, what areas you visit, and what features you use. PartnerUp may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.

PartnerUp uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the content you see, to customize the advertising you see, fulfill your requests for services and products, operate the PartnerUp Service, contact you, conduct research, improve our services, operate our business, and to provide reporting for internal and external customers, compile and aggregate statistical data, and to fulfill requests made by you (such as in the case of our e-mail to a friend option, which will share your name and e-mail address with the friend you’ve chosen to e-mail).

### Non-Personal Information

Due to the nature of the PartnerUp Service, much of the information that we collect from you, some of which may seem like personal information, is not deemed to be personal information, but rather is public information. Some examples of information that you provide to PartnerUp which is public information are: your Member-id, your business background and experience, your career history and background, your city, your state, and your zip code, your resume, the business roles that you are interested in, messages posted by you to forums, questions posted by you, and any Content posted by you to the PartnerUp Service. We generally associate all public information about you with your Member-id and not your name when presenting this information on the PartnerUp Service and you may communicate with other members through the PartnerUp Service’s double-blind messaging system. Accordingly, other Members will generally not be presented with your name or other personal information unless you provide such information to them. Public information is used to operate the PartnerUp service and by the very nature of the PartnerUp Service, must be public in order for the PartnerUp concept to work and to make the PartnerUp community a valuable resource for all of our Members. Public information is accessible to all PartnerUp Members, and visitors to PartnerUp’s web sites, and is not subject to this privacy policy.

### Children

The PartnerUp web sites are not intended for anyone under 18 years of age. Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18.

### Information Sharing and Disclosure

PartnerUp does not sell, rent, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except when we have your permission, to provide services or products, or under the following circumstances: a) We may disclose personal information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, to defend against legal claims, or to establish or exercise our legal rights; b) We may disclose personal information when we believe it is necessary to share information in order to prevent, investigate, or take action regarding unlawful activities, suspected fraud, or situations where we believe that sharing information may prevent physical or financial harm to any person or entity, violations of PartnerUp’s Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law; c) We may share information with trusted third party contractors who work on behalf of or with PartnerUp under non-disclosure agreements; and d) We may share personal information in connection with a possible acquisition, sale, merger, or divesture of the company or its assets, which may include sharing information during a due diligence process, audit process, or may include the transfer of ownership of PartnerUp and/or some or all of its assets to a third party.

PartnerUp may display targeted advertisements based in whole, or in part, on personal information. In addition, PartnerUp may also display targeted advertisements based on public information about you. An example of this is an advertisement targeted at professionals in the accounting field in a given geographic area. Advertisers, including ad-serving companies, may likely assume that people who view, interact with, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria. It is important to note that PartnerUp does not provide any personal information, such as your name, to the advertiser when you view or interact with a targeted ad.

### Cookies and Web Beacons

PartnerUp may set and access cookies on your computer. In addition, PartnerUp lets other companies that show advertisements on our web site set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies’ use of their cookies is not subject to this privacy policy, as it is subject to their own privacy policies. Advertisers do not have access to PartnerUp’s cookies. PartnerUp may use web beacons, also called single-pixel gifs, to access PartnerUp cookies inside and outside of our network of web sites and in connection with various PartnerUp services and products.

### Security

PartnerUp has physical and electronic security measures in place to protect personal information. Further, we utilize SSL (secure socket layer) encryption technology to encrypt sensitive communications (such as credit card numbers) between you and the PartnerUp computer network. We cannot guarantee that unauthorized or malicious users will not defeat these security measures that we have in place. We cannot warrant the security of any information transmitted to us over the internet and we accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure of personal information.

### Access to and Modification of Your Personal Information

You may review, correct, update, or change your name, contact information, and other information pertaining to your account at any time by logging into the PartnerUp Service and clicking on My Account. We retain all information that we gather about you indefinitely and by modifying or deleting your personal information, it will likely remain in our archived records, even after it has been deleted.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

PartnerUp may update this policy from time to time. If we decide to materially change our Privacy Policy, we will post a notice that we have updated this privacy policy on the home page of our site, notify you via the PartnerUp Messaging System, or send you an e-mail to the e-mail address specified in your PartnerUp account.
