Privacy Policy

Version 1.0 -- June 5, 2001 

The privacy and security of our program participants and their family/guardians is very important to us. This privacy policy discloses what information we collect and how we use it. 

1\. What information we collect and how we use it.

Participant Information   
To participate in our programs you will need to register. If the participant is a child, a parent or guardian will need to register them. To register you will need to provide personal information such as name, address, contact information and specific criteria (e.g., age or gender) that we have established for each program. You will also be asked to provide payment information such as credit/debit card numbers and checking account numbers. You will need to select a unique user name and password to verify your identity for future access. This allows you to access and edit personal information that you have provided. Contact information is used for notification purposes (e.g., to confirm program registration) or when necessary for customer service. Payment information is used only to bill you for programs, products and services that you specifically request. 

Our use of Cookies   
A "cookie" is a small piece of information that many websites use to simplify your online experience. We write this information on your hard drive, and we retrieve it when you visit our site. No one else can read a cookie that we write, and we cannot read cookies from other websites. Our cookies do not contain any personal information they simply identify the computer you are using. When you visit our site, the cookie helps us understand how you navigate from page to page on our site. Cookies help us design our site in a way that is easy to use and comfortable to our members. Your browser allows you to control whether and when websites write cookies to your computer. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser to prevent that. If you do not allow us to use cookies, not all features of our website will work as designed. 

2\. Additional uses of information.

All of the information we collect, both what you tell us and what we collect through the use of cookies, is used to personalize your account, to customize our services and to allow our customer service representatives to contact you when necessary. It is our policy not to release any personally identifying information about you. Information will be released only on an aggregated basis (meaning that the information from many participants is grouped together in a way that does not disclose the personal information of any particular participant). We will use contact information that you provide to send you information about us and promotional material from some of our partners. The only circumstance under which we will disclose personal information about an individual user if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with an applicable law or valid legal process. 

In addition to the disclosures described above, personal information about our users may be provided occasionally to outside auditors, consultants, and others we hire for routine website operations, to help us manage email communications with our members, or for other standard business activities. We disclose information only when appropriate to manage our website or for another specific purpose consistent with our privacy policy. We ask all recipients to agree in writing to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the information, to use it only for an authorized purpose, and to return it or destroy it when they no longer need it. 

3\. General Privacy Information.

4\. Security

We use a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your information. All information we collect is stored in a secure database which is protected by a firewall and hosted in a monitored, high security operating environment that is not accessible by the public. We use secure socket layers (SSL) encryption for all credit card transactions that we process and whenever we transfer registration data. 

5\. Privacy Policy Notice

We protect the privacy of our users. We use and disclose personal information responsibly and appropriately. Users can read this policy through privacy links that are readily available throughout our website. 

This policy statement has a version number and date. If we change the policy, we will also change the version number and date so users can tell that a change has been made. We may make minor changes from time to time as our services change, as our relationship with other partners develops, and as the Internet evolves. If we plan to make a major change in the way in which we collect, use, or disclose personal information, we will notify users and obtain their consent for any significant new activity affecting privacy.
