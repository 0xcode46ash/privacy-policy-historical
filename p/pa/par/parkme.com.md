## Privacy Policy

**Parking In Motion, Inc. (“PIM”)** provides this notice explaining our online information practices and the way your personal information is collected and used. If you do not agree with the practices explained in this policy, do not use the Service, and if necessary, ask that your registration or subscription be cancelled. This policy applies only to information PIM collects from you in connection with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to accept the practices and terms set forth in this Privacy Policy. Capitalized terms not defined in this policy shall have the meaning set forth in the PIM EULA.

  1. **Personally Identifiable Information**



Registration is required to access certain features of the Service. As part of the registration process you may be asked for limited personal and demographic information and may be required to choose a username and password that will be used to gain access to the Service. While most of the information we collect is used internally for site analysis and improvement, some of the demographic information in your registration data is used in compiling reports that we may disclose to our partners as part of our business. However, except as stated in Section 3 below, PIM will never disclose or associate with your site usage any of your personally identifiable information, which consists of the following: name, postal address, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, username.

  1. **Use and Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information**



PIM does not rent or sell to advertisers personally identifiable information, such as your name or e-mail address. PIM may use your personally identifiable information:

  1. To deliver you the Service and send you notices related to the Service, your Account and necessary updates. This includes fulfilling your requests for products and services.
  2. To e-mail you our newsletter, promotions and special offers from us and our partners. You may remove yourself from this list at any time by following the link in the e-mail that we send to you or by unscribing in your Account management area we may make available.
  3. To manage your Account and Account access, provide you with PIM Content and User-Supplied Content, purchase confirmations, support and customer service and to keep track of support and customer service requests.
  4. To determine the technical capabilities of your device and the appropriate content to deliver to you.



PIM may disclose personally identifiable information to its partners in order to provide the Service, resolve service problems and correct errors in the Service (including customer inquiries, billing and credit corrections), to communicate with you about the Service, to provide you with advertising and promotional information in connection with the Service, and to enhance your experience on the Service. However, these companies do not have an independent right to share this information. Due to our contractual obligations with these third parties and the need to share personally identifiable information to deliver and support the Service, we cannot provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of sharing personally identifiable information with these third parties. PIM does not store customers’ credit card information, and all credit card orders and information are transmitted securely for processing.

Your personally identifiable information may be provided to a third party if PIM files for bankruptcy, or there is a transfer of the assets or ownership of PIM. PIM may also disclose personally identifiable information in order to respond to a subpoena, court order or other such request, or to otherwise establish or exercise our rights, or defend against legal claims. PIM may also provide such personally identifiable information order to investigate, prevent and take action regarding fraud or misuse of the Service, to comply with law or in response to a law enforcement agency’s request, to enforce our Privacy Policy and end user agreements, and to protect the rights, property and safety of the Service, Users and others.

PIM, its partners, and each of their contractors and employees may view the content that you upload to the Service in order to provide the Service and otherwise perform the tasks set forth in this Privacy Policy.

Any information that you may reveal in communication with other Users or in other online discussions, opinion boxes, or forums is intentionally open to the public and is not in any way private. You should think carefully before publicly disclosing any personally identifiable information. What you have written may be seen and/or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict.

  1. **Non-Personally identifiable and Aggregate Information**



The non-personally identifiable information that we may gather includes your gender, age, zip code, country or territory of residence, IP address (but see the discussion at the end of this section), the type of browser that you use, the type and nature of the content that you upload to the Service and access from the Service, the comments and communication that you enter into the Service, the links and transactions with us and with third-parties that you enter into via the Service, and other aspects of your use of the Service. PIM uses this information to improve the Service, conduct research, to analyze your and other User’s interest in the areas of the Service, to tailor advertising and content displayed to you and other Users, to inform our suppliers about the use of the Service, and to inform our advertisers about the number of Users that have viewed their advertising. To do this we may combine information that we have about you with information that we obtain from business partners or other companies. We may also release aggregate demographic information about User trends to partners and other third parties, including third-party advertisers on the Service. An example of this type of information would be patterns of use of the Service based on zip code or age group. We also retain aggregated log files of requested content in order to report overall product usage to content partners and to evaluate User trends.

Generally, an IP address changes each time you connect to the Internet (it is a “dynamic” address). Note, however, that if you have a broadband connection, depending on your individual circumstance, it is possible that your IP address that we collect, or even perhaps a cookie we use, may contain information that could be deemed identifiable. This is because with some broadband connections your IP address doesn’t change (it is “static”) and could be associated with your personal computer. 

  1. **Data Security**



PIM uses reasonable precautions to keep user information secure. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. However, due to the open nature of communication through the Internet, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and the Service, and the Service and you, will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. Users of the Service do so at their own risk. PIM cannot guarantee the security of any information that is disclosed online.

  1. **Third Party Websites**



The Service may contain links to other web sites or form part of the offering of those web sites. PIM is not responsible for the privacy policies of these sites. If you provide any information to such third parties different rules regarding the collection and use of your personal information may apply. You should review such third party’s privacy policies concerning any their use of data you provide to them.

  1. **Children**



PIM does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. PIM requests that children under the age of 13 not use the Service nor submit any personal information to the Service. Because PIM does not collect information regarding children under the age of 13, PIM does not knowingly use or distribute personal information regarding children under the age of 13. If PIM obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database.

  1. **Cookies**



The Service may use a technology known as web beacons – sometimes called single-pixel gifs – that allow PIM to collect web log information (such as the date and time you visited the Service, the pages you visited, the website you came from, the type of browser you are using, the type of operating system you are using, and the domain name and address of your Internet service provider.  A web beacon is a graphic on a web page or in an e-mail message designed to track pages viewed or messages opened.  We may also include web beacons in e-mail messages to you in order to determine whether messages have been opened.  PIM uses cookies to automate log-in, permit guest access, and record user preferences. A cookie is a piece of information that our webserver sends to your computer (actually to your browser file) when you access a website. Then when you come back our site will detect whether you have one of our cookies on your computer. Users may accept or decline the cookie permitting automatic login during registration, or any time thereafter, by updating their user profile. The other cookies will be loaded automatically unless your browser is configured to block them. Consult the documentation or help files for your Web browser for instructions on setting cookie preferences. We feel that the use of cookies enhances the operation of our site, but they are not required. You will be able to use the core features of the Service with cookies blocked.

As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. 

We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may use this information in our marketing and advertising services. 

In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the PIM website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages. 

Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers. 

  1. **Disclosure to Third Parties**



At times we may make certain personal information available to strategic partners that work with us to provide products and services, or that help us market to customers. If you are approved for service, your account will be governed by our and our partner’s respective privacy policies. Personal information will only be shared by us to provide or improve our products, services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. 

  1. **Service Providers**



We share personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever we operate. 

  1. **Others**



It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for us to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. 

We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party. 

  1. **U.S. – EU Safe Harbor Privacy Statement**



For personal information of employees, consumers, healthcare professionals, medical research subjects and investigators, customers, investors, and government officials that PIM receives from the European Economic Area, PIM has committed to handling such personal information in accordance with the Safe Harbor Principles. For more information about the Safe Harbor Principles, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Website at [http://export.gov/safeharbor/](http://export.gov/safeharbor/). 

  1. **Contact, Corrections and Updates**



If you have any questions or comments about this policy or have questions about our privacy practices, or to issue a complaint, contact us at [privacy@parkme.com](mailto:privacy@parkme.com) or at Parking In Motion, Inc, 1334 3rd St. Promenade #208, Santa Monica, CA 90401.

  1. **Reasonable Efforts**



We will use reasonable efforts to comply with this Privacy Policy and will take prompt corrective action when we learn of any failure to comply with our Privacy Policy. We sometimes release beta versions of our products and services, which are further refined before the release of the final version. Because these products and services are still in a test phase, we may not always catch an unintended privacy issue, despite our efforts to do so. As such, we welcome User feedback on any privacy concerns you may have. In light of the above and because of the complex and constantly changing nature of our technology and business, and the security risks associated with using the Internet, PIM does not guarantee error-free performance under this Privacy Policy. TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LAW, PIM SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES RELATING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.

  1. **Modifications of the Privacy Policy**



PIM reserves the rights to modify its Privacy Policy at any time and will notify you by posting an amendment to the Privacy Policy on the Service. If you have established an Account, we will attempt to inform you of any modifications to this Privacy Policy that affect your obligations to PIM or our obligations to you. If you do not agree with any such modifications, your sole remedy is the termination of your Account, which you may request by sending an email to [info@parkme.com](mailto:info@parkme.com). Your continued use of the Service after receiving notice of any modifications indicates your acceptance of the modified Privacy Policy. 

If you have not established an Account, any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective as to you upon PIM posting the new terms and/or upon implementation of the new changes on the Service. You agree to review this Privacy Policy periodically so that you are aware of any modifications. Your continued use of the Service after any modifications indicates your acceptance of the modified Privacy Policy.
