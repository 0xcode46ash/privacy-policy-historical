# Notabli Privacy Policy — Notabli - Where Childhood Lives

_Notabli was designed and built for private, kid-related content, with the option to selectively share individual moments publicly._

### OWNERSHIP OF DATA

You have complete control over the information and content you provide to Notabli. You retain ownership of all intellectual property rights for content you add to Notabli. You can modify, export, or delete any content you have added. You can also delete your entire account at any time - though we’d love for you to stay.

### INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR ACCOUNT

When you create an account we may collect specific personal information, like your name, picture, email address and phone number, as well as non-personally identifying information like gender. We use this information to allow you to use Notabli, and to send you updates and information about our products and services.

### INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

When you link a third-party service, like Facebook, we may collect and store personally identifying information and data that you have provided to that third-party service, and consented to having shared with services like Notabli. We may use this third-party information to help you easily connect with friends and family. In order to backup your content and make it available to those people and networks you choose to share with, we store the content you share on Notabli.

### ANALYTICS AND COOKIES

Like many services, we use analytics and cookies to improve our services. We use third-party tools, like Google Analytics and Flurry, to automatically record information about your browser and device type. We also use cookies, snippets of code that are stored by your browser, to enable us to recognize your browser on return visits and to help us better understand how and when users interact with Notabli services.

### TRANSFER OF DATA

To the best of our ability, this data is transferred over a secure connection and stored redundantly on multiple servers across multiple facilities.

### SHARING OF INFORMATION

We share your content when you give us permission to do so by inviting viewers, making a moment public, or sharing to a third-party service, like Facebook or Twitter. Please keep in mind that once content is shared publicly or to a third-party service, we no longer have any control over who can view the shared content or what information is gathered by other people or services.

### LOCATION INFORMATION

To add more context to your content, you may choose to add your geo-location. Notabli will request access to your location information, and if approved, you can toggle location on or off for individual moments you post.

### CONTACTS AND ADDRESS BOOK

To help you invite family & friends to keep up with your kids, Notabli will request access to your Contacts. We transmit this information securely and it is not stored.

### CHILDREN’S PRIVACY

All content provided to Notabli about children under the age of 13 is provided with parental consent, to comply with The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and because it’s the right thing to do. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

### LEGAL COMPLIANCE

If we are required by law, it may be necessary to provide access to your information and content. This rare circumstance is the only time we will share information or content you have shared, without your explicit permission.

### UPDATES TO THIS POLICY

When we update this document, we will make the newest version available at [notabli.com/privacy](http://notabli.com/privacy) and in the most recent release of our mobile applications.

### FEEDBACK

If you have any questions, please contact us at [hello@notabli.com](mailto:hello@notabli.com)
