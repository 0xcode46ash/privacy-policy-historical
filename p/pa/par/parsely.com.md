# Audience Data and Publishing Analytics | Parse.ly Privacy Policy

Welcome to Parsely, Inc. (“ Parse.ly ,” “ we ,” “ us ,” or “ our ”), the operator of the Parse.ly Dash Service analytics service that allows publishers to track usage and activity on their own website on a non-personal basis and perform analytics related to the tracking (the “ Dash Service ”). We have created this privacy statement (“ Privacy Statement ”) in order to demonstrate our commitment to you (“ you ” or “ your ”), our user, regarding your privacy with respect to information that you submit to Parse.ly through parsely.com (the “Site” as further defined below) or the Dash Service. As a general rule, there are two categories of users of the Site and Dash Service: " Publishers " who are operators or publishers of websites that make the Parse.ly Dash Service available on their website (“ Publisher Sites ”), and " Visitors " who are individual visitors of the Site or a Publisher Site.

Because we gather important information from users of the Site and Publisher Sites, as well as related services provided by Parse.ly (collectively, the “ Services ”), we have established this Privacy Statement as a means to communicate our information collection, use and dissemination practices. In order to access and use the Dash Service, you must agree to our Terms of Service and any other applicable terms. Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Statement will have the meaning ascribed to them in the Terms of Service.

So we are clear on the terminology: “ Personal Information ” means contact information (e.g., your name, address, email address, and/or telephone number) and any other non-public information that is used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual, and any other non-public information that is associated with that information. “ Anonymous Information ” means information that is not used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual.
