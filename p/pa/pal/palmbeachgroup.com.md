**Sensitive Information**

We will never ask you for sensitive information—your credit card number, for example—except when you place an order. At that time, we will provide a secure (SSL, encrypted) connection and require you to submit only the information needed to complete and fulfill your order. Only our authorized employees will have access to this information.

We will not sell or rent this information to anyone, nor share it in any other way, unless required to by a law enforcement agency that takes the proper steps to request it. Please note that “sensitive information” does not include your mailing address.

**Data Use**

We use the information we collect from you to allow you—where applicable—access to the subscriber-only areas of our website, to deliver your subscriptions, and to send you free emails. We also use your data to improve the services we offer you. This may include asking third parties to conduct market research or trials of new features and services, as well as asking them to run promotional campaigns for us. 

We employ other companies to provide services for our customers and to visitors of our website. We may need to share your information with them to provide information, products, services, and customized ads to you. Examples may include analyzing website data, providing marketing assistance, and supplementing the information you provide us in order to provide you with better service. In all cases where we share your information with such agents, we explicitly require the agent to acknowledge and adhere to our privacy and customer data handling policies.
