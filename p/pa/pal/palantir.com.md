Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information
         We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to
us. Here are a couple of ways you can have control over your information:
         •       Tracking Technologies and Advertising. You can set your browser to refuse all
                 or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you
                 disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this site may then be
                 inaccessible or not function properly.
         •       Promotional Offers from the Company. If you do not wish to receive
                 promotional e-mail messages from us, you can opt-out by checking the relevant
                 box located on the Contact Us form on which you submit your information or by
                 sending us an e-mail stating your request to privacy@palantir.com. If we have
                 sent you a promotional e-mail, you may send an email to privacy@palantir.com
                 asking to be omitted from future e-mail distributions.
Data Integrity and Proportionality
         We only collect as much personal information as needed for specific, identified purposes
and we will not use it in any way that is incompatible with the purpose for which it was collected
or authorized by you.
Accessing and Correcting Your Information
         We take reasonable steps to keep your personal information accurate and complete. You
may send us an e-mail at privacy@palantir.com to request access to your personal information
you have provided to us for the purpose of correcting, amending or deleting data that is
inaccurate. We will do our best to respond to your request in a timely manner and grant your
request as required by law.
Security
                                                   3


         We take your security seriously and take reasonable steps to protect and secure your
personal information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. The safety and security of
your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a
password for access to certain parts of our websites, you are responsible for keeping this
password confidential. Please do not share your password with anyone.
         Although we take reasonable security measures to protect your personal information, for
example, by using Secure Socket Layer encryption when you transmit your password, we cannot
guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our websites. The transmission
of information via the internet is not 100% secure and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of
any information you transmit to us. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy
settings or security measures contained on the websites.
Changes to Our Privacy and Security Statement
         We may amend this Privacy and Security Statement from time to time. We encourage
you to revisit this page periodically to read the current version of this statement in effect.
Enforcement
         We use a periodic self-assessment approach to assure compliance with this statement. If
you have any concerns or questions about this statement or if you would like to lodge a
complaint, please contact us and we will investigate and attempt to resolve any complaints
through our internal process. If we are unable to resolve the complaint through our internal
process, you may submit your dispute to JAMS for mediation pursuant to the JAMS International
Mediation Rules, accessible at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-international-rules/.
Safe Harbor Compliance
         We comply with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor
Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and
retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.
