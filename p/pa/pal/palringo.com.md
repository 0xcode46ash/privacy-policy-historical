## Overview

Palringo provides an innovative communications application and thus requires some information from you. In order to ensure the smooth operation of the service we will also automatically collect information about your usage of the service. We collect the information in order to offer the best service possible and we understand the importance of maintaining your personal privacy. The information we collect is held securely and will not be supplied to third parties. 

## Information

We limit the required personal information to those details required to offer an effective service, but give you the opportunity to supply further information that will be useful to us in better adapting the service to your needs. 

  * Personal Information: In addition to email and phone details, when you register you have the option to tell us your gender, age group, country, and your likes/dislikes. We use this information to deliver the service and communicate with you effectively and to learn about our customer base through abstract statistics (e.g. percentage of female users aged 18-22). 
  * Usage History: We collect information on usage of our service including details like number of messages sent, length of connection and usage of the offline messaging facility. This information is important as it allows us to monitor the performance and usage of the system. 
  * Support: If interested, you have the option to submit bug reports, feature requests, and other feedback to our development team. These and similar services in the future may require us to maintain your account name and password. 
  * Email Address: We ask for your email address in order to send you download instructions and to keep you updated of our status. 



## Security

We take many precautions to keep your personal information secure from unauthorized access, such as encrypted transmission between your computer and our servers and internal corporate policies to limit access to systems that store your personal information. In addition, we keep the most sensitive information, such as your Personal Attributes/Interests, encrypted so it can only be accessed when authorised. We will periodically destroy old personal information when it is no longer required. 

## Sharing of your Information

We will not sell, or rent your email address or any of your personal information. Unless we get your explicit approval in advance, we will only share your personal information as we believe is necessary to: 

  * fulfill your requests;
  * enforce our Terms of Service;
  * protect personal safety;
  * comply with laws or respond to legal processes;
  * allow for change of ownership in which case your information still remains protected under this Privacy Policy; or, 
  * allow for advertising audits to validate the size and composition of the viewing audience. 



## Using Your Personal Information in Other Countries

Your country's privacy laws may require your consent before your personal information can be exported to countries with weaker privacy laws. Our Terms of Service requires your consent to this practice, but regardless of where your information is processed, this privacy policy will remain in effect. 

## Access to Your Information

You can access and update most of your personal information through the client software or our web site. If you wish to review and/or correct any other personal information not yet available through the client software, please send a request to [ personalinfo@palringo.com ](mailto:personalinfo@palringo.com)

## Information on Children

Our service is not intended for children under the age of 16.

## Changes to this Policy

Unless you choose not to receive such notifications, we will alert you when any significant changes are made to this privacy policy. We will also place a prominent notice on our web sites. 

## Feedback

If you have any concerns, questions, or ideas on how we can improve the way we deal with your personal information, please let us know by emailing [ personalinfo@palringo.com ](mailto:personalinfo@palringo.com)
