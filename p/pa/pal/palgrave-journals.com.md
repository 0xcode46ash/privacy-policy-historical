# Palgrave: Journals: Privacy

### Privacy policy

Palgrave Macmillan is committed to providing quality information and services to the academic community. In order to do this, we need to know a little about you.

##### What information do we collect?

We collect only the domain name, but not the e-mail address of visitors to our web pages, and any additional information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations. We also collect aggregate and user-specific information on what pages consumers access or visit. The information we collect is used for internal review, to improve the content of our web pages, to notify consumers about updates to our web site, and occasionally used by us to contact consumers for marketing purposes. It is not sold or traded with other organisations for commercial purposes, though occasionally we may send you information on behalf of carefully selected commercial partners.

##### With respect to cookies:

We use cookies to record session information and to track a user's path through our websites. This enables us to better respond to any problems with our service.

##### What about the information requested during registration? 

When registering on the Palgrave Macmillan Journals website we need information from you that identifies you personally. This includes your exact name, postal and e-mail address. We also ask some further, voluntary questions so we can gain a clearer understanding of our users. We use some parts of your personal information (such as your username, password and any print journal subscription numbers) to operate certain functions contained within the Palgrave Macmillan Journals website. We need your e-mail address in order to  confirm your user identity and password.

Persons who supply us with their telephone numbers online may receive telephone contact from Palgrave Macmillan with information regarding orders they have placed online, and may receive telephone contact from us with information regarding new products and services or upcoming events. If you supply us with your postal address online you may receive periodic mailings from Palgrave Macmillan Journals  with information on new products and services or upcoming events. 

##### E-mails from Palgrave Macmillan:

When registering on the Palgrave Macmillan Journals website you will be able to receive: 

  * Table of Contents from any of our journals
  * Occasional New Product Information Alerts - informing you of journal launches, new products, services and new features from Palgrave Macmillan.
  * Occasional Special Offer Alerts - informing you of special promotions, discounted subscriptions and conference packages.
  * Occasional Third Party Alerts - sending you relevant information on behalf of third parties (without selling, exchanging or disclosing your personal information to the third party).



You may opt out of these at the registration stage or any time thereafter by following the instructions at the bottom of the alert, or have this information corrected by login and modification of your account.

##### Purchasing from Palgrave Macmillan

Palgrave Macmillan uses the industry standard, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption, to ensure our online purchasing facility is fully secured for credit card transactions. **

Your privacy is important to us:

We strive to do everything we can to protect the privacy of our users. We do not sell or exchange personally identifiable information with any third parties.

From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our website to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, we recommend that you review this Privacy Statement periodically, as Palgrave Macmillan may update it from time to time.
