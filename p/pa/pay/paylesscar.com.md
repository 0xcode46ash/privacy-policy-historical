# Car Rentals: Payless Car Rental Privacy Statement

You understand that the collection of personal data is necessary to rent a car, enter our sweepstakes or become a member of the Payless Passport Club. We respect your privacy and your right to know how that information is being used. The following represents our privacy policy regarding the collection, handling and distribution of your personal data. 

SECURITY:   
Any personal data received by us through our website is protected and encrypted by Secure Socket Layer (SSL). We have taken what we believe to be reasonable steps to ensure your personal data is accessible only to those whom we designate. 

We collect customer data in two ways: 

**1) While making a reservation at Payless** , the information you send will be kept for our records only. This information will not be shared with any third parties or any other Payless companies. 

**2) When signing up for a Payless promotion or program** , the information you send will only be used for Payless Car Rental promotions, contest, newsletters, and upcoming events/offers. We will never transmit this information to a third party without your express permission. 

However, you may notify us using the “Option Provision” method below, where we will remove all mention of your information from our promotion database. 

There is one exception to the “Option Provision” and data collection policies mentioned above **. If Payless has determined or been advised that you have used our products/services in furtherance of a crime or in any criminal manner, Payless may release all information to law enforcement in an effort to assist in their investigations.   Payless may also use, or release to third parties, your information as a result of any breach of any agreement between you and Payless.  **

We may also collect information about you through use of cookies.  Cookies used on this website are used solely for the use of demographics collection. For example, once you either fill out or cancel our web survey, you will not be prompted again. This is done using cookies; they store the time and date you last visited this website. Our website then checks that time and date and decides whether you should see the pop up or not. Your browser will allow you to block the use of cookies on our website if you wish. 

PERMISSION:   
By accessing this website or by entering into a rental agreement with us, or with our franchisees or affiliates, you are giving us, our franchisees and our affiliates permission to use, transmit and store your personal information. 

OPTION PROVISION:   
If you want us to limit the use of your personal information, please write us at: 

  
Payless Car Rental Systems, Inc.   
Attn: Option Provision

If you select the Option Provision, Payless will not share your personal information with anyone other than our franchisees and affiliates who need that information to provide you a rental car. However, we reserve the right to pass this information to third parties to enforce collection efforts against you as a result of the breach of any agreement with us or our franchisees or affiliates. 

FUTURE POLICY CHANGES   
We reserve the right to make any changes to our Privacy Policy at any time. The changes will be effective upon posting on our website.
