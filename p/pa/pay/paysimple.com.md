PaySimple does not sell, share, or in any other way transmit personally identifiable information (names, address, phone numbers, etc.) submitted by non-registered users to any other persons or companies. 

Although we currently do not have a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us (collectively, “Affiliates”), we may in the future.  You hereby agree that we may share some or all of your personally identifiable information with these Affiliates.  We will require our Affiliates to comply with this Privacy Policy.

We may use your contact information to send you promotional products and information on behalf of our partner companies.   
We may provide your personally identifiable information to third party service providers and referral partners that work on behalf of or with us to provide some of the aspects of our services and to help us communicate with you.  However, these service providers and referral partners do not have any independent right to disclose this information (accept to the same extent we would have a right to disclose that information under this policy).

If our company or our assets are acquired by another company, that company will possess the personally identifiable information collected by us.

These surveys may ask you for contact information and demographic information (like zip code, age or income level). We use this data to tailor your experience at our site, providing you with content that we think you might be interested in -- and to display content according to your preferences. We sometimes use contact data from our surveys to send you information about our company and/or promotional material on behalf of our partners.
