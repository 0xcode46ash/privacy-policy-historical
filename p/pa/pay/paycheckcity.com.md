### **Privacy Statement for PayCheckCity.Com**

Symmetry Software has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: **PayCheckCity.Com**. 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site.  **PayCheckCity.Com** produces a temporary and instant calculation that produces the withholding information you request through the use of session variables.  Once your session has expired, the information you provided is discarded.  We also place a cookie file in your browser that helps us customize your payroll experience by showing you the state you selected in your calculation.  You in turn do not need to reset this value each time you visit our site.  **PayCheckCity.Com** cannot use these cookies to personally identify you in any way.   None of the payroll information used in your calculations is stored on our servers or tracked in any way.  We are in the business of paycheck calculations, not stealth income tracking. 

This site also includes an option to join a free payroll discussion list.  We **do not** share or sell those email addresses with other companies. 

This site also contains links to other sites. **PayCheckCity.Com** is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. Our third-party advertising company also separately places or recognizes a cookie file on your browser in the course of delivering advertisements to this Site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services of interest to you.
