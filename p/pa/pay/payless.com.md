## Is my information secure?

We want your online shopping to be worry-free, so we use SSL (Secure Socket Layers), the most advanced online ordering security system available. All of your personal information, including your credit card number, is encrypted by SSL.

SSL encrypts your order information to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone other than Payless.com®. To check the security of your connection, look for an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your web browser). This and a change in the first characters of the site address from "http" to "https" alert you that SSL is active.

VeriSign® has issued Payless.com® a unique ID, which assures visitors they have reached our authentic site thereby allowing communications to be encrypted for privacy.

> **VeriSign®  
> ** If you are using a Netscape Navigator browser, version 4.05 or earlier, or a Microsoft Internet Explorer browser, version 4.01 or 4.5 for Macintosh, Payless.com® has been notified that the VeriSign® Internet certificates included with these browsers have expired.
> 
> We therefore urge you to upgrade your Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer or America Online software as soon as possible.
> 
> If you don't wish to upgrade now you may still shop Payless.com® but until you upgrade your browser, the secure lock will remain unlocked. Your transactions will continue to be encrypted and secure at Payless.com®.

We endeavor to make every transaction you make at Payless.com® 100% safe. This means that you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of shopping at Payless.com®.

In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.

> **Liability information**  
>  Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50, Payless.com® will cover the entire liability to you, up to the full $50 amount. Payless.com® will only cover this liability if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made at Payless.com® while using the secure server.

Payless.com® does contract with third parties to help us maintain and manage our customer information to enable us to communicate with you our customers. We do not authorize any of those third parties to make any other use of your information.

Web beacons and cookies are used in those email messages and at our web site to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt out" of this email cookies by [clicking here.](http://www.cheetahmail.com/corp/privacy.html)
