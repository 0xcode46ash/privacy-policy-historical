## Is my information secure?

We want your online shopping to be worry-free, so we use SSL (Secure Socket Layers), the most advanced online ordering security system available. All of your personal information, including your credit card number, is encrypted by SSL.

SSL encrypts your order information to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone other than Payless.com®. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active. You can also double-click by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https".

We endeavor to make every transaction you make at Payless.com® 100% safe. This means that you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of shopping at Payless.com®. 

VeriSign® has issued Payless.com® a unique ID, which assures visitors they have reached our authentic site thereby allowing communications to be encrypted for privacy.

> **VeriSign®  
> ** If you are using a Netscape Navigator browser, version 4.05 or earlier, or a Microsoft Internet Explorer browser, version 4.01 or 4.5 for Macintosh, Payless.com® has been notified that the VeriSign® Internet certificates included with these browsers have expired.
> 
> We therefore urge you to upgrade your Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer or America Online software as soon as possible.
> 
> If you don't wish to upgrade now you may still shop Payless.com® but until you upgrade your browser, the secure lock will remain unlocked. Your transactions will continue to be encrypted and secure at Payless.com®.

Liability information - Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50, Payless.com® will cover the entire liability to you, up to the full $50 amount. Payless.com® will only cover this liability if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made at Payless.com® while using the secure server. 

In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.
