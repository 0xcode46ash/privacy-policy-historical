## Privacy Policy

Payless.com® values our customers and we respect your privacy. We do collect customer information in an effort to provide the best shopping experience and to communicate with our customers about our promotions, sweepstakes, contests and products. We limit the information collected to what is needed to conduct business and offer products and services that might be of interest to you.

Your personal information will not be used for any purpose other than those described above, unless required by law or legal process. 

**Children's Privacy  
** Payless.com®® does not knowingly request, solicit or collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Additionally, Payless.com® requires children over the age of 13 to consult with their parent or guardian to gain permission to submit personal information or to place an order at Payless.com®. Payless.com® encourages parents to supervise their children's online activities. There are several prepackaged parent control tools available to provide a child-friendly online environment. These packages can prevent children from disclosing personal information without parental consent. Please consult the "Consumer Protection" page of the Federal Trade Commission's home page at http://www.ftc.gov/ 

**Information Sharing  
** Payless.com® does not sell or rent your name or personal information for use by any outside company or third party. We may use customer information for our own marketing and promotional purposes. 

Payless.com® does contract with third parties to help us maintain and manage our customer information to enable us to communicate with you our customers. We do not authorize any of those third parties to make any other use of your information.

For example, we may partner with other companies to provide products, services, contests or promotions. In some instances, we may cross-reference our customer databases to identify common customers, ensuring our brands are compatible with our customers' expectations. Payless.com® and our business affiliates may use this information to identify future promotional opportunities and to fulfill promotional or contractual obligations.

We also may share aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about you (such as your age, gender and types of products purchased) with our business associates to fulfill our contractual obligations. Except as described above, we do not share, rent or sell any information we collect online to any unaffiliated third party.

## Secure Shopping Guarantee 

We want your online shopping to be worry-free, so we use SSL (Secure Socket Layers), the most advanced online ordering security system available. All of your personal information, including your credit card number, is encrypted by SSL.

SSL encrypts your order information to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone other than Payless.com®. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active. You can also double-click by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https".

We endeavor to make every transaction you make at Payless.com® 100% safe. This means that you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of shopping at Payless.com®. 

VeriSign has issued Payless.com® a unique ID, which assures visitors they have reached our authentic site thereby allowing communications to be encrypted for privacy.

> **VeriSign  
> ** If you are using a Netscape Navigator browser, version 4.05 or earlier, or a Microsoft Internet Explorer browser, version 4.01 or 4.5 for Macintosh, Payless.com® has been notified that the VeriSign Internet certificates included with these browsers have expired.
> 
> We therefore urge you to upgrade your Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer or America Online software as soon as possible. Just click on the appropriate link below to go to download sites where you can find the latest versions of these browsers.
> 
> Select a button to upgrade your browser.
> 
> If you don't wish to upgrade now, click here to continue shopping at Payless.com®. Until you upgrade your browser, the secure lock will remain unlocked, but your transactions will continue to be encrypted and secure at Payless.com®.

Liability information - Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50, Payless.com® will cover the entire liability to you, up to the full $50 amount. Payless.com® will only cover this liability if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made at Payless.com® while using the secure server. 

In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.
