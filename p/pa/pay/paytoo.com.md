**Safeguards and Security**

**Our People:  ** We train our people to protect the privacy and security of your sensitive information.  Violations of privacy are subject to sanctions under our corporate policies and by law in various jurisdictions.

 **Our Technology:** The technology we employ helps us protect your sensitive information from loss or misuse, from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction and from improper use. For example, we provide password protection for certain services offered on this site. For our online web reservation service, we use industry standard SSL encryption and proprietary security methods to protect data transmissions and to provide secure sessions. We will continue to enhance our security procedures as new technology becomes available and standardized. We store your sensitive information in secure operating environments that are not available to the general public. We have taken all necessary safeguards and security measures to protect your privacy. However, you recognize and accept that under the current technology and practice standards, where Paymotech Group sometimes uses technical security programs in conjunction with its services, Paymotech Group, cannot, and in no way whatsoever provides or implies an absolute warranty of security and protection to you.  If you have agreed to be contacted by email, by providing an email address, than you have thus recognized that all unencrypted Internet email messages can be intercepted and read by third parties.  Hyperlinks: Our website may contain ad banners and hyperlinks that can give you access to websites run by third parties. We have no control over the privacy policies of such third party sites, and we strongly recommend that you review the privacy policy of each third party site that you choose to visit. We are not and cannot be responsible for your privacy on third party sites not under our control.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. <http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm>

**Log Files**  
Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to enable our Web-based service. 

**Communications from the Site**  
Special Offers and Updates   
We send all new members a welcoming email to verify username. Established members will occasionally receive information on services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please email [clients@Paytoomobile.com](mailto:clients@paytoomobile.com) to direct you to the respective 'opt' out of such communications. 

**Service Announcements**  
On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature. Users may opt-out of these communications. Please email [clients@paytoomobile.com](mailto:clients@paytoomobile.com) to opt out. 

**Customer Service**  
We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the users wishes. 

**Sharing**  
 **Legal Disclaimer**  
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site. 

**Third Party Intermediaries**  
We use a credit card processing company to process your payments requests. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

**Business Transitions**  
In the event Paytoomobile.com goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via email prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. 

**Links**  
This Web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we Paytoo Mobile  are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

**Security**  
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to user information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every year, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment. 

If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send an email to [clients@Paytoomobile.com](mailto:clients@Paytoomobile.com)

 **Children's Guidelines**

Paytoo Mobile .com does:

  1. NOT collect online contact information without prior parental consent or parental notification, which will include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and participation in the activity. Without prior parental consent, online information will only be used to respond directly to the child's request and will not be used for other purposes without prior parental consent.

**  
Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information**  
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can usually be done at the [member information page] or by emailing our Customer Support at [clients@Paytoomobile .com](mailto:clients@paytoomobile.com). 

**  
Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
