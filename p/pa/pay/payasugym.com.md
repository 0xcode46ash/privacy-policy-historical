**General Introduction**

These terms and conditions govern your use of our website. Please read the terms in full before you use this Website. If you do not accept these terms, please do not use this Website.

A purchase is made at the point an ePass is either redeemed or expires. 

payasUgym acts as Principal and as a disclosed agent for third party suppliers. When payasUgym is acting as a disclosed agent this means is that the contract for the product is between you and the supplier. In most cases this will mean that there are additional terms and conditions governing the contract as each supplier will have terms and conditions relating to that product. Please make sure that you have read these terms and conditions before completing your transaction with us. Where we act as a disclosed agent this will mean that we have no contractual liability to you in respect of that product. However, we may still be liable to you if we have been negligent, we have misrepresented important information or have been in breach of any other relevant law. On the other hand, for other Partners, we act as principal. This means that the contract for the product is between you and us. We will always let you know where we act as principal and where we act as a disclosed agent. At this point a receipt of purchase will be available. On expired ePass Sandcroft Avenue will always be acting as Principal.
