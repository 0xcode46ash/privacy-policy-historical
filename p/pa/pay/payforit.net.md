**California Do Not Track Disclosures** : Certain browsers may offer you the option of providing notice to websites that you do not wish for your online activities to be tracked for preference based advertising purposes (“DNT Notice”). Some browsers are, by default, set to provide a DNT Notice, whether or not that reflects your preference. Providing DNT Notice is often touted as a means to ensure that cookies, web beacons and similar technology are not used for preference based advertising purposes – that is, to restrict the collection of information your online activities for advertising purposes. Since we do not engage in targeted advertising, we do not track your online activity while on our Website for those purposes. _Please refer to http://allaboutdnt.com/ for more information on how we respond when we receive a “do not track” signal or other indicator of a consumer’s choice concerning the collection of personally identifiable information about the consumer’s online activities._

Once we receive the information, your data is protected through a combination of strictly enforced procedures and a secured computer network designed in accordance with best practice guidelines.
