###### Privacy Statement

The privacy of the consumers who use this site is of the utmost importance to us. We respect your privacy and have instituted and enforce policies to ensure that your personal information is handled safely and responsibly. Personal information includes any information that uniquely identifies you as an individual such as name, address, phone number, or email address and any financial information such as credit card and bank account numbers.   


###### Information Collected and its Use

When you visit our site, we automatically capture your browser type, browser version and Internet provider as well as the paths that you take as you moves from page to page. None of this information is retained in such a way as to identify you as an individual. This is for internal statistical reporting only and may be used to improve the content and layout of our website. 

Personal information that you provide voluntarily is collected in order to complete your payment transaction. This may include information such as your name, address, phone number, email address and data associated with your payment method (credit card or bank account information). We also capture the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet. This is retained and used only in the event that there are issues relating to the origin of a payment transaction. 

Your personal information is not sold or shared with anyone for any purpose other than to achieve successful completion of your payment transaction. Identifiable information is shared only with those parties entrusted with the processing of your payment. Please note that this policy does not apply to information we are required to disclose by law, or in cooperation with law enforcement agencies. 

###### Choices regarding entry of personal information

The entry of your personal information is strictly voluntary. However, certain information is required if you choose to complete a payment using this site.   


###### Commitment to Data Security

We are committed to protecting the personal information that we collect. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, an industry standard for transmitting data securely over the Internet, is used to encrypt the information before it is transmitted to us. Once we receive the information, your data is protected through a combination of strictly enforced procedures and a secured computer network designed in accordance with best practice guidelines. Multiple firewalls, multiple layers of data encryption and an Intrusion Detection System are all used to protect your data.   


###### Changes to the policy

This policy may be changed, modified or amended at any time. However, such changes will not include the selling of information or provision to a third party except as required by law. Updates will be posted to this site. You are responsible for revisiting the page to review any updates.
