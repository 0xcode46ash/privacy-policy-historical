**  
****Privacy Policy – Updated February 10, 2009**  
  


PaySchools knows that you care how your information is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will use and share information cautiously and only in accordance with the law. This Notice of Privacy Policy describes what types of information PaySchools gathers, and states the circumstances under which PaySchools will, or will not, share such information. By visiting PaySchools, you are accepting all the practices described in this Notice of Privacy Policy. 

**What Personal Information About Customers Does PaySchools Gather?**

The information we learn from and about customers helps us personalize your shopping experience at PaySchools. Here are the types of information we gather.

_Information You Provide._ We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way, _except bank and credit card information_. We do not save or store bank or credit card information. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to access the full functionality of PaySchools. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, processing your orders, and communicating with you.

_Information We Gather_. We gather and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use "cookies" to obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses PaySchools from a member institution. We also use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to make products available to you if and when they are offered by a participating institution.

**What Are Cookies?**

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as shopping carts, automatic credit of accounts at member institutions, and access to your personal profile.

The "Help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies are necessary to add items to your shopping cart at PaySchools. If you disable your browser from accepting all cookies, or prevent it from accepting cookies from PaySchools, you will not be able to access PaySchools’ full functionality, including the ability to add items to the shopping cart. 

**Does PaySchools Share the Information It Receives?**

We share customer information only as described below.

_Protection of PaySchools and Others_. We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; to enforce or apply our Terms & Conditions of Use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of PaySchools, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Notice of Privacy Policy. 

Furthermore, and with respect to credit card transaction, we do not use, disclose, sell or disseminate any cardholder information obtained in connection with a credit card transaction (including the names, addresses and card account numbers of cardholders) except for the limited purpose of authorizing, completing, and settling card transactions and resolving any chargebacks, retrieval requests, or similar issues involving card transactions.

We share information regarding your purchase with the member institution who is selling the item(s) purchased. 

**How Secure Is Information About Me?**

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. Of course, we transmit your entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing, but your credit card number is not stored by us. 

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign out when finished using a shared computer. Sign out by clicking the "sign out" link on every page.

**Which Information Can I Access?**

PaySchools gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with PaySchools for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.

**What Choices Do I Have?**

As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, and you may disable your browser from receiving cookies. However, withholding information or preventing your computer from receiving cookies may prevent you from successfully using some or all of the PaySchools features.

The "Help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies are required to make purchases through PaySchools.

You can add or update your profile information.

**Children**

PaySchools does **_not_** sell products for purchase by children. We may sell children’s products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may use PaySchools only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. 

**Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions**

If you choose to visit PaySchools, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice of Privacy Policy and our Terms & Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the state of Iowa. If you have any concern about privacy at PaySchools, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. 

Our business changes constantly, and our Notice of Privacy Policy and the Terms & Conditions of Use may change also, with or without notice. You should check our website frequently to review any recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Notice of Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information without notice to and consent of effected customers.
