**_California Do Not Track Disclosures_** : Certain browsers may offer you the option of providing notice to websites that you do not wish for your online activities to be tracked for preference based advertising purposes (“DNT Notice”). Some browsers are, by default, set to provide a DNT Notice, whether or not that reflects your preference. Providing DNT Notice is often touted as a means to ensure that cookies, web beacons and similar technology are not used for preference based advertising purposes – that is, to restrict the collection of information your online activities for advertising purposes. Since we do not engage in targeted advertising, we do not track your online activity while on our Website for those purposes.

**6\. Your California Privacy Rights:**

Residents of the State of California, under certain provisions of the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed certain personally identifiable information, as defined under California law during the preceding year for third party direct marketing purposes.  You are limited to one request per calendar year. In your request, please attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response.  You may request the information in writing at: Payschools, 12835 E. Arapahoe Road, Tower II, Suite 500, Centennial, CO 80112.

**7\. Our Commitment to Security**

** ** We have implemented administrative, technological and physical security measures we consider reasonable and appropriate to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. In particular, our security measures are sufficient to permit schools and school districts to comply with the requirements of and meet any obligations they may have with respect to the federal student privacy law known as FERPA.  We use Digicert, which specializes in providing Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, an industry standard for transmitting data securely over the Internet, to encrypt the information before it is transmitted to us by you. Once we receive the information, your data is protected through a combination of strictly enforced procedures and a secured computer network designed in accordance with best practice guidelines. Multiple firewalls, multiple layers of data encryption and an intrusion detection system are all used to protect your data.  We cannot, however, guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and are not responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personally identifiable information. We recommend that you take steps to protect the privacy and security of your personal and payment information and your activity while using the internet, as well as your account access information.
