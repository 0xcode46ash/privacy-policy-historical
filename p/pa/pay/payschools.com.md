# PaySchools - Online Payment Processing

**  
****Privacy Policy - Updated August 26th, 2005**  
  
  
PaySchools knows that you care how your information is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice explains our privacy policy. By visiting PaySchools, you are accepting all the practices described in this privacy notice. 

**What Personal Information About Customers Does PaySchools Gather?**

The information we learn from customers helps us personalize your shopping experience at PaySchools. Here are the types of information we gather. 

Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way, except bank and credit card information. We do not save or store bank or credit card information. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, processing your orders, and communicating with you.

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses PaySchools from a member institution. We also use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to make products available to you if offered by the participating institution.

**What About Cookies?**

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as shopping carts, automatic credit of accounts at Member Institutions, and access to your personal profile.

The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies are necessary to add items to your shopping cart at PaySchools so we recommend that you leave them turned on. 

**Does PaySchools Share the Information It Receives?**

We share customer information only as described below.

Protection of PaySchools and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of PaySchools, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.

We share information regarding your purchase with the member institution who is selling the item(s) purchased. 

**How Secure Is Information About Me?**

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. Of course, we transmit your entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing, but after that transmission, your credit card number is discarded. 

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign out when finished using a shared computer. Sign out by clicking the "sign out" link on every page.

**Which Information Can I Access?**

PaySchools gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with PaySchools for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.

**What Choices Do I Have?**

As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of PaySchools features.

You can add or update your profile information.

The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies are required to make purchases through PaySchools

**Children**

PaySchools does not sell products for purchase by children. We may sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may use PaySchools only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. 

**Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions**

If you choose to visit PaySchools, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the state of Iowa. If you have any concern about privacy at PaySchools, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. 

Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the Conditions of Use will change also. You should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.
