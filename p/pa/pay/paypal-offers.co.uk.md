PayPal Offers is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it and what options you have if you do not want us to use your information.

## What data do we collect from you?

PayPal Offers (paypal.co.uk/offers) is a web portal that allows you to obtain valuable rewards for shopping online with our partner merchants. Although you can browse and do some preliminary ’window shopping’ on the site, if you want to visit the website of one of our partner merchants and collect rewards, you have to complete a one time registration and log in during subsequent visits. 

We collect the minimum data necessary to identify you as a PayPal member so that we can provide you with cash rewards when you shop at the website of one of our partner merchants. 

The one time registration process is simple. We ask for your PayPal account ID (your email address). That’s all. On subsequent visits to PayPal Offers, you only have to log in using your PayPal account ID.

## How is this data used?

Cash rewards are calculated on the basis of the purchase transactions that you make with our partner merchants. In order to keep track of your purchases on these independent third-party merchant websites which are not controlled by PayPal Offers, we place a ’cookie’ in your web browser that contains the unique text string that was created during registration. This cookie follows you through the entire shopping and purchase cycle until and including the checkout process when you make payment. When we receive information about purchases from our partner merchants, we can identify yours by looking for your unique text string which is saved as part of the purchase transaction data. We can then calculate how much we owe you in cash rewards and can automatically deposit your reward into your PayPal account.

## What other ways is my data used?

We also use aggregate data of all participants in the programme for marketing and research analysis; however, we never include individual customer data in these reports.

## Use of cookies on this site

As stated previously, the PayPal Offers website uses cookies for one purpose only – to keep track of your purchases so that you can benefit from the cash rewards that our partner merchants are offering when you make a purchase on one of their online shopping websites. A cookie is place in your browser that contains a short text string that is unique to you and has absolutely no meaning or relevance to anyone else.  
If you disable the use of cookies in your web browser, you will not be eligible for cash rewards since we won’t be able to identify the purchases that you make with our partner merchants. To obtain more information about cookies [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20090701093014id_/https%3A//www.paypal-offers.co.uk/page.do?page=cookies&currentTab=cookies&type=-1&subtype=-1&mid=-1&store=-1&merchantType=ROP).

## Security through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

An important additional level of security is used at PayPal Offers by using a cryptographic system called SSL that ensures that every time there is a transfer of information back and forth between your browser and our web server and between your browser and one of our third-party merchant sites, that information is encrypted so that no one can ever read it if that information was intercepted by rogue hackers. You can recognize when SSL is in effect by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser.

## Links to other websites

The PayPal Offers website contains links to other websites, which are not covered by our Privacy Policy. All of the websites of our partner merchants have their own privacy policies which abide by the data protection regulations of the United Kingdom and you should make yourself aware of them whenever you enter any of those sites.
