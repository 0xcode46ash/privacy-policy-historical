##  PayDay One Privacy Policy

At PayDay One your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect and how we use that information and applies if you have applied for service with PayDay One, or if you are a current or former customer.

**PROTECTING THE PRIVACY OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION**

We are committed to protecting your privacy and to implementing technology that gives you the most powerful and secure online experience. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to transmit and store information about you. For instance, we use computer virus protection software, firewalls, and the strongest Secure Socket Layer (SSL) for data transmission to ensure that your information is secure. In addition, we are constantly evaluating new advances in security technology and techniques to provide the best possible protection for information about you.

**INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU**

We collect "nonpublic personal information" about you from several sources:

  * Information you provide on your application
  * Transaction and experience information with us
  * Information from a consumer reporting agency
  * Non-personally identifiable information such as URL and TCP/IP information



**HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

The information we collect about you is primarily used to provide services to you and contact you regarding administrative notices. We may also use your information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our agreements with you, including our Terms and Conditions, Application Agreement, Loan Agreement, and this Privacy Policy. Although we may disclose information we collect and retain, its use will be limited to what we reasonably believe is appropriate and necessary to carry on our business and to provide the quality of service you expect and deserve.

**PARTIES TO WHOM WE DISCLOSE**

  * **Information we share with Affiliates:**  
Some of our services are provided using our affiliates, and we share nonpublic personal information with them.
  * **Information we share with Third Parties:**  
We use certain non-affiliated third parties as service providers, and we share nonpublic personal information with them.
  * **Information we share with Financial Institutions:**  
We may disclose information we collect to financial institutions with whom we have a marketing and servicing agreement such as banks and our affiliates.
