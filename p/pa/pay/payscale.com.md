# PayScale - Salary Survey, Salaries, Wages, Compensation Information and Analysis

**Our Privacy Philosophy**

This site is owned and operated by PayScale, Inc. We understand that you value your privacy and take every precaution to ensure that your information is protected. At PayScale, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe. This Privacy Policy covers PayScale's treatment of Personally Identifiable Information that is collected when you are on the PayScale site, and when you use PayScale's services. This policy also covers PayScale's treatment of any Personally Identifiable Information that PayScale's business partners share with PayScale. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that PayScale does not own, or to individuals that PayScale does not employ. 

**Information Collection and Use**

Our primary purpose for collecting Personally Identifiable Information is to provide you with the services and features that best fill your compensation information needs. 

  * Personally Identifiable Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, your name, home address, telephone number, e-mail address, and credit card information such as the credit card number, card verification value, and the billing address. The types and amount of Personally Identifiable Information collected for these activities will vary depending on the activity.
  * Non-personally Identifiable Information means information which cannot be used to identify and individual. This information is gathered through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This Non-personally Identifiable Information collected includes click-throughs, IP addresses, and usage data. This Non-personally Identifiable Information allows us to better tailor our content to site users' needs. 
  * PayScale collects Personally Identifiable Information when you register for a PayScale account, when you use certain PayScale products or services, and when you visit PayScale pages. PayScale may also receive Personally Identifiable Information from our business partners. 
  * When you register with PayScale, the system asks for your email address and password. Subsequently, the system asks for detailed job and compensation information through a job profile survey that is used to generate your personal compensation report. Once you register with PayScale and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. 
  * PayScale automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, PayScale cookie information and the page you requested. 
  * PayScale uses information for four general purposes: (a) to average your compensation information with others in order to generate personalized compensation reports, (b) to customize the content you see, (c) to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and (d) to contact you about special offers and new products. 



**Cookies**

  * PayScale may set and access PayScale.com cookies on your computer.
  * PayScale may from time to time allow other companies that are presenting advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to PayScale's cookies. 



**Web Beacons**

Web beacons, also known as pixel tags and clear GIFs ("web beacons"), are electronic images that allow a website to access cookies and help track marketing campaigns and general usage patterns of visitors to those websites. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information, such as cookie numbers, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page where the Web beacons is placed. No Personally Identifiable Information about you is shared with third parties through the use of Web beacons on PayScale. However, through Web beacons, we may collect general information that will not personally identify you, such as: 

  * Internet browser, operating system, IP address, date of visit, time of visit and path taken through PayScale. 



Internal use of Web beacons: PayScale may use Web beacons internally to count visitors and recognize visitors through cookies. Access to cookies helps PayScale personalize your experience when you visit the Site. 

Email: PayScale may include Web beacons in HTML-formatted email messages that PayScale sends to you. Web beacons in email messages helps PayScale determine your interest in and the effectiveness of such emails. 

External use of Web Beacons: PayScale may also use Web beacons externally. For example, PayScale may report aggregate information about visitors, such as demographic and usage information, to its affiliates and other third parties. PayScale may also include other company's Web beacons within PayScale.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

We are sensitive to your desire to limit advertising in your daily lives and respect your privacy.

  * We provide information we receive from you to trusted businesses, partners, or persons for the purpose of processing Personally Identifiable Information on our behalf for performing our services and other purposes identified above. 
  * PayScale shares Non-personally Identifiable Information in anonymous aggregate form with partners and other trusted businesses. This Non-personally Identifiable Information is used by these third parties to help PayScale improve the website and PayScale service. In addition, this Non-personally Identifiable Information may be used by the third parties to provide targeted marketing messages from the third parties. You will be provided with the ability to opt-out of receiving additional marketing messages from these third parties. 
  * With your consent, we may share Personally Identifiable Information we receive from you with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. 
  * PayScale may also share Personally Identifiable Information about site users with third parties if doing so is appropriate to carry out a user's request or it reasonably believes that doing so is legally required or is in PayScale's interest to protect its property or other legal rights or the rights or property of others. 
  * If PayScale should ever file for bankruptcy or have its assets sold to or merge with another entity, information PayScale receives from you from this web site is a PayScale asset and may be transferred.



**International Visitors and Customers**

This web site is hosted in the United States. If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law please note that you are transferring your personal data to the United States which does not have the same data protection laws as the EU and by providing your personal data you consent to:

  * The use of your personal data for the uses identified above in accordance with this Privacy Policy; and
  * The transfer of your personal data to the United States as indicated above.



**Data Minimums & "Data withheld for Privacy" Message**

  * To protect the privacy and rights of both individuals and companies, PayScale only displays data that is an average or "aggregate" of multiple data points. When viewing a report you may see the message "Data point withheld for privacy." This mask is not removed until there is sufficient data in the system to create an average, thus preventing the identification of Personally Identifiable Information. 



**Your Use of PayScale Information**

  * In order to enable the attribute-matching features of the PayScale system, users running a PayScale Reportâ„¢ receive limited access to questionnaire data in the form of generic peer profiles. While these profiles include data on job, compensation, geographic location, skills, experience, education and demographic information, the intent of the PayScale service is that this information is not traceable to any particular user. Use of the system signifies an understanding of the source of the data and an agreement on the part of the user to both access and share anonymous user data. 



**Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences**

  * PayScale gives you the complete ability to edit your PayScale Account Information and preferences at any time, including whether you want PayScale to contact you about specials and new products. 
  * You may request deletion of your PayScale account by sending an email to [service@payscale.com](http://www.payscale.com/about.asp?pg=contact&sub=us&reason=service&psp=False). (After your account has been deleted, your profile information may possibly remain in our archived records but is not used in ways that are personally identifiable.)



**Security**

  * Your PayScale Account Information is password-protected for your privacy and security. No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. In certain areas PayScale uses industry-standard SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.
  * If PayScale learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using this web site or providing Personally Identifiable Information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of this site. PayScale may post a notice on our web site if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view PayScale's web site. PayScale may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at [service@payscale.com](http://www.payscale.com/about.asp?pg=contact&sub=us&reason=service&psp=False).



**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

  * We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date on the Privacy Policy. For changes to this Privacy Policy that may be materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information you have provided to us, we will attempt to obtain your consent before implementing the change. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the Personally Identifiable Information we collect. Your continued use of this web site constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Statement and any updates.
