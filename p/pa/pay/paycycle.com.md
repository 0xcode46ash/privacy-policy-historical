## What Information PayCycle Collects, and How It Is Used

In order to provide PayCycle's payroll service, PayCycle's web site asks you to provide personally identifiable information about you and your employees. This information includes your name, address, and tax identification number, and your employees' respective names, addresses and social security numbers, as well as amounts of wages and taxes that you pay. PayCycle uses this information to prepare reports on your behalf that comply with laws applicable to employers. These reports include paystubs for your employees and tax forms for federal and state governments. You control whether and when these reports are printed and delivered to third parties. 

PayCycle charges its service fees to your credit card. Accordingly, PayCycle's web site requests your credit card number and expiration date. You must approve each charge to your credit card on PayCycle's web site before the charge will be made. 

If you elect direct deposit of your employees' paychecks, PayCycle requests additional personally identifiable information about you and your employees, such as information about your bank account, your employees' bank accounts, and your mother's maiden name. PayCycle will use this information to transfer payroll funds from you to your employees. PayCycle also will use this and other information collected about you and your employees to verify your respective identities and creditworthiness. 

PayCycle asks you to provide information about how to contact you by telephone, fax and e-mail. We will use this information to remind you when tax payments are due, to provide you with updated information about employment laws, and to service your account in other ways. We may also use this information to contact you about additional products or services that may be of interest to you. You will have an opportunity to "opt out" of such offers in the future, if you so choose, by following the instructions set forth in the offer that we send you. 

If you use our referral service to tell someone else about our service, PayCycle asks you for that person's name and e-mail address. We will send one e-mail to that person describing our web site and service. We will not use that person's name and e-mail address other than to inform that person about our web site and service. 

We use a technology called "cookies" to keep track of who visits our site. A cookie is an element of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it.

In addition to cookies, we collect the following information from all visitors to our site: the name of the domain through which you access the internet; the date and time you access our site; the internet address from which you linked to our site; and the individual address of the computer you used to access our site. We use this information in the aggregate to administer our web site, to help diagnose and trouble shoot potential server malfunctions, and to gather broad demographic information about usage of our web site. 

## How Information May Be Shared, and What Choices You Have

We share may share personally identifiable information about you and your employees with third party vendors, such as credit card processing companies and banks, who help us perform our payroll service. We will require such third parties to use the information only as necessary to provide our payroll service to you. 

We may use or provide third parties with aggregate information about our customers, such as the size of payroll processed or payment history, for statistical, marketing and other purposes. Such aggregate information will not reveal any of your personally identifiable information, such as your contact information. 

We may disclose personally identifiable information to the Internal Revenue Service or other government entities for normal regulatory purposes or as required by law.

## Our Security Procedures

We take great care to design and maintain security procedures that protect your information on-line and off-line. We encrypt information that you send us and protect it with 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. We use firewalls and intrusion-detection devices to prevent unauthorized electronic access to the servers where your information is stored, and we isolate those servers in cages to prevent unauthorized physical access. Our employees may access your information only to help us provide you with our payroll service. We tell all of our employees how important it is to assure that our customers' information is kept confidential and secure. 

When you sign up for our service, you select a User Name and Password to access the PayCycle web site. You can help protect your information by keeping your User Name and Password secret and by changing your Password from time to time.
