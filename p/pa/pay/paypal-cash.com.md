PRIVACY
PRIVACY POLICY OF ITC FINANCIAL LICENSES, INC. AND IH FINANCIAL LICENSES, INC.
ITC Financial Licenses, Inc. and IH Financial Licenses, Inc. (individually and collectively, "we", "us" and
"our") each value the relationship we have with our customers. This Privacy Policy describes the information
we may collect in connection with our various products and services, and how we use, share and safeguard
that information.
Information We May Collect
To provide you with our products and services that you have requested or other products or services we
think might interest you, to process transactions associated with our products and services, to provide you
with customer service related to our products and services, to determine your eligibility for our products or
services, and to fulfill legal and regulatory requirements, we may collect the following types of nonpublic
personal information about you from the following sources:
•    Information we get from you in writing on applications, by telephone, electronically or by any other
     means, such as your name, address, telephone number, social security number, driver's license
     number, passport number, email address, and date of birth.
•    Information about your transactions with us or others, such as the amount of value you have remaining
     on your stored value card or Vanilla Reload Pack, your spending and payment history, and dispute or
     claim requests.
•    Information we receive from government regulatory agencies.
We also collect information through technology to make our websites more interesting and useful to you and
for various purposes related to our business. For instance, when you visit one of our websites, we collect
your IP address. An IP address is associated with the access point through which you enter the Internet, and
is typically controlled by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), company, school or university. Standing alone,
your IP address is not personally identifiable. We may use IP addresses to collect information regarding the
frequency with which our users visit various parts of our sites, and we may combine IP addresses with
personally identifiable information.
Our websites also collect information through a variety of technical methods, including cookies and web
beacons. Cookies are pieces of information that a website sends to your computer while you are viewing the
website. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of websites.
Cookies, web beacons and other technical methods may involve the transmission of information either
directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf.
We may use the information collected through these technical methods for many purposes, including
delivering content, tracking and enhancing our users' experience on our websites. For example, when you
return to one of our websites after logging in, cookies provide information to the site so that the website will
remember who you are. We also may use technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our website,
such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our websites, and third party websites, such


as the frequency with which our users visit other websites. In HTML e-mails that we send our users, we may
use technical methods for a number of purposes, including: to determine whether our users have opened or
forwarded those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails, to customize the display of banner
advertisements and other messages after a guest has closed the e-mail, and to determine whether a guest
has made an inquiry or purchase in response to a particular e-mail. These technical methods may enable us
to collect and use information in a form that is personally identifiable.
Information We May Share
We will not share the information described above with any company or third party except as required or
permitted by law. This means, for example, that we can disclose such information:
•    To third party service providers who work with us or on our behalf to provide products or services to
     you;
•    To third parties that assist us in marketing our products or services, or to other financial institutions with
     whom we have joint marketing agreements.
•    To third parties that process or service a product, service or transaction that you requested or
     authorized;
•    To respond to a subpoena, court order or judicial process; to pursue a sale, merger, or transfer of all or
     a portion of our business; to our regulators and auditors; to protect against or prevent fraud, manage
     risk, or resolve customer disputes; or
•    To a third party to whom you specifically authorize us to share the information.
Our Security Procedures
We permit access to nonpublic personal information about you only to those employees who we think need
to know that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain commercially reasonable
physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard nonpublic
personal information about you. Although we will use reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of
nonpublic personal information about you, no system connected to the Internet can be guaranteed to be
100% secure nor can transmissions made by means of the Internet be made absolutely secure, and we will
have no liability for disclosure of information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third
parties.


Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
We do not knowingly collect names and email addresses from children under 13 as part of our compliance
with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). If we become aware that we have unknowingly
collected personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, we will make reasonable efforts
to delete such information from our database.
