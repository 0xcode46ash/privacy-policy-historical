# Paessler | Privacy Policy

## We are committed to preserve your privacy! 

On our web sites we do not track usage of individual visitors, nor do we store any user information, IP addresses or cookies, aside from those used by standard website logfiles and statistics. 

For advertising results tracking we may set a cookie on your system (if your system accepts cookies) on your first visit only to reread it later once upon a purchase. This cookie is not personalized.

When you order a software from us (usually through our Online Store which is operated by Element 5) we have to store your address and purchase data for 5 years, which is required by German law. Some of this information is also stored for our Update Center to give you the opportunity to get the latest software versions for free at any time. We will not give away this information to any third-party at any time.

When you visit our Software Update Center and enter your email address or PurchaseID, this information is used ONLY to provide you with technical support, upgrade downloads, and upgrade offers or other services. Your email address is required in order to check your license and to send you your Registration IDs and download links. 

All registered users are notified about new versions of the products they have bought on a regular basis. We send our newsletter "PaesslerNews" to all customers that have bought a product and also to everyone opting into our PaesslerNews newsletter. You can at any time ask to be excluded or removed from these mailings and we always provide an unsubscribe link at the end of our newsletters.
