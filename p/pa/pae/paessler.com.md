**About the Company** ****

Paessler Software Solutions (Paessler GmbH) was founded in 1997 with a vision to develop cost effective software that is both powerful AND easy to use.

All our products were initially developed from our own need for a simple and cost effective solution for some particular problem, that we were unable to find a suitable solution for that met our budget. So we programmed software we always wanted to have for ourselves. This ensures that our products deliver power right on target!

We believe that good quality software should make complicated issues easy to understand, and should make processes simpler, easier and more efficient for the user.

Our commitment to deliver great software has clearly been appreciated by the outside world, as today several thousand customers are relying on our products daily.

Our main office is based in Fürth, Bavaria/Germany, but our staff is scattered all over the world in Germany, USA, Finland and Russia.
