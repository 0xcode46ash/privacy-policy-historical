# Privacy Policy - Pazsaz Entertainment Network

  
[](http://commonwealth.riddler.com/Commonwealth/bin/statthru?388786) **Privacy Policy**

**We take your privacy very seriously here at the Pazsaz Entertainent Network. When we ask you questions about who you are we are trying to create a overall statistical view of our userbase to allow us to provide advertisers with the information they require to place advertising on our site. That advertising pays for the site which allows us to keep the site FREE while continually improving it by adding facilities and services. We hope that you will provide us with the fullest details in our survey pages so that we can build up the best possible view of our users. Please answer as many questions as you feel happy with.**

 **The data you do provide will therefore be used under the strictest control; we will NOT give individual answers to questions from third parties or provide people with your email address without your permission. We loathe the use of "SPAM" email and will not sell or provide your email address for such purposes.**

 **On the Internet, all information collected is defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable:**

  *  ** _Anonymous Information:_ Refers to information that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For instance, we may know that ten thousand people visit this Privacy Policy today, but we do not know their names, where they live or their date of birth. Most of the information we collect about our users is Anonymous Information. **
  * **_Personally Identifiable Information:_ Refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are such as your name, email address, or postal address. You voluntarily give some of this information when you fill out a survey on our site or submit a link to us. The choice of how much of your personally identifiable information that you choose to tell us is left completely up to you. **

**

Like you, we at the Pazsaz Entertainment Network have children of our own and are concerned about their safety when they use the Internet. We want you and your family to be safe while visiting our Internet site. That is why, consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent. 

How the information we do collect is used: 

  * We monitor the page views of the users as a whole of our site to determine what our users want and do not want. 
  * We develop summary, but not individual, reports for our advertisers. The people that make it possible for you to use the Pazsaz Entertainment Network for free, our advertisers, need this information to determine how effective their advertising investments are. We never tell our advertisers who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements, in fact we do not know ourselves.



Other companies which place advertising or sell products on our site may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising or content through the use of cookies. Due to the way the Internet technically operates, we cannot control this collection of information. You should contact these advertisers or merchandisers directly if you have any questions about their use of the information they collect.
