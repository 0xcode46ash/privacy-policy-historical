# Privacy - PaidViewpoint

**Policy Effective Date:** March 2011  
**Last Revised:** Feb 2, 2017

This page discloses the privacy policy and practices of the PaidViewPoint.com website (“ **PV** ” or the “ **Website** ”), a website owned and operated by Umongous, Inc. (“ **Umongous** ” " **we** ", " **us** " or " **our** "), a Delaware Corporation, with headquarters in San Francisco, CA. Umongous also owns and operates AYTM.com, a market research website that has Clients (" **Umongous Clients** " or " **Clients** ") who utilize data, such as answers to surveys and other forms of research (“Research”) data obtained from PV Users ( **“You”** , **“Survey Panelist”** , **“User”** or **“Users”** ) as described below. 

  


## What we do:

Umongous is in the market research and opinion research business. Umongous operates PV for the purpose of gaining anonymous opinions, such as your opinions, in order to help its Clients, gain a better understanding of their business, marketing, product development and strategic opportunities. In order to function as a market research business, we collect your demographic traits (see “What Information We Collect” below). We also collect your anonymous self-declared traits (PV calls these **“Traits Surveys”** ) for the purposes of 1) directing specific surveys to you and 2) sharing aggregated, anonymous traits associated with answers chosen by the pool of people who answered a survey. Your answers to the questions in the Trait Surveys are used to determine your various social, psychological, political, psychographic and preference attributes as a member of the PV panel (See below under **"Trait Information"** ). 

We do not share your name or email address with our Clients. It is a violation of Umongous Terms of Use at AYTM.com for a Umongous Client to seek to determine the individual identity of any PV Survey Panelist. 

**Because the survey answers you provide contain a large amount of demographic and other information about you, there is always a possibility that Umongous Clients who receive this information from us, and/or other third parties with whom Umongous Clients share this information, would be able to deduce your identity based on the information provided, for example if you have provided your zip code and live in small or sparsely populated area or if the combination of your demographics and survey answers is very unique.**

**If you decide that you do not wish to answer a Umongous Client survey or an individual question in a Umongous Client survey, you can opt out of proceeding in answering that survey simply by ending your participation in the survey. It will be cleared from your account, typically in a few hours or days. You will not receive payment for an incomplete Umongous Client survey. See "Your access and choices regarding your personal Information" Section below.**

  


## What Information We Collect:

### Information We Collect Directly from You:

  * **Initial Registration Information:** If you wish to become a User of PV, you must begin the registration process by submitting your email address, and a chosen password and an optional promo code. If you do proceed by clicking the “Next” button, you will then be sent an email to complete the double opt-in process. You then can return to PV to continue the registration process. If you choose to register by using a third-party account (such as your Google or Facebook account), please see “Information we receive from third parties” below. 
  

  * **Standard Demographic Information:** To continue the registration you will be asked to provide what we call "Standard Demographic Information": your gender, a User name, your birthdate, your country, state/region, county, zip/postal code, time zone, PayPal email address, level of education, relationship status, parental status, employment status, and chosen career. You have the option to also supply your household income and race/ethnicity. 
  * **Telephone number and PayPal account information:** You must activate your PV account with an automated code via your mobile phone or land line. When you register for an account on PV and sometimes when you cash out, you may be required to call us with your landline or cell phone or send us an SMS to provide PV with a secret validation code presented to you by PV. As a result of this process, we will learn your phone number and will include it in your PV account where you can change it in the future. We also request your PayPal account information so we can make payments which may be due to you. 
  * **Traits Information:** You will receive many short surveys which enable PV to learn more about you. PV calls these “Trait Surveys”. Traits Surveys may seek information about your health and medical conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union memberships, health, psychographic, psychological makeup and sex life, things you have purchased, own or plan to acquire etc. Your answers to Traits Survey questions are only supplied to Umongous Clients in aggregate form from the pool of respondents who answered the Client’s Survey. If you do not wish to answer any particular question(s) in a given Trait Survey, you can click the “Exit” button. You will not be remunerated for a Trait Survey which you do not complete 
  * **Umongous Client Survey Information:** As part of Umongous’ Market Research Business you may occasionally be given an opportunity to participate in a survey created by a Umongous’ Client, or by Umongous itself. We collect and store the responses that you submit to these surveys. **This information may include, if you consent to this, photos of you, video recordings of you and sharing your screen activity.** When a Umongous Client created the survey, and not Umongous itself, it is the Umongous Client who is responsible for the information and questions included in the survey. A Umongous Client survey may ask you to provide personally identifiable information such as your real name, address, phone number, social security number or email address. It is a violation of the Umongous Terms of Service for a Umongous Client to ask you for personally identifiable information. We urge you not to provide this information. If you see a survey containing such questions, please notify us at support [at] paidviewpoint [dot] com.   
If while taking a Client Survey if you decide that you do not wish to answer a question or otherwise complete a survey, you can click the “Exit” button to leave the survey. You will not receive remuneration for Client Surveys which you do not complete.

## How we use your information:

We may use your information to: 

  * **Provide you the services:** We use the information in your answers to the Trait Surveys to determine whether you are carefully reading questions and providing deliberate, consistent and candid answers. This helps us decide whether or not to include you in our Client's surveys. We also include questions to identify certain psychographic characteristics such as interests, activities, personal opinions and possessions. This helps us to better direct surveys by Umongous Clients to you. For example, you might be asked if you own a pickup truck because a Umongous Client either does or does not wish to survey people who own pickup trucks. 
  * **Send you communications related to the Services:**

_Invitations to take a Survey:_ To facilitate your participation in the survey we may send you an email from time to time to invite you to take a survey.

If you elect to be considered for such study, we may contact you, using the contact information we store on our servers so that you can participate. There will be an additional opportunity to opt out of the study at that point.
