Further Information for Citizens of the European Union (EU) 

The EU has adopted a privacy directive substantially regulating the privacy rights of citizens of the countries of the European Union. Jasc therefore provides Citizens of the IU the following information: 

**Jasc is located in the United States. Any information that you provide to Jasc will be transferred out of the EU to the United States. By providing personal information to us, you are consenting to its storage and use as described herein. You may choose to opt-out of providing this information at any time, as described at the bottom of this privacy statement.**

You must provide us with your name, credit card number, expiration date, type, and billing address. You must also provide the address to which the product is to be shipped. If you do not provide the information, then we cannot accept nor fulfill the order. 

**Your credit card type, number and expiration date will be maintained by Jasc only for a period reasonably calculated to assure that Jasc has received payment for its product(s). This information is not maintained in our databases thereafter.**

In addition, an e-mail address and a telephone number would assist us in contacting you should there be a problem with your order. 

Unless you direct to the contrary, any of the personal information you provide with your order will be maintained by Jasc in its product registration database. 

**Product Registration**   
Jasc's use of your personal information provided to us with a product registration is as disclosed above. 

Unless you direct to the contrary, any of the personal information you provide with a product registration will be maintained by Jasc in its product registration database. 

**Use of Information**   
In addition to the general information provided above with respect to how Jasc will use your personal information, you should be aware of the following: 

Jasc will provide your personal information to certain of its technical support subcontractors in the EU. Jasc will attempt to provide the information to the technical support subcontractors Jasc estimates you might call to assure that, should you need technical support, you will be able to receive it. Jasc may provide your information to more than one such subcontractor. In many cases a technical support subcontractor and a distributor may be the same company. 

Your information will only be transferred to authorized distributors or sub-contractors of Jasc Software, Inc., and only as necessary. Jasc will provide your personal information to its distributors located in the EU so that the distributors may notify you of upgrades, updates, and new products. 

Jasc may provide a location in the EU to which you may mail your product registration information. Such product registration address may be with a subcontractor of Jasc. At any time it is legally permissible to transfer that information to Jasc in the United States, Jasc will do so. Jasc may at anytime cause such subcontractor to transfer your personal information to Jasc or a subsidiary of Jasc located in the EU. 

**Security of Information**   
Jasc Software, Inc. will take reasonable precautions to protect your personal information from loss, mis-use, unauthorized access, disclosure, unauthorized alteration, destruction or other malfeasance, as dictated by any current or future agreements which may exist between the United States and the European Union.
