**THE DICLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION BY NEC COMPUTERS INTERNATIONAL**

As a general rule, NEC Computers International undertakes not to divulge any of your personal data, except with your express consent or in very special circumstances, such as those mentioned below. Consult the terms and conditions of use accompanying each of our services for more details on the potential use of your personal data. 

NEC Computers International may have to divulge confidential information in special circumstances, when this is necessary for the identification, questioning or prosecution of any individual liable to harm or have a detrimental impact (whether intentionally or not) on the rights or property of NEC Computers International, on other users of NEC Computers International or on any other person liable to be penalised by such activities. Finally NEC Computers International may also divulge personal data should NEC Computers International be legally bound to do so (in particular once a claim has been registered).

**SECURITY MEASURES  
**  
Only those persons specifically authorized by NEC Computers International have access to your information. For example, NEC Computers International insists that its employees respect very strict orders, especially as regards access to the database used to store and collect personal information data. NEC Computers International undertakes to use its best efforts to ensure an optimal security of its own databases. However despite all the precautions taken by NEC Computers International, NEC Computers International remains submitted to the current technical constraints of the security measures. Thus, although we do everything within our power to protect your personal data, NEC Computers International will not be in a position to ensure or guarantee that the information you send us is secure. You thus transmit it at your own risk.
