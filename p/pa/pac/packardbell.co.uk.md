During the registration procedure and/or at the time of placing an order, we ask you to complete your registration form and/or order form as accurately and as fully as possible. 

For example, if you wish to receive information, you must provide us with your surname, first name, address, postcode/zip code and e-mail address. This information will give you access to several services:

_THE RANGE OF INFORMATION REQUESTED_

When you register and/or place an order, Packard Bell BV requests certain information, such as your name, your e-mail address and other personal details.

Once you have registered, you are no longer an anonymous customer to Packard Bell BV: you will be entitled to a variety of services offered by Packard Bell BV, such as telephone support. In the event of a problem, if you contact Packard Bell BV we retain a copy of the relevant correspondence. Each time any personal information is collected, Packard Bell BV endeavours to include a link to the relevant page of this Charter. 

_THE USE AND DISTRIBUTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION_

Packard Bell BV’s main aim in collecting personal information is to offer you easy access to our telephone support service, privileged access to Packard Bell services and for you to receive gifts chosen by Packard Bell BV to thank you for registering. Only Packard Bell BV and its subcontractors have access to the data that you provide when you register and/or place an order. 

If, when registering, you indicated that you would like to receive offers or information from Packard Bell BV and its partners, we will, from time to time send you information via e-mail on the products and services relevant to you. Only Packard Bell BV will send you these e-mails directly. 

If you do not wish to receive these messages, you simply need to advise us when providing us with your personal information. You may also, at any time, simply amend your account information with Packard Bell BV so as not to receive any further offers or mailshots. Packard Bell BV does not sell or disclose any information provided by its users to any other party. We advise you at the time of collecting or transferring data if your personal information is liable to be disclosed to a third party and you reserve the right to forbid the transmission of this information. In the event of your information being transmitted to a third party, any correction to or deletion of your personal information will be advised to the relevant third party. 

_THE DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION BY Packard Bell BV_

As a general rule, Packard Bell BV undertakes never to disclose any of your personal information, except with your express consent or in exceptional circumstances, such as those specified below.
