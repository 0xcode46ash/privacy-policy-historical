We never sell your customer information to non-affiliated third parties and we never share your customer information with non-affiliated third parties who may wish to market their products to you.

The federal financial privacy law requires us to provide you with this statement, and we welcome the opportunity to share with you the steps we take to ensure the confidentiality and security of your information.

In this Policy statement, Confidential Information means non-public personally identifiable information about a consumer and the consumer's current or former relationship with any of our network Banks.

**PROTECTING YOUR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.**  
We take seriously our obligation to safeguard your Confidential Information. Your information is accessible only to employees who need the information to provide products or services to you.

**USING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION TO SERVE YOU.**  
We gather and use Confidential Information in the course of providing you with financial products and services.

We may partner with other companies under a joint marketing or servicing agreement to offer you expanded products and services, such as securities, credit cards or life insurance. Before we share Confidential Information with any of these companies, we require that they agree in writing to adhere to strict privacy and confidentiality standards to protect your information and limit its use to the business purpose of our agreement with them. California state law provides additional privacy protections for California residents with regard to sharing information with other companies for marketing purposes. A separate Consumer Rights Notice will be provided to California residents regarding their privacy options.

**IDENTITY SECURITY**  
In an effort to protect you and our country, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act ("USA PATRIOT Act") was passed on October 26, 2001. Title III of the Act is applicable to all U.S. financial institutions and addresses money laundering and terrorist financing. The intent of the Act is to starve terrorists of funding for further actions against the United States, thereby helping to protect our country and citizens from further harm. The USA PATRIOT Act requires banks to gather information to ensure that we identify our customers properly and to monitor account activity for possible funding of illegal operations. These procedures are intended to protect banks and their customers from becoming a vehicle for, or a victim of, illegal activities. 

One particular section of the USA PATRIOT Act requires financial institutions to follow minimum account opening standards concerning the identity of the customer. Procedures to ensure compliance with this requirement include; verifying the identity of the customer, maintaining records regarding the name, address and identifying information of the customer; and consulting lists of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations provided to the institution by the Federal Government. 

What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents. Periodically thereafter, we may ask you to provide, or clarify, your identifying information. In addition, our staff members may need to ask you additional questions about certain types of transactions or there might be certain forms you are requested to complete. We apologize for any inconvenience to you, but we assure you, that we take every measure to protect your financial information, while complying with Federal regulations. If you have any questions, please contact your Branch. Thank you for selecting us to serve you and we appreciate your understanding and cooperation.
