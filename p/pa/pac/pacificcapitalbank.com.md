# Pacific Capital Bank

Santa Barbara Bank & Trust, First National Bank of Central California, South Valley National Bank, San Benito Bank, and Pacific Capital Bank are brands of Pacific Capital Bank, N.A. These brands form The Network of Preferred Community Banks (the "Banks"). All of the Banks are bound by this Privacy Policy and share our commitment to safeguarding your financial privacy. 

We are committed to protecting the Confidential Information you entrust to us. We carefully manage that information to provide you with high quality financial products and services, and we never sell or share your information with non-affiliated outside parties. 

The Federal Financial Privacy Law requires us to provide you with this statement, and we welcome the opportunity to share with you the action we take to ensure the confidentiality and security of your information. 

In this Policy statement, Confidential Information means nonpublic personally identifiable information about a consumer and the consumer’s current or former relationship with any of our network Banks. 

**PROTECTING YOUR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.**

We take seriously our obligation to safeguard your Confidential Information. Your information is accessible only to employees who need the information to provide products or services to you. All our employees are bound by a formal Code of Ethics emphasizing their responsibility to maintain the privacy and confidentiality of your information. In addition, we provide training programs to educate our employees about their responsibilities under our Privacy Policy. 

We also maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to ensure the confidentiality of your information. We monitor new technology and upgrade our systems as needed to best protect your information. 

**PROTECTING DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO NON-AFFILLIATED THIRD PARTIES.**

We never sell Confidential Information to others. Except in limited circumstances permitted by law, we will never disclose Confidential Information to non-affiliated, non-financial third parties without securing your prior consent. 

**USING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION TO SERVE YOU.**

We gather and use Confidential Information in the course of providing you with financial products and services. For example, if you maintain a checking account with us, we keep a record of deposits and withdrawals from your account so that we can calculate your account balance, and we use your name and address to send you a monthly account statement. 

**Collecting Information.**

We may gather Confidential Information from the following sources: 

  * Information you provide on applications and through other forms, such as your name, address, social security number, and income. 
  * Information based on your transactions and account experience with us or with other divisions of our Bank (explained below), such as account balances, and payment or overdraft history. 
  * Information from a consumer report, such as your creditworthiness and credit history 



**Sharing Information Within Our Network of Preferred Community Banks.**

We may share Confidential Information with other divisions within our Bank to better provide you with the products and services you may need. All divisions of the Bank are bound by this Privacy Policy and committed to protecting your Confidential Information. 

**Sharing Information With Companies Working for Us.**

We may retain other companies to help us deliver our financial products and services, and we may share Confidential Information with those companies in the course of their work for us. For example, these companies may assist us in processing your transactions, printing checks for your accounts, or mailing account statements. In addition, we may partner with other companies under a joint marketing or servicing agreement to offer you expanded products and services, such as credit cards or life insurance. Before we share Confidential Information with any of these companies, we require that they agree in writing to protect the information and limit its use to the business purpose of our agreement with them. Neither California nor Federal financial privacy laws require your consent for us to share information for this limited purpose. 

**Disclosing Information as Permitted by Law.**

We may also disclose Confidential Information with your consent or as otherwise permitted by law. For example, this may include disclosure to a credit-reporting agency or in response to a subpoena or other legal process. It may also include disclosure to protect against fraud, as part of an audit or examination. 

We do not share Confidential Information about former customers, except as permitted by law. 

**Fiduciary Information.**

When we act as fiduciary or trustee, your fiduciary information is subject to even more stringent limits on information sharing, both within and outside the Bank. Please contact your Personal Trust Officer if you have any questions about the protection of your fiduciary information.
