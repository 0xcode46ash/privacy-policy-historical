We are required to comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 (“ **DPA** ”) in relation to the personal information we hold about you.  Under the DPA, Pace Limited is known as a data controller in respect of the personal information which we collect from you using this Website and to which this Privacy Policy applies. This means that when you provide personal information to us, we have certain responsibilities in relation to that personal information.  Pace Limited has notified the Office of the Information Commissioner of its data processing activities: our registration number is Z5989422.

## **What information do we collect from visitors to the Website and how is it used?**

We may collect personal information from visitors to our Website in different ways.  For example, you may complete one of our online enquiry forms, e-mail an enquiry to us using one of the links which we provide on our Website or you may complete our online registration form to subscribe to our e-mail alerts. 

The exact nature of the personal information which we collect from you will depend on your enquiry.  However, the information we collect will in most cases, include your contact details such as your title, name, company (if relevant) and email address.  In addition, you may also need to provide us with more specific information depending on the nature of your enquiry.  For example, if you would like to subscribe to our news alerts then you will need to provide us with information about the topics you are interested in so that we send appropriate alerts.

If you wish to raise a more general enquiry or have a particular topic which is of interest to you, then you will need to give us sufficient information in order for us to deal with it. Similarly, you might also send information by completing one of our comments fields such as if you complete our Website feedback form or use the technical enquiry form to raise questions. In each case, the additional information which you provide may also contain personal information which will also be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

The information which you provide will be held on our records and used for the proper administration of our business and to deal with the enquiries or requests which you make.  We may also use the information from time to time, for our market research purposes.

We also provide information on our Website on the careers pages about our current vacancies and invite people who are interested in a vacancy at Pace, to complete our online application forms.  Similarly, you may send us your CV on a speculative basis by completing our speculative application form.  We will use the information you provide to consider your application and may also retain your details on our records so that we can consider your details for future positions.  Where you raise a speculative enquiry, you will be required to confirm that you agree to Pace retaining your details for that purpose.

Note also that some of the information which you provide may include what is known as sensitive personal data, such as information about trade union memberships, religious belief or health. Please note that by sending this information to us, you specifically consent to our using that information for the purposes outlined in this Policy _._

## **Other uses of your personal information: Marketing and sharing data**

As well as dealing with your enquiries, we may use your personal information to provide you with marketing information such as details of our promotions, new services and changes to the Website. We will do this in accordance with the marketing preferences which you tell us about on the relevant web pages.

If you decide at any time that you do not wish to receive marketing information, please email us at **[info@pace.com](mailto:info@pace.com "Email us")** with details of your request.  Please note that it may take a short time for us to remove your details from our marketing list so the change may not be made immediately.

Please note that when using your personal information in accordance with this Policy, it may be that we need to make your details available to other members of the Pace group of companies in order to deal with your enquiry.  Please note however that we will not share personal information about you with third parties outside the Pace group except strictly if we have a legitimate need, such as if we are under a legal obligation to do so or as explained in this Policy from time to time.

We do not trade or rent your personal information to third parties.

## **When you submit information to us – your obligations**

When you provide any personal information to us, you warrant that it is accurate and up to date. This is very important because if you provide details which are inaccurate then we may not be able to deal with your enquiry. You should therefore check that all details are accurate and without error.

You should inform us if any information which we hold about you requires updating.  If you would like us to update any personal details which we hold about, then please write to us at Pace Limited, Victoria Road, Saltaire, BD18 3LF, providing details of the change.

If you submit a third party's details to us for any reason, for example, if you wish us to respond to your enquiry by contacting another person, if you raise an enquiry on someone else’s behalf or if you would like someone else to receive our email alerts, you must first have obtained their permission to do so. By providing details about someone else, you confirm that you have all appropriate permissions.  

## **How do you access the personal information we hold about you?**

To obtain a copy of the personal information we hold about you, please write to the Company Secretary at Pace Limited, Victoria Road, Saltaire, BD18 3LF, enclosing a cheque or postal order for £10 made payable to Pace Limited to cover our administration costs. As soon as we are satisfied as to your identity we will send you, within 40 days of receipt of your written request and the fee, a copy of all the personal information we hold about you which we are legally required to disclose to you.
