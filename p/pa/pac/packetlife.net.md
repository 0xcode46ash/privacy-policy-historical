# Privacy Policy - Packet Life

## PacketLife.net Privacy Policy

This site has been designed with respect for users' privacy in mind. This policy discusses the types of information collected from users and the safeguards in place to ensure its confidentiality.

### Logs

HTTP requests made of the site are logged and archived for the purposes of statistical analysis and troubleshooting. Logs contain no more information than your browser sends; this includes your IP address, [user agent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent), requested URL, and the time the request was received.

For illustration, here's what the log entry generated by the request for this page looks like:
    
    
    207.241.237.234 [16/May/2011:02:54:02 +0000] "GET /privacy/ HTTP/1.0" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; archive.org_bot +http://www.archive.org/details/archive.org_bot)"

### Cookies

[Cookies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) are used to track limited user information; primarily, the session ID of a registered user who has logged in with his or her username and password. Other cookies may be assigned by [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) and third-party advertisers. Advertisers rely on cookies for uniquely but anonymously tracking individual users and for geographically targeting their advertisements. PacketLife.net does not present advertisements from companies proven or suspected to be presenting advertisements of a malicious or questionable nature.

You can opt to disable some or all of these cookies in your browser's preferences if you'd like. However, be aware that disabling this site's session ID or [CSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) token cookie will prevent you from logging in to the site as a registered user. You can opt-out from receiving cookies from many ad networks [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

Below are the cookies your browser sent with this request:


### Passwords

Users who register a personal account on the site are required to provide a password of their choosing to be used for authentication. At no point is this password stored in clear text. Passwords are stored in an irreversible salted SHA-1 hash. The site administrators have no practical way of knowing what your password is.

For example, here's what the password **foobar42** might look like stored in the database:
    
    
    sha1$eba27$df1d8e0623af14a3d838081eba58852a58c1a30f

### Administrative Contact

Please [contact the site administrator](https://web.archive.org/contact/) if you still have questions not answered by this policy statement.
