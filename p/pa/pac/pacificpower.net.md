The Company also collects information regarding our interactions and transactions over the course of our business relationship with you. 

When you use Pacific Power's online customer self-service functions, any personal information you enter in fields or forms provided in these services are secured using an industry standard security technology known as Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”). By using SSL, the Company attempts to safeguard the confidentiality of your user name, password and other personal information. For SSL to work, your browser must be capable of supporting SSL.
