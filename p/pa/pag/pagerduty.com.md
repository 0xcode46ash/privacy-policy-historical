## User Consent

By submitting or making available data through our Website or Services as described below, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your data may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of data may be less stringent than the laws in your country.

## (A) What Data We Collect

### Information Provided by Visitors

If you visit our Website, we may collect Personal Data from you, such as first and last name, organization name, e-mail address and password if you decide to register to receive information or schedule a demo. If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail (e.g., in response to an employment opportunity posted on our website), we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply, and any information that you submit to us, such as a resume. 

### Information that We may Collect via Technological Means:

Our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) may collect data from you, such as browser type, operating system, IP address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. Like most Internet services, we automatically gather this data and store it in log files each time you visit our website or access your account on our network.

We may also use “cookies”, i.e., small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a web site. We link the information we store in cookies to the personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our website. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable cookies, some areas of our website may not work properly. The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates or service providers is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. These third parties may use session ID cookies to improve the quality of experience when you interact with our products. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. Our Site is not designed to respond to “do not track” signals received from browsers.

### Information that we may collect from our Customers:

If you decide to purchase the Services and become a PagerDuty customer (“ **Customer** ”), we may collect additional information from you.

First, we – or our third-party credit card or payment processor on our behalf – will collect Personal Data including your credit card number or account information. 

Second, you’ll be required to set your profile, tell us how to contact your organization when faults are detected by the organization’s monitoring tools, and create accounts for the on-call engineers on your team. You’ll be able to set up your preferred contact methods (e.g., phone, SMS, email and/or push notifications) and you will be required to provide the applicable contact information (“ **Contact Information** ”). 

## (B) How We Use the Data We Collect

We use the Personal Data for two basic purposes: provide and improve the Website and the Services.

In particular, we use Contact Information to send alerts to Customers in accordance with the Customer’s notification rules and schedule. 

We may also use Personal Data to facilitate the creation of and secure your account on our network; identify you as a user in our system; provide improved administration of our Website and Services; improve the quality of experience when you interact with our Website and Services; detect and address anomalies, respond to your inquiries related to employment opportunities or other requests; send promotional communications; provide you with hardcopy or electronic newsletters, or surveys; send upgrades and special offers related to our Services and related services and for other marketing purposes of PagerDuty, should you request to receive such communications from us; make telephone calls to you, from time to time, as a part of secondary fraud protection or to solicit your feedback. 

We may also analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of the Website and Services or improve their respective functionalities, or for other business purposes. 

## (C) When We May Disclose Data

We may share your data with third parties to provide technical support or to provide specific services, such as hosting , SMS messaging and payment processing.

Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Data (as described below), PagerDuty may disclose Personal Data if it believes in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on PagerDuty; or (b) protect or defend the rights or property of PagerDuty or users of the Services or related services. 

We may also share any information collected under this Privacy Policy with any of our affiliates, or in connection with any merger, sale of assets, financing, acquisition, or in any other situation where used information may be disclosed or transferred as one of our business assets. 

Except as otherwise stated in this policy, we do not sell, trade, share, or rent the Personal Data collected from our services to third parties other than as outlined in this policy. You expressly consent to the sharing of your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.
