# Privacy Policy | PageSix.com

Effective as of December 2, 2007

[www.pagesix.com](https://web.archive.org/) (the “PageSix.com Website”) is owned and operated by NYP Holdings, Inc. (“NYP” or “we”) and is part of News Corporation, which has adopted a set of [Privacy Principles](http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html "News Corp Privacy Principles") applicable to all its U.S.-based companies. NYP has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information (“PII”-- that is, information such as your full name, email address, mailing address or telephone number) we obtain from users of the PageSix.com Website (“Users”). This Privacy Policy applies to the services offered by NYP on the PageSix.com Website, and any other features, content, applications, or mobile services offered from time to time by NYP in connection with the PageSix.com Website (collectively, the “PageSix.com Services”). The PageSix.com Services are hosted in the United States.

The PageSix.com Website is a general audience site and does not knowingly collect PII from children under 13 years of age. 

From time to time NYP may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and use practices, the features of the PageSix.com Services, or technology. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your PII, those changes will be posted in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of this Privacy Policy. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. If NYP materially changes its practices regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the Privacy Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the change.

COLLECTION: COLLECTION OF PII AND NON-PII BY NYP 

General. When NYP collects PII from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting PII to us in order to register for a User account on PageSix.com. NYP may also collect PII from you if you choose to participate in PageSix.com Services activities like sweepstakes, contests, and surveys, because you want us to furnish you with breaking news, products, services, newsletters, or information in connection your submission of comments or other content, or in connection with content or suggestions you submit to NYP for review. The information required for registration is user name, email address, and at times, password. Other information including but not limited to annual income and zip code may be optional.

In addition, NYP collects other non-PII including IP address, aggregate user data, and browser type. This data is used to manage and improve the PageSix.com Services, track usage, and for security and monitoring purposes. 

Cookies. Cookies are small bits of information that NYP places on the hard drive of your computer.

NOTICE: NYP WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES

When you voluntarily provide PII to NYP, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses NYP will make of the information. 

At the time you provide your PII, NYP will notify you of your options regarding our use of your PII (See “Choice” below). Except as described in this Privacy Policy, NYP will not share your PII with third parties unless you have given NYP permission to do so (See “Use” below). 

PageSix.com Services may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies.

PageSix.com Services may also carry advertisements from other companies. NYP is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites or other services operated by third parties that are linked to the PageSix.com Website or for the privacy practices of third parties or Internet advertising companies. Once you’ve left PageSix.com Services via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you.

Although all News America Group entities adhere to the News America Group’s [Privacy Principles](http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html "News Corporation's Privacy Principles"), visitors to those affiliated sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.

CHOICE: NYP WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII

Except as described in this Privacy Policy, NYP will not use the PII you provide to us for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted, or share your PII with third parties that are not affiliated with NYP, without your permission.

USE: NYP’S USE OF PII

NYP will use the PII you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If NYP obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of that information is also governed by this Privacy Policy. 

If you have consented to receive promotional materials from NYP, NYP may periodically use your email address to send you notifications related to the PageSix.com Services. If you want to stop receiving promotional materials from NYP you can change your account settings under "[My Preferences](https://web.archive.org/user)" or click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of each promotional email. 

NYP employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your PII. NYP may share your PII with outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e., content board administration, statistical analyses, data processing) or with outside contractors, agents or sponsors who help us with the administration, judging and prize fulfillment aspects of contests, promotions, and sweepstakes. These outside contractors, agents or sponsors may cache some information on their servers, but they may only use your PII to provide NYP with a specific service and not for any other purpose. NYP may also provide your PII to a third party in those instances where you have chosen to receive certain information and have been notified that the fulfillment of such a request requires the sharing of your PII. NYP may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us (i.e., part of the News America Group of companies).

As described in “Notice” above, NYP may customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on the PageSix.com Website, or may work with outside companies to do so. Your non-PII may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished. NYP prohibits these companies from sharing your non-PII with any third party or from using it for any other purpose.

NYP may aggregate PII and use it anonymously. Anonymous click stream, number of page views calculated by web beacons, and aggregated demographic information may also be shared with NYP’s advertisers and business partners. 

There may be instances when NYP may disclose PII without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of NYP, other companies within the News America Group or their employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of users of the PageSix.com Services; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if NYP sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, NYP may transfer your PII to a third party as part of that transaction.

SECURITY: NYP PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII

NYP uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. In addition, NYP uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete.
