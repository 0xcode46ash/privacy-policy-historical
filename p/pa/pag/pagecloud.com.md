What Personal Information do we collect?

Canadian privacy legislation defines "Personal Information" broadly as information about an identifiable individual or as information that allows an individual to be identified. For the purposes of this policy, “Personal Information” means information about an identifiable individual as defined from time to time in applicable privacy legislation. Generally speaking, “Personal Information” does not include what is considered business contact information: your name, title or position, business address, telephone number, facsimile number, or e-mail address. The types of Personal Information that PageCloud may collect about you includes your name, home address, telephone number, personal email address, billing and account information and other information incidental to providing our services.

In general, PageCloud collects, uses and discloses Personal Information about our clients and service providers in connection with certain services we make available to you. More specifically, we collect, use and disclose your Personal Information for the following purposes:

  * to share Personal Information to and from third parties for the purpose of providing information about products and services. Such third parties may include other vendors of services and products.

In addition to the identified purposes described in our Privacy Policy, we may use this website information and share it with other organizations with whom we have a commercial relationship to measure the use of our website, to improve the functionality and content of the website and to facilitate usage by a visitor. Visitors can reset their browsers either to notify them when they have received a cookie or refuse to accept cookies. However, if a visitor refuses to accept cookies, he or she may not be able to use some of the features available on our website.
