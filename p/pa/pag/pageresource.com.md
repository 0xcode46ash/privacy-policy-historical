### Privacy Statement for PageResource.Com

The Web Design Resource has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: PageResource.Com.

Our site uses a [contact form](http://www.pageresource.com/contact.htm) and a [site submission form](https://web.archive.org/zdir/addurl.htm) for customers to request information, return links, and services. In these forms, we collect visitor's contact information (like their email address, site addresses, browser information, and remote host). The customer's contact information is used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary.
