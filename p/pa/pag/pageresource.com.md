Our site uses a [contact form](http://www.pageresource.com/contact.htm) and a [site submission form](https://web.archive.org/zdir/addurl.htm) for customers to request information, return links, and services.

If a visitor submits a web site for a link review, the site address, title, and description provided may be posted on the appropriate pages. A visitor's e-mail address is not shared with or sold to any third parties. If you do not want us to know any of the information above, do not submit either form to us.
