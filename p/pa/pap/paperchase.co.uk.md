# security & privacy at Paperchase

At Paperchase, we take care to protect your privacy and secure your information. 

To provide credit card security and keep your personal information safe, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, the most widely used data encryption coding system for secure eCommerce transactions. If your browser doesn't accept the SSL technology, your purchase will not be permitted. All of your information is encrypted (scrambled) prior to being sent over the Internet to our system. To protect your information once we receive it, we place it on Tier 1 PCI DSS certified systems designed to keep information safe and inaccessible to other Internet users. 

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a security standard and our Tier 1 Certification and compliance ensures unbeatable security and protection of sensitive customer information including credit cards. Paperchase.co.uk has gone through a rigorous independent audit and significant investment to attain Tier 1 PCI DSS certification. The purpose is to ensure that your data is as safe as possible when you purchase products online at Paperchase.co.uk.

For return visits to the site, we can securely store your credit card information in our system using that same technology if you opt in for us to save your credit card information. Shopping at Paperchase.co.uk is safe, convenient and secure.
