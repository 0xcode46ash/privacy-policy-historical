# Paper Source - security & privacy

This site uses a secure server (SSL) to encrypt all of your personal information. We use strong security measures to prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of your information once it is in our records. 

Our order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number number), which information is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. SSL is designed to render information unreadable should anyone try to intercept it. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked. In addition, Paper Source _does not store credit card number information._ When ordering online, this information is sent directly to the authorizing banks. 

*Please note that email is not encrypted and is not considered a secure means of transmitting credit card numbers and that we will NEVER ask for sensitive information via email.*
