Paper Source Privacy Policy

_Please note that Paper Source changed its privacy policy as of February 2011._

We know that you trust us with your personal information, and we take the privacy of our customers seriously. Your personal information is used for internal purposes, such as confirming and tracking your order, analyzing trends and statistics, informing you of our new products, services and offers, and providing you with information from and about Paper Source. In addition, we contract with marketing partners to help manage and optimize our web store and brand communications.

Information Sharing

**Catalog** : If you sign up to receive catalogs, information on workshops, projects, local information, new merchandise, store openings or other Paper Source news, we may rent, share, sell or exchange your postal address with certain third parties we believe may be of interest to you. However, e-mail addresses are never shared with these third parties. 

_To opt out_ : If you have your customer number (located on the back of your catalog) and would like to either opt out of having your information shared with these third parties, or opt out of receiving catalog mailings from Paper Source, please fill out this [form](https://web.archive.org/cgi-bin/paper/opt_out.html). If you do not know your customer number you may notify us via [e-mail](mailto:customerservice@paper-source.com) or write us at the mailing address listed below.

**Email** : When you sign up to receive emails from Paper Source we send regular communication regarding new merchandise, workshops, store openings or other Paper Source news. Your e-mail address is never shared or sold to these third parties. 

_To opt out_ : To remove yourself from our email list, please notify our customer service team via [e-mail](mailto:customerservice@paper-source.com).

**Additional Online** : We contract with online companies to provide services that help manage and improve your customer experience, including shipping services, data management, promotional services, etc. We provide our service providers with the information needed for them to perform these services, and ask that these providers have privacy practices consistent with ours.

**Cookies** : As a website visitor, small amounts of data are stored on your computer, which help us improve our site and make it easier for you to use. We never use cookies to save passwords, credit card numbers or other highly confidential information.

**Web Analytics** : Our web analytics provider helps us assess visitation to our website by placing small pixel tags and cookies on our site. While this allows us to track visits and analyze our website traffic, the data retrieved cannot be used for any reason without our authorization.

_To opt out_ : To check or change your cookie status, [click here](https://web.archive.org/cgi-bin/paper/opt_out.html). If you delete your cookies, use a different browser, or buy a new computer, you will need to renew your opt-out. Please allow time for processing. 

**Online Advertising** : We contract with third-party service providers who help us place advertising messages on other websites. These providers may collect anonymous information about your visits to our website, and your interaction with our products and services. They may use this information to target advertising messages to you based on your interests. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is an industry standard technology used by most major websites. Your personal information is not shared with these vendors, as it is made anonymous before it reaches the provider. If you prefer not to receive relevant banner advertising, please visit the NAI (Network Advertising Initiative) website, which allows opt-out for all of its members' cookies from a central opt-out page. [Click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) to opt-out with NAI.

Secure Shopping

This site uses a secure server (SSL) to encrypt all of your personal information. We use strong security measures to prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of your information once it is in our records. 

Our order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), which is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. SSL is designed to render information unreadable should anyone try to intercept it. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked. In addition, Paper Source _does not store credit card number information._ When ordering online, this information is sent directly to the authorizing banks. 

_Please note_ : Email is not encrypted and is not considered a secure means of transmitting credit card numbers. We will **_never_** ask for sensitive information via email. 

Privacy Policy Updates

Paper Source reserves the right to change or modify this policy at any time by posting the revised policy on our website, effective immediately. We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy whenever you purchase products from us or use our website.
