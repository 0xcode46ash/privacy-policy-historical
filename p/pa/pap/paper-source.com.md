# Paper Source - security & privacy

This site uses a secure server (SSL) to encrypt all of your personal information. We use strong security measures to prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of your information once it is in our records. 

Our order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number number), which information is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. SSL is designed to render information unreadable should anyone try to intercept it. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked. In addition, Paper Source _does not store credit card number information._ When ordering online, this information is sent directly to the authorizing banks. 

*Please note that email is not encrypted and is not considered a secure means of transmitting credit card numbers and that we will NEVER ask for sensitive information via email.*

Please note that Paper Source changed its privacy policy as of March 2008. We value the privacy of our customers and we know that you trust us when you provide us with your personal information. We use the personal information you provide for internal purposes, such as confirming and tracking your order, analyzing trends and statistics, informing you of our new products, services and offers, and providing you with information from and about Paper Source. In addition, if you sign up to receive catalogs, information on workshops, projects, local information, new merchandise, store openings or other Paper Source news, we may rent, share, sell or exchange your postal address with certain third parties we believe may be of interest to you. However, e-mail addresses are never shared with these third parties.
