# Privacy & Security

**Thank you for visiting the Papyrus web site.** Papyrus takes your privacy seriously and is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Because we do gather certain types of information from visitors to our web site, we have developed a privacy policy to help our visitors understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of information. This policy only applies to visitors accessing our web site from the United States. By visiting our web site you are accepting the practices described in this policy.

#### Guiding Principles 

  * Papyrus collects information online primarily to provide our visitors with a more relevant experience on our web site. When doing so, we will make every reasonable effort to avoid excessive or irrelevant collection of data.

  * Papyrus will take reasonable physical, electronic and managerial measures to safeguard and secure any information you provide to us (e.g., data will be stored in protected databases on secured servers with restricted access).

  * Papyrus will honor its customers’ requests to not receive future communication from Papyrus




#### Information Collected

Generally, you may visit the Papyrus web site without revealing personal information about yourself. When you visit our web site, however, we may track your Internet domain address, any search engine you may have used to locate the web site, and we may track certain navigational information about where you go on our web site. This information enables us to determine which areas of the web site are most frequently visited and helps us tailor the web site to the needs and interests of our online visitors.

You will remain anonymous unless you specifically request otherwise. When you purchase a product online, we ask for your name, mailing address, phone number, and your credit card number to complete your order. In some cases, we may use this information to personalize your future experience with Papyrus. For example, if your zip code indicates you live near one of our stores, we may notify you about an upcoming event (such as a sale or workshop). If you do not wish to be contacted, please let us know and we will remove your name from our email list immediately (see Opt-Out Procedures below).

#### Disclosure of Personal Information

Papyrus may disclose specific personal information based on a good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to comply with or conform to the law (subpoenas, warrants) or that such disclosure is necessary to protect the users of the web site or the public. 

Further, in the event Papyrus sells or transfers a particular portion of its business assets, consumer information may be one of the business assets transferred as part of the transaction. If substantially all of the assets of Papyrus are acquired, consumer information may be transferred as part of the acquisition.

#### How we Communicate with You

Papyrus may send communications to you on the basis of the information you provide to us through email or postal mail. You may always specifically request not to be contacted (see Opt-Out Procedures below). 

#### Protect Children Accessing this Web Site

Papyrus strives to protect the privacy of children. Children under the age of 13 should obtain parental consent before accessing this web site. We never intend to collect personal information from children under 13.

#### Passwords

The personal data record created through your registration with this web site can only be accessed with the unique password associated with that record. To protect the integrity of the information contained in this record you should not disclose or otherwise reveal your password to third parties. 

#### Opt-Out Procedures

You may always opt-out of receiving future communications from Papyrus by either (a) clicking the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the email message, or (b) making a request through customer service. If you request not to receive information from Papyrus, it may take several weeks to have your name removed from our files. Your request not to receive information will not preclude us from contacting you regarding a question we have about your purchase. 

#### Use of Cookies

Papyrus may use a browser feature known as a “cookie.” Cookies are small text files placed on your hard drive that allow Papyrus to provide you with a customized browsing experience. Papyrus uses cookies to provide you with the convenience of not having to reenter information, such as coupon codes, user ids and passwords multiples times during your visits to the Papyrus web site.

Cookies can also be used to help Papyrus provide you with information targeted to your interests, based upon your prior browsing on the web site. The “help” section of the toolbar on most browsers will inform you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you upon the receipt of a new cookie, or how to disable the use of the cookies completely. We recommend against disabling cookies however, as it will be detrimental to proper website functionality.

#### Links to Third Party Sites

The Papyrus web site may contain links to other sites. Papyrus is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites. To help ensure your privacy, Papyrus recommends that you review the privacy policy of any site you visit. 

#### Accessing the Papyrus Web Site from Outside the United States

If you are visiting this web site from a location outside the United States, your connection will be through and to servers located in the United States. Any information you provide during your visit will be processed and maintained on our web server and other internal systems located within the United States. 

#### Security

We use state-of-the-art software to encrypt your credit card numbers and personal information automatically while they are in transit over the Internet, preventing a third party from viewing this information. The instant you reach our checkout page, your browser should indicate that you have entered our secure shopping zone. Each web browser offers a different security indicator—please refer to your browser’s help section to learn more. If you do not see any secure shopping indicators, please call our customer service number at 1-800-789-1649 to complete your transaction.

An internal security system, known as a firewall, protects information about our customers from being viewed by a third party. Information access is restricted within our offices as well. Personal information collected about our customers is only viewable by employees who need the information to perform a specific job (such as a billing clerk or customer service representative), and the personal information is protected by a random password. 

Unfortunately, however, due to the nature of the Internet the privacy and security of every transmission over the Internet cannot be absolutely guaranteed. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the privacy and security of the information you transmit to our web site. 

#### Policy Changes

We reserve the right to change, modify, or amend this policy at any time. If amended, the effective date of the policy amendment will always be posted at the beginning of this policy. The new policy will replace any prior policies to the extent that there are any inconsistencies. Use of this web site after modification, implies that you consent to the policy as amended.
