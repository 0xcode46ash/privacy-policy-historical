This is a web site hosted by [Magenta Sites](http://www.magentasites.net/). 

## What Information is collected?

We maintain log files which contain IP addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. We do not link IP addresses to personal information. In general, we only use log files to monitor traffic on our Web sites and to troubleshoot technical problems. In the event of abuse, however, we may block certain IP addresses. 

The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web page and not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes. 

## Email Correspondence

We may respond to email sent directly to us or through a online submission form. The sender's e-mail address is not shared with third parties and would only rarely be used for one time correspondence with that user. These e-mails are kept internally for our own day to day business purposes. 

We do not maintain e-mail lists nor market via e-mail. 

## Legal Disclaimer

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.
