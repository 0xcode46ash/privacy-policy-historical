# Privacy policy - Paperdoll Heaven

This is a web site hosted by [Magenta Sites](http://www.magentasites.net/). 

## What Information is collected?

We maintain log files which contain IP addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. We do not link IP addresses to personal information. In general, we only use log files to monitor traffic on our Web sites and to troubleshoot technical problems. In the event of abuse, however, we may block certain IP addresses. 

The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web page and not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes. 

## Email Correspondence

We may respond to email sent directly to us or through a online submission form. The sender's e-mail address is not shared with third parties and would only rarely be used for one time correspondence with that user. These e-mails are kept internally for our own day to day business purposes. 

We do not maintain e-mail lists nor market via e-mail. 

## Special Notification with respect to Children's Privacy (Users under the age of 13)

In response to concerns about protecting children's privacy online, Congress enacted the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), which sets forth rules and procedures governing the ways in which Web sites may collect, use and disclose any personal information for children under the age of 13. In accordance with our policy and COPPA regulations, we DO NOT: 

  1. Request or knowingly collect personally identifiable online or offline contact information from users under 13 years of age;
  2. Knowingly use or share personal information from users under 13 years of age with third parties;
  3. Give children the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information;
  4. Entice children with the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity to divulge more information than is needed to participate in the activity.



## Parental Rights

Except on our Forum we DO NOT collect information from children under 13. We are required by COPPA to post parental rights concerning removal of this information. 

A Parent may 

  * confirm, correct or have deleted the child's personal information
  * discontinue further use of the child's information and/or communication with the child; and/or
  * revoke his or her earlier consent to collect and use the child's information.



To do so, please contact us at info@cheatplanet.com and we will review or update your child's information as appropriate. Please be sure to include in your email message the information you want changed or deleted. 

## Legal Disclaimer

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site. 

## Links to Other Sites

Links to other sites are operated independently and out of our control. We recommend you not share personal information on other sites unless you view their privacy policy.
