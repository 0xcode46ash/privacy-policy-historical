We recommend that you carefully review this Policy before providing us with your personal information. 

### Scope

This Policy applies to all of the services and Web sites offered by Premiere Global Services (collectively, the “Site”) and to all personal information that we directly collect or receive from you, whether manually or digitally processed. It does not apply to information our customers collect or receive from you.
