# Privacy Policy | PGi

Premiere Global Services, Inc. and our subsidiaries (collectively, “PGi”) recognize and respect the importance of protecting your privacy. To that end, we have adopted the principles set forth in this privacy policy (this “Policy”) to govern our use and disclosure of your personal information. While it is impossible to guarantee that such information is or will be completely safe from unauthorized access or use, the following Policy is intended to inform you of the steps we take to protect the information you choose to provide to us. We recommend that you carefully review this Policy before providing us with your personal information.

**Scope**

This Policy applies to all of the services offered by PGi (“PGi Services”) and all of PGi’s websites, including all PGi websites that link to this Policy (but not to those PGi websites that have their own privacy statement) (collectively, the “Websites”) and to all personal information that we directly collect or receive from you, whether manually or digitally processed. It does not apply to information our customers collect or receive from you. While we take commercially reasonable measures to protect all personal information in our control or possession, we cannot guarantee or enforce the privacy policies of our customers. For this reason, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of our individual customers’ websites before disclosing any personal information to or through them.

PGi has been awarded TRUSTe’s Privacy Seal signifying that this Policy and our practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with[ TRUSTe’s Program Requirements](http://www.truste.com/privacy_seals_and_services/consumer_privacy/privacy-programs-requirements.html) including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information. The TRUSTe program covers information that may be collected through the Websites and does not cover information that may be collected through our mobile applications.

TRUSTe’s mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through its leading privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions. If you have questions or complaints regarding this Policy or our practices, please contact us at privacy@pgi.com. If you are not satisfied with our response you can contact TRUSTe [here](http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint%20).

It is solely your choice whether or not you provide this information. However, should you choose not to provide the information, we may be unable to process an order, fulfill PGi Services or display certain content on the PGi Services. To the extent we provide any location-based services, we may automatically collect, use and share location data when you use the Service and we will treat this data as non-personal information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.
