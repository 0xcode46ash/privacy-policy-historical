General

Procter & Gamble respects the privacy of every individual who visits our websites or responds to our interactive advertisements. This Privacy Statement outlines the information Procter & Gamble will collect and how we will use that information. This Statement will also instruct you on how you can verify the accuracy of your personally identifiable information submitted to Procter & Gamble through our websites and interactive advertisements and how you can request that we delete your personally identifiable information from our databases.

Please note, the privacy practices described in the Privacy Statement apply only to Procter & Gamble's websites that are directed to residents of the United States. If you link to other Procter & Gamble sites, please review the privacy policies posted at those sites.

Personally Identifiable Information

When you visit Procter & Gamble's websites or interactive advertisements, we will not collect any personally identifiable information about you (such as your name, address, telephone number, social security number, billing and shipping information, credit card information or e-mail address) unless you provide it to us voluntarily. In addition, some of our websites or interactive advertisements invite visitors to submit names, e-mail addresses or addresses of others in connection with certain promotions or offers that appear on our websites or interactive advertisements, including offers to purchase products online or to receive samples or information. If you opt not to provide us with personally identifiable information no material consequences will result, although you may be unable to participate in certain promotions, receive product information, or buy products offered through Procter & Gamble's websites or interactive advertisements.

Use of Personally Identifiable Information  


Procter & Gamble may store and process your personally identifiable information to better understand your needs and how we may improve our products and services, and we may use your personally identifiable information to contact you (for example, we may send you marketing or promotional materials or other information, we may respond to your comments or requests for information, or we may contact you if needed in the course of processing or shipping your order for products or services offered over our web sites). We may also enhance or merge personally identifiable information with data obtained from third parties for the same purposes. Procter & Gamble will not give or sell your personally identifiable information to any outside organization for the organization's own use without your consent. Your information may be shared with agents or contractors of Procter & Gamble in connection with services that these individuals or entities perform for Procter & Gamble. Individually identifiable information submitted in connection with employment inquiries will be used only in the application process.

The copy, claims and offers contained in this website are directed at residents of the United States and are valid only in the United States. At times, if you direct comments to us or if you request information from us, we may ask you to verify that you live in the United States so that we can be assured that the response or information we provide is appropriate for your country of residence. If the personally identifiable information that you submit indicates that you are not a resident of the United States, your information may be shared with the Procter & Gamble subsidiary in your home geography. This subsidiary may not be governed by the same privacy policy as this site. If you would rather that we did not share your personally identifiable information with the P&G subsidiary in your home geography please do not submit information to P&G websites that are directed to United States residents.

Security

Procter & Gamble is committed to keeping secure the data you provide us and will take reasonable precautions to protect your personally identifiable information from loss, misuse or alteration. Agents or contractors of Procter & Gamble who have access to your personally identifiable information in connection with providing services for Procter & Gamble are required to keep the information confidential and are not permitted to use this information for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for Procter & Gamble.

Children

Procter & Gamble has no intention of collecting any personally identifiable information from individuals under thirteen years of age. Where appropriate, Procter & Gamble will specifically instruct children not to submit such information on our websites or advertisements. If a child has provided us with personally identifiable information, a parent or guardian of that child may contact us at the e-mail address or address listed at the bottom of this Privacy Statement if they would like this information deleted from our records. We will use reasonable efforts to delete the child's information from our databases.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information Collected Automatically

In some cases, we may collect information about you that is not personally identifiable. Examples of this type of information include the type of internet browser or computer operating system you are using and the domain name of the website from which you linked to our site or advertisement. In addition, when you view one of our websites or advertisements, we may store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a "cookie" or similar file and will help us in many ways. For example, cookies allow us to tailor a website or advertisement to better match your interests and preferences. Most internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. Procter & Gamble does not collect personally identifiable information automatically, but we may tie information collected automatically to your previously submitted personally identifiable information.

Contacting Us Regarding Your Personally Identifiable Information

If you have submitted personally identifiable information through a Procter & Gamble website or interactive advertisement, or if someone else has submitted your personally identifiable information through a Procter & Gamble website or interactive advertisement, and you would like to have that information deleted from our marketing databases, please contact us via e-mail at misc.im@pg.com, or send a letter to our Privacy Compliance Coordinator at Box 599, TN-8, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202. If you prefer, you may also select this Delete Personal Information link and provide us with the requested information. We will then use reasonable efforts to remove your personally identifiable information from our files. You may also contact us through either of the above methods to request the personally identifiable information that Procter & Gamble has collected about you through its websites or interactive advertisements. Procter & Gamble will use reasonable efforts to supply you with this information and correct any factual inaccuracies in this information.
