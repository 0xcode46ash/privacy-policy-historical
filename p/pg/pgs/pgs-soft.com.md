# Privacy policy | PGS Software

We do our best to protect your privacy and secure any personal data you share with us. Thus, we abide by the applicable laws. The following Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand the reasons we ask you for some personal data and the way we may use them while keeping the highest security standards.

## Collecting and using personal information

We will only collect personal data from you (such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, company name etc.) when you are specifically asked to share them and voluntarily decide to do so (contact form), or unless otherwise permitted by applicable laws and regulations for the protection of your personal data.

The main reason we need your data for is to answer business inquiry, propose a business agreement or provide you with any information you ask about. Provided you are one of our clients, we may also store and use your personal data for the sake of regular communication during project development and to maintain client relationship e.g. to send newsletters. Occasionally, we may also share it with our business associates so that we can better answer your business demands and develop our relationship. Another reason for a contact may be conducting an online survey to help us understand your business needs or present you with a special offer. However, we will not contact you or send you any materials if you do not agree on our use of your personal data to maintain client relationship (such as market research or newsletters). We never sell or otherwise share your personal data with third parties, except with our business associates.

## Limitation

We will only collect, use or share your personal data for the purposes indicated by you, unless:

  * we need them to perform additional actions directly related to the primary reason for which it was collected;
  * we need them to prepare, negotiate and perform a contract with you;
  * legal, governmental or judiciary authorities demand them;
  * they are required to establish or maintain a legal claim or defence;
  * they are required to prevent fraud or other illegal activities, such as purposeful attacks on our company information systems.
