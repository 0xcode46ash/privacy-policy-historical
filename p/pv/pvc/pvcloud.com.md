# Privacy Policy

Planview and its subsidiaries respect your privacy. In order to provide you with relevant information and respond to your requests, we sometimes request that you provide us with information about yourself. This Privacy Statement informs you of our privacy practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected online and how that information is used. Planview operates in the business-to-business software industry, and does not focus on consumer users or the collection of consumer data. To the extent we collect information on-line, our purpose is to better serve our business customers. Also, any reference to a Planview website includes all of our websites as well as those of our subsidiaries.

This Privacy Statement applies with respect to both our on-line and off-line methods of data collection and use of the information collected. Planview complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.
