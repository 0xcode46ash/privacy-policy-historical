The following is intended to explain our current practices. We reserve the right to amend our policy and practice at any point without notice.

If you have questions or concerns about our privacy policy or current practices, please contact [info@sbc.edu](mailto:info@sbc.edu).

### Information Collected

Information about your Web browser, proxy and firewall servers, and other things relevant to your browsing our site, is collected automatically by our servers so we might best understand our Web browsing audience. However, unless required by appropriate legal authorities, Sweet Briar College will not use this information to specifically identify you in any way.

### Personal Information

If you choose to provide us with any personal information via this Web site (complete an online form, register for an event, request additional information, sign up for a mailing list, etc.), be assured that information will be used only for the purpose indicated. We will not sell, exchange or otherwise distribute your personally identifiable information without your consent, except as required by law. We will not keep the information longer than necessary for normal operations.

### Cookies

Cookies are pieces of information stored by your Web browser. Portions of our site may use cookies to carry data from one Web page to the next. We do not forward cookies to any external parties. If you prefer not to allow our site to use cookies, consult the documentation provided with your Web browser to turn off the appropriate "accept cookies" feature in your browser. The settings on cookies contained in your browser constitute a grant of permission (or lack thereof) for us to store information on your computer.

We follow all industry standards in constructing and storing cookies with your browser. Thus, it is your browser vendor's responsibility to provide for secure and appropriate cookie storage mechanisms.

### Communications

If you have provided Sweet Briar College with your physical mailing address and/or e-mail address, we reserve the right to send you appropriate marketing information or other College communications. If you request to be removed from our contact list, we will honor that request and will discontinue the sending of mass marketing and promotional messages.

### External Links

Our Web site may contain links to Web sites or resources that are external to the Sweet Briar College domain. Since we may not maintain an ongoing relationship with all of those sites, we cannot guarantee the availability of those resources, their content, or the delivery of those services. We also cannot guarantee the same level of privacy and security maintained by those external sites; external sites are not bound by Sweet Briar's privacy policy. As a result, we encourage you to read others' privacy policies, which may differ from ours.
