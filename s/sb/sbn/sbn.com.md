**__Privacy Policy__**

SBN endeavors to provide excellent service to you through our products and services. To achieve these goals, we occasionally need information about you when you visit our site. Your privacy is of utmost importance to us, and these policies explain how we use your information. 

**Information Collection and Use**

SBN is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. SBN collects information from our users at several different points on our web site, but always with your knowledge and choice to opt out. Data collected may include information you provide when registering to receive goods or services, information you provide if you contact our customer service center, and information you provide when entering into a contest, sweepstakes or promotion sponsored by SBN and/or one of our partners. SBN may also collect information at other times. 

**Orders**

We may request information from you on order forms. Here you may be asked to provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with you. 

**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive containing information about you. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. If you choose to reject the cookies, you may still use our site, but you may be limited in some areas of our site. 

Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. 

**Log Files**

We use IP addresses to analyze traffic and to administer the site. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Sharing**

We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

We may use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

**Links**

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site. 

**Security**

This web site takes every precaution to protect your information, both online and offline. 

When we ask you to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is protected with secure socket layer (SSL) encryption. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also protect information offline. Your information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our accounting department and customer service representatives) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Moreover, the servers that we use to store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment. 

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**

If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if you no longer desire our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can usually be done by emailing [webmaster@sbn.com](mailto:webmaster@sbn.com) with Change in the subject line. 

**Choice/Opt-out**

You are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who buy a listing from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists. Your opt-out choice will be presented in the form of a check box following a statement to the effect that you do not wish to have your information retained for other purposes. If an opt-out choice is not presented at a specific location, that means that we are not using your personal information for any reason other than to process your request. 

You may also opt out by emailing [webmaster@sbn.com](mailto:webmaster@sbn.com) with Remove in the subject line. 

**Access by Children**

SBN web sites are not structured to attract children under the age of 13. Our affiliated companies believe there is no information on their web sites that is inappropriate for viewing by children. Ordering on-line products and services is limited to adults. 

**Notification of Changes**

To improve the service we offer, the information obtained about you may be revised in the future. This privacy statement will be updated to reflect any future developments in Internet business practices. 

Effective August 2000.
