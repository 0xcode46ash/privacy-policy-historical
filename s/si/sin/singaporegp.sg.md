    18. Personal Data that we no longer need is either erased and/or anonymised so that you can no longer be identified from it.
    19. We employ appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your Personal Data from being accessed by unauthorized persons and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. We also endeavour to take all reasonable steps to protect Personal Data from external threats such as malicious software or hacking. However, there are always inherent risks in sending information by public networks or using public computers and we cannot 100% guarantee the security of all data sent to us.
    20. **Your Personal Data rights**
    21. Under the GDPR, those EU/EEA residents with whom we deal have various data protection rights, which are as follows: 
    22. you can request information about the Personal Data that we hold about you, what we use that Personal Data for; who it may be shared with as well as certain other information (this is called a 'subject access right'). Usually we will have a month to respond to a 'subject access right' request although where we have a complex request, we may require a further two months to respond. We may also charge for administrative time in dealing with any manifestly unreasonable or excessive requests. We may also require further information to locate specific information you seek and you should note that certain legal exemptions may also apply to what we can disclose in response; 
      1. you can ask that we correct Personal Data that we hold about you which is inaccurate or incomplete; 
      2. you can object to us conducting any automated processing in relation to your Personal Data (if applicable), for example if we conduct any automated credit scoring; 
      3. you can object to us continuing to use your Personal Data to send you direct marketing; 
      4. you can request that we erase your Personal Data if we no longer need to hold it; 
      5. you can object or ask us to restrict the use of your Personal Data for any purpose unless we have a compelling legitimate reason for doing so (e.g. a legal obligation); or
      6. you can ask us to transfer your electronically held Personal Data to another party where it has been collected with your consent or is being used by us to perform contact.
    23. If you would like to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us using the contact details above. We may need to ask for evidence to verify your identity before we can fully respond.
    24. If you make a request and are not satisfied with our response, or believe that we are illegally processing your Personal Data, you have the right to complain to a data protection supervisory authority in your EU country of residence.
