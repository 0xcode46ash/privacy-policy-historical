# Privacy Policy | Singular

Singular Labs, Inc. (“we”, “us” or “Singular”) provides command and control solutions for mobile advertising (the “Solution”). Singular respects your right to privacy. Your ability to make informed choices about the uses of your information is important to us. This privacy policy details how we collect, use and store information and data that we receive. This privacy policy also details our mutual confidentiality obligations to the extent you use the Solution. If you have any comments or questions about our privacy policies, please contact us at contact@singular.net.

**How We Collect and Use Information**  
Through the Solution, we may have access to your data regarding your advertising and marketing campaigns. You shall not provide us with any Personal Information regarding any third party. As used in this privacy policy, “Personal Information” means information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address.

We will not share your data with any third party without your explicit permission, except when required by law, regulation, subpoena or court order or as otherwise expressly set forth herein. We may use such data internally – for example, to help diagnose problems with our servers, and to make the Application more useful for you and for our other customers.

By analyzing all information we receive, we may compile statistical information across a variety of users (“Statistical Information”). Statistical Information helps understand trends and customer needs so that new services can be considered and so the Applications and associated services can be tailored to customer desires.

**How we Protect Information**  
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Confidentiality**  
This confidentiality provision applies solely if we have entered into an agreement to provide you with the Solution. Either party (the “Disclosing Party”) may disclose to the other party (the “Receiving Party”) certain confidential information regarding the technology and business of the Disclosing Party (“Confidential Information”). Subject to the terms of this privacy policy, the Receiving Party agrees to keep confidential and not disclose or use any Confidential Information except for purposes of providing or receiving the Solution or in furtherance of the relationship of the parties hereunder. Confidential Information shall not include information that the Receiving Party can show (a) was already lawfully known to or independently developed by the Receiving Party without access to or use of Confidential Information, as shown by contemporary documentary evidence, (b) is publicly and generally available, free of confidentiality restrictions; or (c) is required to be disclosed by law, provided that the Receiving Party provides the Disclosing Party with prompt notice of such requirement and cooperates at the expense of the Receiving Party in order to minimize such requirement.

**Other Uses or Transfer of Your Information**  
We will fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity or behavior of any user suspected to have engaged in illegal behavior. We may use subcontractors that are located in countries other than your own, and send them information we receive. For example, we may send your information to any countries outside the United States, Canada or the European Union. All our subcontractors will be subject to non-disclosure and non-use obligations. Nevertheless, some countries may have levels of protection of personal and other information which are not as high as in your country of residence or business.

We may transfer our databases containing information if we sell our business or part of it.
