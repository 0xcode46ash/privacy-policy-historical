# TheZenith - Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting the Zenith Insurance Company Web Site. This document is our privacy statement, which we have created in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the protection of the privacy of you, our customers and visitors. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for [www.thezenith.com](http://www.thezenith.com/), and for any other Web Site operated by our companies. 

**A Special Note About Children**

Children under the age of 18 are not eligible to use our services and we ask that such persons not submit personal information to us or use this Web Site. We believe that is important that parents supervise their children when they are online. As a result, we require that children under the age of 18 use the Web Site service only in conjunction with parents or guardians.

**Information Collected, Use and Disclosure of Your Information**

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web Site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information. 

We use cookies on certain pages of our site. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our site. Most cookies are "session cookies" which means that they are automatically deleted at the end of each session. A cookie itself does not have the ability to automatically collect personal information about you. A cookie can store certain information that identifies your computer to us so that you don't have to re-enter your password as frequently when you use our site. 

The Web Site's registration form requires users to give us contact information including your name, address and phone number, financial information including credit card numbers, and demographic information including zip code (information about age, gender and income will be optional). The customer's contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary in the day to day running of the auctions and sales.

We also occasionally send email to our users announcing changes in our services and other information we believe will be of interest to our customers and potential customers. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial information that is collected is used to check the users' qualifications for registration and to bill the user for products and services. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site.

If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on our site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you. We use information in the file that we maintain for you, and other information that we obtain from your use of the services, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our agreement for [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20020625114419id_/http%3A//www.singlepoint.com/main/termsofuse.asp).

We have partnered with various affiliates and companies, and gather information regarding services and products our partners may provide. This information may be made available to those affiliates and companies on an individual or aggregate basis.

We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Statement. For example, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.

**Linked Sites**

For your convenience, this site contains links to other sites. Zenith is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web Sites. For more information about our policies with regard to third party Web Sites, please see the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20020625114419id_/http%3A//www.singlepoint.com/main/termsofuse.asp).

**Security**

All user information stored on our server is stored in an encrypted format. Notwithstanding these efforts, we caution you that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. In particular, as described in the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20020625114419id_/http%3A//www.singlepoint.com/main/termsofuse.asp), you are solely responsible for protecting the security of your password. Do not share or disclose it to anyone at any time.
