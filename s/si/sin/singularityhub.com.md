# Privacy Policy - Singularity Hub

_Effective Date 25 May 2018_

## Introduction

Singularity Education Group (“Singularity”, “SU”, “us”, “our”, and “we”) takes your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy has been designed to answer your questions about your privacy rights while you engage our websites and mobile application(s) (collectively, “Sites”), as well as when you participate in SU programs and events and/or license our content and software products (collectively “Solutions”). If you need more information, please refer to the [Contact Us Section](https://su.org/privacy-policy/#contact) of this policy below.

## Purpose

This Privacy Policy applies to Singularity Sites and Solutions that link to or reference this Policy. This Policy describes how we handle Personal Information, as defined in the section below, and the choices available to you regarding: i) how we collect, use, and access your Personal Information; and ii) how to confirm your Personal Information is updated, corrected, and/or deleted. Additional terms and information about SU’s Personal Information handling practices may be provided in offer descriptions, supplement statements or contract terms, or notices provided prior to or at the time of information collection.

## Definition of Personal Information

### (What is Personal Information?)

“Personal information” is any information that can be used to identify an individual, and may include, but is not limited to, for example, name, address, email address, phone number, login information (account number, password), marketing preferences, social media account information, IP addresses, location data (if combined with other identifiers), personal identification numbers (passport numbers, social security numbers, etc.), photos, video footage with your likeness, audio recordings, payment card number, criminal record, educational and professional records, and any form of biometric, health, genetic, racial, religion, political affiliation, gender-based, sexual preference, age-related, or other identifying personal data. If we link other data with your personal information, we will treat that linked data as Personal Information. We also collect Personal Information from trusted third-party sources and engage third parties to collect Personal Information to assist us.

## Collection and Use of Your Personal Information

### (What Personal Information Do We Collect and Why Do We Need It?)

We may collect a variety of information, including Personal Information, about you as you use our Sites and Solutions and interact with us. For a complete listing of the Personal Information we typically collect and how we use it by Site and Solution family, please [download the SU Personal Information Collection and Usage](https://su.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SU-Personal-Information-Collection-and-Usage.pdf) document. A summary of what we collect and how we use the Personal Information associated with our main  Site and Solutions is compiled for your convenience below.

### _Community Membership Profile:_

When you become an SU community member, we collect information about you including (but not limited to) your name, your employer’s name, your work address (including your country location), and your email address. We may also collect your personal email address, a personal mailing address, and a mobile phone number. We ask members to voluntarily provide additional information in their membership profile, such as information about their educational background, professional experience, interests in exponential technologies, a photo, social media identifiers, and some other information. Members may edit their profile at any time to change, add, or remove Personal Information.

We process your personal information for membership administration, to deliver member benefits to you, and to inform you of SU-related events, content, and other benefits or opportunities associated with your SU membership. We may also use this information to help us understand our members’ needs and interests to better tailor our Site and Solutions to meet your needs.

Members can participate in local SU chapter meetings organized by volunteers which take place at various locations. We may collect registration information from SU users, community members and their guests, which we may share with a sponsoring SU partner and location hosts for purposes of verifying registration and to ensure only registered guests are allowed attendance.

### _Personal Information Provided at Live or Web Programs and Events_

SU hosts many events throughout the year. These include in-person and web-based conferences, summits, speakers’ series, and other in-person as well as virtual gatherings (collectively “events”). If you register for one of our events and you are a member, we will access the information in your member account to provide you with information and services associated with the event. If you are not a member and you register for one of our events, we will collect your name, telephone number, address, email address and select other information, which we will store in our database(s) and use to provide you with information and services associated with the current and future events, SU community membership and SU content.

If you are a presenter or speaker at one of our events, we will collect information about you including your name, employer, educational and professional background, contact information, and photograph.  We may collect information provided by event attendees who evaluated your performance as a presenter. We may also make and store a recording of your voice and likeness in certain instances.

If you attend an in person SU event, you may be offered the option to download a mobile application to help you navigate the event and plan your schedule. This event app may require the device identifier associated with your device but does not collect or use any other personal data without your consent.

Some of our events are sponsored. We may provide an attendee list to certain sponsors. If you do not wish to have your information shared with a sponsor or to receive information from sponsors, you can express your preferences when you register for events.

### _Personal Information Provided to Acquire Content Access_

We offer exciting content for SU’s community members and non-community members alike. In addition to producing original content, we also subscribe to news feeds and blogs produced by others, which we link to and from our website. This means you may find yourself on an SU site or reading SU content and we will offer you a link to another organization’s website where you will find content on exponential technologies or exponential thinking that we or our faculty find relevant and useful to you. At these times, you will be leaving the SU Site(s). SU is not responsible or liable for content provided by these third party websites or Personal Information they may happen to gather from you.

You may manage your SU subscriptions by subscribing or unsubscribing at any time. Please note that if you have set your browser to block cookies, this may have an impact on your ability to unsubscribe. If you have any difficulties managing your email or other communication preferences with SU, please contact us at [info@su.org](mailto:info@su.org).

We use Google Analytics to track how often people gain access to or read our content. We use this information in the aggregate to understand what content our community members find useful or interesting, so we can produce the most valuable content to meet your needs.

We also conduct surveys that we use to evaluate content quality and relevance to our SU community. We do not track individuals but look at information in the aggregate only. Participation in surveys is voluntary.

### _Personal Information Provided in Site or Solution Forums and Chat Rooms_

If you participate in an SU community member or cohort forum or chat room on an SU Site or Solution, the information, including Personal Information, you provide there will be made available to others, and could be used to contact you, send you unsolicited messages, or for purposes over which neither SU nor you has control.  Forums, chat rooms, and social media controlled by individual members of the SU member community may have additional rules and conditions or none at all. As further described in the Terms of Use applicable to Sites and Solutions, SU is not responsible for the Personal Information or any other information you choose to submit in these forums.  To request removal of your Personal Information from forums and chat rooms located on SU Sites, please contact us using the [Personal Information Access Request Form](https://su.org/contact/privacy-and-data-access/). In some situations, due to current technology limitations, it may not be feasible to remove some or all of your Personal Information from these forums.

### _Personal Information Provided for Training_

You may sign up directly with us to participate in our in-person or on-line training courses delivered over a learning management system (LMS), in which case, we collect your name and contact information directly from you. Alternatively your employer or an SU partner may register you to participate in the training. Your Personal Information will be stored in our database (hosted by a cloud service provider) and may also be shared with a delivery partner or co-sponsor of the training program (to verify numbers and attendance rates), trainers (to determine the experience level, industry, and the demographics of the target audience(s)), and/or vendors supporting event delivery (to verify your identity).

### _Personal Information Provided in Correspondence with Singularity_

If you correspond with us by email, the postal service, or other form of communication, we may retain the correspondence and the information contained in it and use it to respond to your inquiry and to keep a record of the complaint, accommodation, or other request.

If you ask us not to contact you by email at a certain email address, SU will retain a copy of that email address on its “master do not send” list in order to comply with your no-contact request.

### _Personal Information Provided to Process Payment_

You may purchase Solutions using a payment card. Payment card information may be provided directly by users, via an SU Site or authorized third party event registration vendor site, into the PCI/DSS-compliant payment processing service to which SU subscribes. We do not process or store the card information. Occasionally, members or customers ask SU employees or SU event volunteers to enter payment card or other financial account information into the PCI/DSS-compliant payment processing service to which SU subscribes. We strongly encourage you not to submit this information by email. When SU employees receive payment card or other financial account information from customers or members by email, fax, phone, or mail, it is entered as instructed and then deleted or destroyed.

### _Personal Information Received from Third Parties_

Periodically, SU receives Personal Information about individuals from third parties. For example, this may happen if your employer is participating in a corporate program and signs you up for an event, training, SU membership, or SU Solution access. SU may also collect Personal Information about prospective employees, faculty, vendors, contractors, and partners from due diligence vendors who conduct business and criminal history background checks on information available from the public domain.

### _Personal Information Collected Electronically_

#### Personal Information Collected on Sites

We use automatic data collection tools on our Sites, such as cookies, embedded web links, and web beacons. These tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends back to our Site(s).  Examples include:

  * Browser type and version;
  * Address of the website from which you arrived at our Site;
  * Your Internet Protocol (IP) Address: this is a number automatically assigned to your computer or device whenever you connect to the Internet. It is a unique address assigned by your Internet service provider or IT department on a TCP/IP network. Among other things, the IP address allows web servers to locate and identify your device; and
  * Clickstream Behavior: this includes the pages you view and the links you click.  These tools help make your visit to our Sites easier, more efficient, and more valuable by providing you with a customized experience and recognizing you when you return.



#### Use of Google Analytics and Other Backend Analytics Tools

We use Google Analytics, a service that transmits our Site traffic to Google servers in the United States. Google Analytics does not identify individual users or associate your IP address with other data held by Google.  We use reports and data provided by Google Analytics and other website traffic tracking services to help us understand our Site traffic trends and usage. For more information regarding how Google collects and processes data, please visit www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners.

We may also collect location data from the GPS on your device.

#### Do Not Track Option

Some web browsers may give you the ability to enable a “do not track” feature that sends signals to the SU Sites you visit, instructing that you do not want your online activities to be tracked.  Be aware that this is different from blocking or deleting cookies. Browsers with “do not track” features enabled may still accept cookies. SU Sites do not currently recognize and respond to “do not track” signals. If we do in the future, we will describe how in this Privacy Policy.
