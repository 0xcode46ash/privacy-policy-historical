Subject to your agreement to certain terms and conditions in the Software Use Agreement and/or SideStep Terms of Service, you can access and use the Service through software that you download to your web browser (the "SideStep Software") and the SideStep web site at www.sidestep.com ("SideStep Web site or "Site"). 

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you of the following: 

  * What kind of information does SideStep collect about you?
  * How will the information that SideStep collects be used?
  * With whom does SideStep share the information it collects about you?

  * How can I access the information SideStep has about me or correct it?



SideStep takes the privacy of your personal information very seriously and will use your information only in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. SideStep will not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. However, as described in more detail in Section 4 below, there are limited circumstances when some of your personal information will be shared with third parties, under certain restrictions. 

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the SideStep Terms of Service. By using the SideStep Web site and/or the SideStep Software you are agreeing to the SideStep Terms of Service and providing your express consent to the use and disclosure of information you provide to SideStep as described in this Privacy Policy. 

  
Because our business and services are changing and improving all the time, in the future we may find it necessary to make changes to this Privacy Policy. If you have registered with SideStep, we will notify you via email if we are going to use or disclose your personal information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time we collected the information. At that time, you will have a choice as to whether or not SideStep can use or disclose your information in this new way. Any such material changes will become effective 30 days after we have provided you with email notice of the proposed amendments to the Privacy Policy. We will also prominently post such material changes on the SideStep Web site at least 30 days prior to their taking effect. We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy whenever you visit the Site, use the SideStep Software or access and use the Service. 

  
Whenever you use the SideStep Service, we will assign a unique User ID number to your computer which will be linked to information about your use of the SideStep Service generally, including the searches you perform and the times you choose to click on, and purchase, items searched. Unless you choose to enter your personal information as part of Optional Information (see below) then your User ID is not linked to any information from which you can be personally identified. 

  
When you download the Software, you have the option (but are not required) to provide SideStep with your name and email address. After you download the Software, you have the option (but are not required) to provide us additional information about yourself by setting your Preferences. This information includes items such as your home airport, zip code, and whether you are primarily a leisure or business traveler among others (“Optional Information”). If you provide us with such Optional Information, we may use it in order to improve the Service or Software that we provide to you or to provide you with information about the Service and Software (including, for example, new features and upgrades, new SideStep services, special promotions and offers). If you are receiving emails from SideStep and no longer wish to receive them, you can unsubscribe either by clicking the unsubscribe link on one of the emails you receive or by going to the SideStep [unsubscribe](http://www.sidestep.com/newsletter/unsubscribe.do) page on the Site. Any Optional Information you choose to provide will be linked to your User ID. 

  
If you access and use the Service, our Web server logs typical information, including: 

>   * The URL of the page requested 
>   * The time and date of the request 
>   * The type, version, and configuration of Web browser being used 
>   * The type of Operating System being used 
>   * The URL of the web site where you clicked on a link to get to the SideStep Web site. This URL might contain a code to help identify the specific advertisement clicked on. 
>   * The IP address to which a copy of the page you requested is to be sent for display by your browser 
> 


This information is linked to your User ID and helps us determine whether your computer has the minimum requirements necessary to download the Software and is used to help us improve the Service. 

  
"Cookies" are small files of data that reside on your computer and allow us to recognize you as a user of the Service if you return to the SideStep Web site using the same computer and browser. SideStep uses cookies in the following ways: 

>   * A User ID cookie will be used to track your use of the Service. This cookie will be linked to any Optional Information you provide, and will remain on your computer until you choose to delete it. 
>   * The Service will place other cookies on your computer to track your use of the Service and the Software, and to aim to ensure that any advertising delivered is relevant to you. These will be linked to any Optional Information you provide, and will remain on your computer until you choose to delete them. 
>   * Various temporary session cookies are used each time you access the Service. These only remain on your computer until you close your browser (typically when you next log off). 
> 


You may de-activate the receipt of cookies by your computer at any time by following the relevant instructions in your browser software; however, if you do so you may not be able to correctly receive certain elements of the SideStep Service.

We use third-parties to serve the ads you see when you visit our Site. These companies may use certain information about your visit to the Site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. The information they use is not personally identifiable information (not, for example, your name, address, email address or telephone number) In the course of serving advertisements on our Site; these third-parties may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your browser. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by SideStep or such, please [click here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy).

  
We also collect information that you input as part of performing searches using the Service, such as flight, hotel, and car rental preferences. This information is linked to your User ID. 

  
When you choose to book a flight, hotel, car or other service after receiving information about the travel product on the Service you will generally be automatically directed to the Web site of the relevant supplier, who will collect and process your payment details. We will monitor your activity on the relevant supplier's Web site to identify if you make a booking, and in doing so we may collect information about your booking (such as name, dates of travel, travel origination and destination, and payment information) which will be linked to your User ID; however, we will not collect credit card information. You should read the privacy policies on each travel supplier's Web site you access. We are not responsible for their use of the personal information you supply to them. 

In some cases, however, we will collect the payment information (the "Transaction Information") on behalf of the relevant supplier, and pass it to them so they can make the booking. This will include credit card information. Other than this one transmission, SideStep does not use your credit card number and does not retain or share your card number with anyone other than the travel provider from whom you are making your purchase. 

  
If you correspond with us in any manner and for any purpose (e.g. emails to customer support), we retain such information in order to evaluate and improve our Service and quality of customer support. 

  
We use the information we collect from you: (a) to facilitate transactions on your behalf, (b) to activate searches on your behalf, (c) to personalize and improve our service offerings to you, and (d) to ensure that we are compensated by our partners. We also use this information in aggregate form to better understand what purchases users want to make and help provide better offers and a more effective service. If you opt to participate, we may use your information in order to offer you personalized services. We may also develop aggregate - but not individual - reports for our partners. An example of a summary report might be "500 users booked travel to a specific city during the month of November." 

  
Your personal information is never sold or rented to any third party. SideStep will not share your personal information with third parties except as described in this section or with your express permission. 

>   * We disclose certain information that we collect to those travel suppliers with whom you decide to book your travel in order to facilitate your purchases. They will use it to book your reservations and process payments (which may involve your information being processed by third parties involved in the payment authentication process). We are not responsible for use of your data by any travel provider or any such third parties. 
>   * We share trend and aggregate information with our partners for business purposes and with other third parties for marketing purposes. We might disclose, for example, that a certain percentage of our users list their home airport as San Francisco. However, this aggregated information is in no way traceable to any specific personal information. 
>   * We disclose information when required by law or judicial authority. 
>   * We disclose information as required to safeguard SideStep's rights or property. 
>   * If SideStep is ever merged with another company, or if SideStep buys, sells or reorganizes some or all part(s) of its business, parties involved in such a transaction would gain access to the information that SideStep has collected over time. Such third parties would be required, however, to adhere to the provisions of this Privacy Policy until such time as it was amended in accordance with the process for modification set forth herein.
