The SideStep travel search engine is a service owned and operated by SideStep, Inc. (“SideStep”). The travel search engine service facilitates your ability to search, compare and purchase travel products and services (such as airline tickets, hotel rooms, and rental cars) from third party suppliers (the “Service”). You can access the Service via our Web site at [www.sidestep.com](http://www.sidestep.com/) (“SideStep Web site” or “Site”) or through the SideStep toolbar software which you download to your web browser (“Toolbar”).

This Privacy Policy applies to information collected from users who access the Service from the Site or the Toolbar.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you of the following: 

  * What kind of information does SideStep collect about you?
  * How will the information that SideStep collects be used?
  * With whom does SideStep share the information it collects about you?
  * What are the opt-out choices SideStep provides you with regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your information?
  * What security procedures does SideStep use to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information collected by the company?
  * How long does SideStep retain information about me?
  * Does SideStep collect information from children?
  * How can I access the information SideStep has about me or correct it?
  * Notification of Changes



SideStep takes the privacy of your personal information very seriously and will use your information only in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. SideStep will not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. However, as described in more detail in Section 4 below, there are limited circumstances when some of your personal information will be shared with third parties, under certain restrictions.

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the SideStep Terms of Service. By using the SideStep Web site and/or the Toolbar you are agreeing to the SideStep Terms of Service and providing your express consent to the use and disclosure of information you provide to SideStep as described in this Privacy Policy.

  
Whenever you use the SideStep Service, we assign a unique number to your computer (“User ID”). The User ID is linked to information about your use of the Service generally, including the searches you perform and the times you choose to click on, and purchase, items searched. The User ID you are assigned is not linked to any personal information and you remain anonymous to the SideStep Service.

  
If you access and use the Service our Web server collects and logs certain standard information about your visit, like the pages you view, the links you click on, and other actions you take when using the Service. We also collect and log certain standard information that your browser communicates to every Web site you visit such as your IP address, the type of browser you are using, and the Web site you came from when you linked to the SideStep Web site.

  
“Cookies” are small files of data that reside on your computer and allow us to recognize you as a user of the Service if you return to the SideStep Web site using the same computer and browser. SideStep uses cookies in several ways. A User ID cookie will be used to track your use of the Service. We place other cookies on your computer to track your use of the Service and the Toolbar, and to ensure that any information delivered is relevant to you. Various temporary session cookies are used each time you access the Service. These only remain on your computer until you close your browser (typically when you next log off). SideStep uses cookies to store information on your computer in order to save you time and effort by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information.

Although browsers typically are pre-configured to accept cookies, you can set your browser to decline cookies or to notify you when they are sent to you by following the relevant instructions that come with your browser software. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to use certain features of the Site and Service that depend on cookies to function properly. You can delete cookies at any time by following the relevant instructions in your browser software.

SideStep has relationships with a number of third-parties who serve the advertisements you see when you visit our Site. These companies may use certain information about your visit to the Site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. The information used in this process is not personally-identifiable to our ad server. In the course of serving ads on our Site, these third-parties may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your browser. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used to target ads to you, please [click here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy).

  
We also collect information that you input as part of performing searches using the Service. When you choose to book a reservation for a travel product after learning about the product on the Service, in most cases the Service will automatically redirect you to the Web site of the relevant supplier, who will collect and process your payment details. We monitor your activity on the supplier's Web site to see if you book a reservation, and in doing so we may collect information about your booking (such as name, dates of travel, travel origination and destination, and payment information; but not credit card information). This information will be linked to your User ID. You should read the privacy policies on each travel supplier's Web site you access. We are not responsible for their use of the personal information you supply to them.

In a limited number of cases, however, SideStep will collect the payment information, including credit card numbers, from you on behalf of the relevant supplier and pass this information on to the supplier so they can book the reservation. SideStep uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption when transmitting any and all payment information from SideStep to suppliers. Anytime you submit credit card information to SideStep it will be SSL encrypted. Other than the transmission of your credit card information to the travel provider with which you are booking your reservation, SideStep does not use your credit card number and does not retain or share your card number with anyone. 

  
If you correspond with us in any manner and for any purpose (e.g. e-mails to customer support), we retain such information in order to evaluate and improve our Service and quality of customer support. 

  
You are always able to use the SideStep Service without providing us with any personal information. If you download the Toolbar software you have the option of setting certain preferences that we can use in order to tailor the operation of the Service and Toolbar for you. If you submit information to SideStep as part of the Toolbar preferences or otherwise, we may combine the information you submit us in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. We also may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. Any preference that you submit to us will be linked to your User ID. We do not share any of this information with third parties. 

  
We use the information that we collect from you in order to: 

>   * provide you with our Service including, without limitation, to personalize and customize the information that we display to you;
>   * improve the Service and to develop new products and services that would interest you;
>   * activate searches on your behalf and to facilitate transactions on your behalf;
>   * ensure that we are compensated by our partners;
>   * contact you;
>   * conduct research; and
>   * generate anonymous reports for internal use and for our external partners.

We also use this information in aggregate form to better understand what purchases users want to make and help provide better offers and a more effective service. We may also develop aggregate - but not individual - reports for our partners. An example of a summary report might be “500 users booked travel to a specific city during the month of November.”

  
SideStep does not rent, sell, disclose or share your personal information with any third parties, except in the following limited circumstances: 

> a. When we have your consent.
> 
> b. We provide certain information that we collect to those travel suppliers with whom you decide to book your travel in order to facilitate your purchases. They will use it to book your reservations and process payments (which may involve your information being processed by third parties involved in the payment authentication process). We are not responsible for use of your data by any travel provider or any such third parties. 
> 
> c. We disclose information when required by law or judicial authority (e.g. to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to protect our legal rights or defend against legal claims).
> 
> d. We may access and/or disclose your personal information if we believe such action is necessary to: (i) comply with the law or legal process; (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of SideStep (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our users or members of the public.
> 
> e. We disclose such information in order to enforce or investigate potential violations of our Terms of Service, or to prevent or take action regarding illegal activities.
> 
> f. If SideStep is ever merged with another company, or if SideStep buys, sells or reorganizes some or all part(s) of its business, parties involved in such a transaction would gain access to the information that SideStep has collected over time. Such third parties would be required, however, to adhere to the provisions of this Privacy Policy until such time as it was amended in accordance with the process for modification set forth herein.

We share trend and aggregate information with our partners for business purposes and with other third parties for marketing purposes.
