We at SideStep respect your privacy and do not sell, rent, or loan any personally identifiable information regarding our customers to any third party. We hold any information you provide with the utmost care and security, and will not use it in ways to which you have not consented.

We are committed to you and your family to make your on-line experience satisfying and safe. If you have registered with SideStep, we will notify you via email of any material change in the use of your personally identifiable information and give you the opportunity to opt-out before that new use goes into effect. We will also prominently post such changes on our website at least 30-days prior to their going into effect. We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy whenever you visit our site or use the SideStep service.

The purpose of this privacy statement is to share with you: 

  1. What kind of information does SideStep collect about you?
  2. How will the information that SideStep collects be used?
  3. With whom does SideStep share the information it collects about you?
  4. What are the opt-out choices SideStep provides you regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your information?
  5. What security procedures does SideStep use to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information under the company? 



1\. What kind of information does SideStep collect about you?

_Name and email address_  
During the SideStep customer registration, you have the option to provide SideStep your name and email address (not mandatory). Your email address may be used, if you have given us permission, to send you information on special promotions and offers. Your email address may be also used to send information about new services, features, and upgrades. You may opt-out of receiving these types of mailings by un-checking the box in the personalization section in your SideStep (click on the  icon). 

_Tell a Friend_  
SideStep is so innovative and powerful that you will want to tell your friends about it. With your permission, we will receive the names and email addresses of friends and send them a one-time email telling them about the benefits of the SideStep service. 

_IP Addresses and Computer Information_  
If you visit the SideStep.com Web site, our Web server logs typical information, including the items below. This information is completely anonymous. This information helps us determine if your computer has the minimum requirements necessary to download the SideStep software and to help us improve the navigation and flow of the Web site. 

  * The URL of the page requested
  * The time and date of the request 
  * The type, version, and configuration of Web browser being used 
  * The type of Operating System being used 
  * The URL of the site where you clicked on a link to get to the SideStep Web site. This URL might contain a code to help identify the specific advertisement clicked on. 
  * The IP address to which a copy of the page you requested is to be sent for display by your browser 



_Cookies_  
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. SideStep does not use cookies on the Web site or on the SideStep service at any time. 

_Transaction Information_  
SideStep collects transaction information such as services purchased, sites used and offers accepted. We collect the information that you provide to the travel companies in the event that you purchase with them, including itinerary information such as name, dates of travel, travel origination and destination, and payment information. We do not collect credit card numbers. 

2\. How will the information SideStep collects be used?

We gather this information in order to facilitate transactions on your behalf, to personalize and improve our service offerings to you and to ensure that we are compensated by our partners. Like any travel service, when you ask us to book travel or make reservations on your behalf, we have to disclose your information to the travel providers that your have selected. Beyond this disclosure, we do not share your information with any third party, except when we believe it is required by law or to safeguard SideStep's rights or property. We also use this information in the aggregate to better understand what purchases customers want to make and help provide better offers and a more effective service. We may offer personalized services for those people who choose to use them. We may also develop aggregate - but not individual - reports for our partners. An example of a summary report might be "500 users booked travel to a specific city during the month of November." We may send email to members with information we think is useful, including information about special offers, new products and services. It is our policy to not send messages to members who have asked us not to do so. Members always have the opportunity to change preferences regarding receipt of email communications by un-checking the box in the personalization section in your SideStep (click on SideStep's  icon). 

3\. With whom does SideStep share the information it collects about you?

Your personal information is never sold, rented or given to a third party. Trend and aggregate data about buyer's habits and SideStep usage is tracked to provide the SideStep user with an increasingly refined product. 

Although unlikely, SideStep may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide personally identifiable information to the appropriate governmental authorities. If requested as part of a legal proceeding, we will provide this information upon receipt of appropriate documentation.

Although SideStep redirects members to other sites, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those Web sites. We do, however, encourage our partners to adopt privacy policies similar to this one.

4\. What are the opt-out choices SideStep provides you regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your information?

If you choose to share personally identifiable information with SideStep, you can control whether we contact you. You may change your mind at any time. You can always change your account information by clicking the "My" button. If there is ever a change to how SideStep uses personally identifiable information, we will post that change to our online Privacy Policy and notify you via email, providing you the opportunity to opt-out.

At any time, you may review and update your personally identifiable information by clicking on the  personalization button from within SideStep. 

SideStep gives members the following opt-out options: 

  * Members may un-check the email box in the personalization dialog (click on SideStep's  icon) to be removed from SideStep emailings regarding new features, services and special offers. 
  * Members may uninstall the client at any time to stop using the SideStep service by selecting "Add/Remove Programs" from the Control Panel. In the dialog box that opens, select SideStep from the menu of applications. After clicking on "SideStep," click on the button that says "Remove."

SideStep may send a one-time registration confirmation email and infrequent service alert messages to our customers to inform you of specific changes that may impact your ability to use the service, regardless of email contact opt-in status. 

5\. What security procedures does SideStep use to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information under the company?

SideStep operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our customers.
