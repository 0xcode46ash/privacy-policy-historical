A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use SidelineSwap products or services that require you to "sign in," and you may not be able to take full advantage of the SidelineSwap service.

SidelineSwap cookies do not collect personal information, and SidelineSwap does not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your username or email address is.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

When you post a message or comment, your SidelineSwap ID or alias is visible to other users. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. SidelineSwap may be required to disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions violate the SidelineSwap Terms of Use. SidelineSwap may disclose personally identifiable information to parties in compliance with SidelineSwap's Copyright and Intellectual Property Policy, as SidelineSwap in SidelineSwap's sole discretion believes necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity. In such events, SidelineSwap may disclose name, street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email address and company name. SidelineSwap may share aggregated demographic information with business partners.

SidelineSwap employs other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and needs to share your information with them to provide products and services to you. Examples include but are not limited to fulfilling orders, handling billing disputes and collections, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance and providing customer service.

SidelineSwap will not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with nonaffiliated parties except as specified in this Privacy Policy to provide products or services you have requested or when SidelineSwap has your permission. It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of SidelineSwap's Terms of Use, as specified in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise required by law. In some cases, SidelineSwap may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. SidelineSwap will transfer information about you if SidelineSwap is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, SidelineSwap will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the SidelineSwap web site before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

As part of the buying and selling process, you may obtain another SidelineSwap user's email address, shipping address and/or other information. Pursuant to SidelineSwap's Terms of Use, you have a limited license to use this information. This information should only be used for SidelineSwap-related communications or for SidelineSwap-facilitated transactions. SidelineSwap has not granted you a license to use the information for unsolicited commercial messages. Without limiting the foregoing, without express consent from the user, you are not licensed to add any SidelineSwap user to your email or physical mail list.

Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and SidelineSwap's ability to keep the community free from bad actors, SidelineSwap will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order, legal process, or substantially similar legal procedure, except when SidelineSwap believes in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to protect SidelineSwap's rights, prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss, or to report suspected illegal activity.

**Third Parties**

Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information SidelineSwap collects from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are buyers or sellers on SidelineSwap or throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. SidelineSwap does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. SidelineSwap is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of other websites on the Internet, even those linked to or from the SidelineSwap's site.
