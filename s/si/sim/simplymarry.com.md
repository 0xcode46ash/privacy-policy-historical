Information that we collect from you:

We gather information from members and guests who apply for the various services our site offers. It includes, but may not be limited to, email address, first name, last name, user-specified password, e-mail Id, mailing address, zip code and telephone number or fax number. 

How we collect and use information:

  * **Information about you-** When you register or subscribe to any of our services, we collect a wide variety of information about you. We collect information from you primarily to ensure that we are able to fulfill your requirements and to deliver personalized experience. We might display your marital status and most recent log-in date and other profile/account information to your matches. Finally, for interactive content and community services such as Advice where you may choose to have a public profile, we may display your information to other visitors. You may choose to provide us with your photo(s) and by providing us such content, you agree that we may make them available to your matches and users of SimplyMarry's services. 
  * **Purchase Information-** To process purchases, we may require your name, address, phone number, email address and credit card information. Such information is used primarily to process your order or as otherwise described herein. SimplyMarry.com is a VeriSign secure site, which ensures complete safety of your online payments and credit card details. 
  * **E-mails and Calls-** We require an e-mail address from you when you register for our services. We use your e-mail for both transactional (e.g., order confirmation, refund and renewal processing, notifying of matches for our Singles service) and promotional (e.g., newsletters, new product offerings, special discounts, event notifications, special third-party offers) purposes. E-mail messages we send you may contain code that enables our database to track your usage of the e-mails, including whether the e-mail was opened and what links (if any) were clicked. We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the SimplyMarry services, such as service announcements and administrative messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. We may also contact you by telephone or text message (including to any wireless number you may provide to us) solely in connection with SimplyMarry's services. 



Disclosure of your information to third parties:

The information collected from our clients is shared only with members of SimplyMarry or members of our partners. Any information you give us is held with the utmost care and security. We are also bound to cooperate fully should a situation arise where we are required by law or legal process to provide information about a customer. 

  * **Disclosure by Law-** You acknowledge and agree that we may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law, 
  * **Disclosure to trusted third parties by us-** We may share your information with third parties, but not in a manner that would reveal your identity and share your information with service providers that may be associated with us to perform functions on our behalf. Your information will be treated as private and confidential by such service providers and not used for any other purpose than we authorize. 
  * **Disclosure to trusted third parties at your request-** When purchasing a SimplyMarry subscription or while visiting our site, we may provide you with advertisements, promotions, sweepstakes and offers from third party providers. If you choose to accept any such offers, you may either (depending on the situation) directly provide your information in connection with the offer to such third party provider, or we will provide your information, including billing information, to the third party provider by pre-populating the offer registration forms. Your information will not be transferred until you actually accept the offer. You may opt-out of the offer at any time up until this point. Please refer to the third party provider's own privacy policy (provided on the offer pages) if you have any questions regarding how your information is used by such providers. Please be aware that these offers may be presented on pages framed by a SimplyMarry website. We do this to provide a seamless experience. Although these offer pages have the look and feel of our websites, you will be submitting your information directly to the third-party advertiser. You agree that we will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings, including the sharing of the information you supply to us with third party providers described here, or as the result of the presence of such providers on SimplyMarry site.
