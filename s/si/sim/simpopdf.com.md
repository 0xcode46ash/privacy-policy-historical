# Simpo Technologies Privacy Policy

Information Collected  
We do not collect any personally identifiable information whatsoever. As is common with many sites, we automatically log certain non-personally identifiable information about visits to our website. This information is used for providing usage statistics, for instance we are interested in who links to us and which of our pages our visitors like to spend time on. We do not collect email addresses and thus we do not sell, rent or disclose email addresses to anyone.

Cookies  
We use cookies to collect aggregate data for statistical analysis. Again, we are interested in information about who links visitors to us and which of our pages our visitors like to spend time on.

Linking to other websites from our site  
We have links to reputable websites on some of our pages in order to provide options to our visitors. When leaving our site to view one of these websites, we encourage you to review their privacy policies as we cannot guarantee the privacy of users while visiting other sites.

Customer Information and Credit Card Transactions  
No personal or credit card information is supplied to this site as we do not sell any of the products we review. All sales are processed via a link to a sales site approved by the software manufacturer. We collect no credit card information and thus no credit card or personal information is sold or distributed to third parties. Almost all of the software products we review use very reputable third party sales outlets (like RegNow or Clickbank who are VeriSign approved sites).

Policy Changes  
Occasional changes may be made to our privacy policy. Visitors are encouraged to check this page periodically to stay informed of current privacy guidelines. Acceptance of Terms: by using our website, you signify your acceptance of this website privacy policy.
