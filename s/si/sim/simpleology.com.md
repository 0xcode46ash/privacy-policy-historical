**What Information Is Collected And How Is It Used?**

Information is collected from users in the following areas of this site:

Registration

 **:** Information is collected from members when they register for Simpleology. In order to create a membership account with us, members are required to provide their first and last name, their email address, and country and postal code. This information is used to:

(a) verify the legitimacy of the registration (for more information, please see “Communications From This Site” below); and

(b) identify the member when they log into the Simpleology Control Panel (where the courses are located), and to customize their experience based on what courses they have purchased; and

(c) geographical information is collected for our own research purposes and is not connected to member’s Personally Identifiable Information following its collection.

2\. Upon registration, members also have the option to subscribe to receive newsletters and communications from [www.simpleology.com](http://www.simpleology.com/). 

[www.simpleology.com](http://www.simpleology.com/)

runs two mailing lists:

  * Simpleology Weekly – our main list to inform members of important events and service announcements; and 
  * Simpleology Daily - a daily service of reminders and motivational information. 



3\. **Support Desk:** Information such as name and email address is required when members submit a ticket to our support desk. This information is required so that the customer care team may respond to that query, and the member may track the progress of their complaint online. The information collected is used solely for purpose of resolving the member’s complaint or query. 

3\. **Refer-a-Friend:** When new members register for Simpleology, we present them with the option of selecting to tell two friends about Simpleology also. If the new member elects to use the Refer-a-Friend service for passing on information about our web site to a friend, we ask the referrer for their friend’s first name and email address for the purpose of sending the friend a one-time email containing a link to our web site. The communication sent via the new member includes an explanation of how the friend came to receive the email and a link to our support desk if they have any concerns. Mark Joyner, Inc stores the information collected via this tool on a log file, but does not use it for any purpose other than to send this one-time email. 

4\. **Discussion Community:**[ www.simpleology.com](http://www.simpleology.com/) runs a Discussion Community. Simpleology members gain instant access to the Community upon registration and may use their Simpleology login details to log into the forum. However, actual participation in the Discussion Community is voluntary.

Members may request to be informed of new posts in a forum thread. Notifications of new posts are delivered by email to the email address provided by the member upon their Simpleology registration. An unsubscribe function is included in this communication in the event the member decides they do not wish to receive such notifications any longer. Forum members may also unsubscribe from threads by using the tools located in their community user profile. To find out more about how to update/correct community profile information, please see ‘Correcting/Updating Information’ section below.

5\. **Testimonial Form:** Mark Joyner, Inc invites all members to post a testimonial about Simpleology using our Testimonial Form located here: 

<http://www.simpleology.com/testimonials.html>

If this verification process is not completed, the Simpleology membership account is not created and the verification link expires and their personal information is discarded from our database after one day

Once the verification process is successfully completed, the new member receives a welcoming email which confirms their membership login details, and supplies a link to the Control Panel and to our support desk.

For every requested communication sent to members (as detailed in 2 above), we include an explanation of how the member came to be on that the mailing list and present an unsubscribe option.

<http://www.simpleology.com/forums/usercp.php>

(To access your profile, you must log in first.)>

**Log Files**

Like most standard web site services, we use log files. The following information is automatically logged by our web site servers upon connection: 

  * IP address

  * Time and date stamp




This information is logged beside your account profile in our system and stored for 14 days, after which it is then discarded from our system. It is therefore is linked to your personally identifiable information.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. It allows information entered in one webpage to be “remembered” when you enter a new webpage.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.

We use session cookies to remember login information entered in our Control Panel area and our Support Suite as you click through our web pages. The session cookie will expire once you logout. If you voluntarily select for our system to “remember” you next time you login, we will set a persistent cookie on your machine in place of the usual session cookie, and this cookie will store your login information and recall it next time you login.

For the **Control Panel** , the persistent cookie simply recalls your login information (i.e. your username and password) and is not linked to your personally identifiable information.

In the **Support Suite** , your email address is used to form the username part of your Support Suite login, therefore both the session and persistent cookies in this section are linked to that personally identifiable information.

On the **Discussion Community** , persistent cookies are used to enable functions such as showing whether or not a thread or forum you are viewing has received new posts since your last visit, or to automatically log you back in when you return to the site after being away for a while. When you register, you are provided with the option to 'Automatically login when you return to the site'. This will store your username and password in a cookie, stored on your computer. If you are using a shared computer, such as in a library, school or internet cafe, or if you have reason to not trust any other users that might use this computer, we do not recommend that you enable this.

The Discussion Community also gives you the option to use a session ID cookie to track your current session, ensuring that you remain logged-on while browsing the site. If you choose not to store this information in a cookie, the session data will be sent through each link you click. Choosing not to use a cookie may cause problems if your computer's connection to the Internet uses a proxy-server and you share links with other users behind the same proxy.

Information about how to clear your forum cookies can be found [ here](http://www.simpleology.com/forums/faq.php?faq=vb_user_maintain#faq_vb_clear_cookies).

If you reject cookies, your ability to use our site will be limited. If your system does not allow cookies for example, you will find that every time you access a new webpage inside our Control Panel, you will be prompted to login again.

Some of our business partners (e.g. agents or service providers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.

**The Discussion Community**

Members should be aware that any personally identifiable information voluntarily submitted to the Discussion Community can be read, collected, or used by other members, and could be used to send unsolicited messages. Mark Joyner, Inc is not responsible for the personally identifiable information members volunteer to this forum.

However, any member found to be obtaining personal information from the Discussion Community and using that information in a manner which is inconsistent with our  [Forum Rules](http://www.simpleology.com/forums/success-stories/announcements.html), will find their membership immediately deactivated.  


**Surveys or Contests**

From time-to-time [www.simpleology.com](http://www.simpleology.com/) may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and therefore you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name, email and/or shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).

We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes.

We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company will be prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.

**Security**

This website takes careful measures to protect member information and prevent the loss and misuse of such information. When you register for Simpleology, your information is encrypted and stored behind a firewall. The website runs regular external and internal audits, and vulnerability and intrusion detection scans. All member information is restricted to Mark Joyner, Inc directors, employees or contractors who are contractually prevented from using such information for any purpose other than what is required to perform their jobs. Information is provided to directors, employees and contractors on a need-to-know basis, and password protection is used to verify the identity of directors, employees and contractors accessing member information. The servers that store your information are located in a secure locked facility.

**Notification of Changes**

If we make any material changes to our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this privacy statement and post a notice on our web site notifying members of the change. If we are going to use members’ information in a manner different from that stated at the time of subscription, we will notify members via email. Members will have a choice whether or not we may use their information in this different manner.
