# SimpleTire

SimpleTire is serious about protecting our customersâ€™ personal information. You can always browse our site without providing any personal information.

While doing business with you, we may have to gather certain information, such as your name, home address, vehicle and email address. We will not sell, rent, trade or give away individual, personally identifiable information entered on this site to any third party. We collect such information so that we can process orders, personalize your shopping experience, or send you the latest product and other useful material. If you do not wish to receive further material from us, you can simply respond to our email or otherwise tell us that you do not want to receive future communications.

###  Online Orders

SimpleTire also collects credit card information from you to process purchases from the site. Reputable third-party financial institutions handle our credit card transactions. Payment authentication processes are live on our site. These programs allow users to set up password authentication for their credit cards. Once they have established a password, they can authenticate themselves using this password at any participating site. The communication regarding Verified by VISA and MasterCard SecureCode passwords is done between the cardholders and their issuing banks utilizing a secure web server. SimpleTire is not involved in any of the communication regarding these passwords.

Whenever you transmit credit card information and other personal information through our site, the numbers and letters are scrambled using encryption technology, making it nearly impossible for the information to be stolen or intercepted. To protect your security, we do not allow you to store your credit card number from session to session.

In addition, SimpleTire's website is SSL Secured. Secured sites must employ encrypted data transmission and a secure online payment infrastructure. The SSL Secured seal indicates that SimpleTire has chosen the very best SSL and/or payment processing solution to help protect credit card and other confidential information and ensures that all online transactions are protected. The SSL Secured seal also validates a website owner's identity and via their official records confirms SimpleTire as a valid business.

###  Cookies

SimpleTire, like most Web sites, uses a feature of your browser to set a "cookie" on your computer. We cannot tell your name or any personal information about you based solely on the cookie. Unless you specifically tell us your name and other identifying information, we will never know who you are. All the cookie tells us is what functions you perform when you are on the site so that we can keep track of your transaction. A cookie also helps SimpleTire note particular traffic patterns on the site so that we can improve what we offer.

Every browser allows you to reject cookies or to choose which cookies you will accept. Rejecting cookies, however, may sometimes interfere with your ability to use all the features and benefits of our site.

###  Third Parties

On occasion, we provide non-personal, aggregate information about our users to third parties such as manufacturers and business partners. For example, we may inform a tire manufacturer about what other products our users buy. This information will not identify any user personally.

You may voluntarily elect to be eligible for the benefits of the Tire Road Hazard Program that SimpleTire makes available to you for your consideration. It will require certain personal information, such as your name, address, phone number, email address, vehicle description, tire description, and Tire Road Hazard Program identification numbers, to administer the Tire Road Hazard Program for you. We will not use this personal information except to administer the Tire Road Hazard Program.

###  Outside Links

SimpleTire may offer links to other sites. Any time you click on a link and are transported to another site, you should be aware that the other site may have a different privacy policy than SimpleTire. We cannot control the policies of other sites.

###  Changes

This privacy policy is subject to change at the sole discretion of SimpleTire. When we modify it, we will post the changes in a revised policy statement.
