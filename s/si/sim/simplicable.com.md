Privacy Policy  
  
Simplicable takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. What This Privacy Policy Covers 

This policy covers how Simplicable treats personal information that Simplicable collects and receives, including information related to your past use of Simplicable products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Simplicable does not own or control, or to people that Simplicable does not employ or manage. In addition, certain Simplicable associated companies have their own privacy statements.  Information Collection and Use General 

Simplicable collects personal information when you register with Simplicable, when you use Simplicable products or services, when you visit Simplicable pages or the pages of certain Simplicable partners. Simplicable may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. Once you register with Simplicable and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. Simplicable collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners, including information about your use of products and services that we offer. Simplicable automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Simplicable cookie information, and the page you request. Simplicable uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.

Information Sharing and Disclosure 

Simplicable does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Simplicable under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Simplicable communicate with you about offers from Simplicable and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Simplicable's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. We transfer information about you if Simplicable is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Simplicable will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. Simplicable displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area. Simplicable does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. Simplicable works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in different industries and categories of business. 

Cookies 

Simplicable may set and access Simplicable cookies on your computer. Simplicable lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Simplicable's cookies. Simplicable uses web beacons to access Simplicable cookies inside and outside our network of web sites and in connection with Simplicable products and services.
