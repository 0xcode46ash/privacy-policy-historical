# Wikisimpsons:Privacy policy - Wikisimpsons, the Simpsons Wiki

[](https://web.archive.org/wiki/File:Clancy_Wiggum.png "That's the law!")

Our site trackers collect information from visitors, including screen resolution, operating system, web browser, visit duration, and location. We use these statistics to better the wiki in every way possible, and we never distribute this information to third parties. [Wikisimpsons](https://web.archive.org/wiki/Wikisimpsons "Wikisimpsons") will not under any circumstances share details about its individual members with any third parties, but reserves the rights to use collected information as a basis for site demographics, which may, in given situations, be proposed to potential advertisers and sponsors. 

  
Note that if you decide to post personal information (age, name, address, etc.) on the wiki, you are doing so at your own risk. Wikisimpsons is not responsible for anything that occurs as a result of posting personal information, and recommends that you not reveal a large amount of personal information. Wikisimpsons may not be held responsible for, or under any circumstances be associated with the opinions expressed by, the content of all editable pages, as these are community endeavors and their directions sometimes make unexpected, and inappropriate, detours from their original intent. 

  
The staff of Wikisimpsons, however, pledges to moderate these pages to the best of its abilities and ensure inappropriate content and opinions are not displayed on the website, as our intentions are to be a web site suitable for people of all ages. In a similar fashion, we cannot be held responsible or directly associated with the advertisements shown at our site, as they are served through a third party network. We will, however, do everything in our power to limit these ads to those which are suitable for people of all ages and, in the event that Wikisimpsons is informed of inappropriate advertising, certainly bring such an issue up with the advertising companies that sponsor it. 

  
If you have any questions regarding Wikisimpsons' privacy policies, please use the [administrators](https://web.archive.org/wiki/Wikisimpsons:Administrators "Wikisimpsons:Administrators") page to get in touch with one of Wikisimpsons' many knowledgeable team members, who will be more than happy to answer them for you.
