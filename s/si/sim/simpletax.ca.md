# SimpleTax: Privacy Policy

We know you are trusting us with some of your most personal and private information. For this reason, your security and privacy are our utmost concern.

### Personally Identifiable Information

When you sign up for a SimpleTax account we ask for your email address and a password. Your email address is the only personally identifiable information that we can access without your password. All other information you provide is encrypted.

### Your Email Address

Your email address will never be sold and will only be used to inform you of product updates and future versions. We will never send you third-party marketing emails. We hate spam just as much as you do.

### Your Data

Your data is yours. We will never, ever, sell it. Other than your email address, [your data is encrypted](https://web.archive.org/blog/2013/how-we-secure-your-data.html) on our servers using your password as the key. This means we cannot unencrypt your data without your password. This also means that if you lose your password, we are not able to recover your account for you. You can delete your account, and all your data, at any time. Removing your data is permanent and there is no undo.

### Third Party Validation

This website has been validated as both secure and authentic by an independent third party. We hold a website identity assurance warranty of $250,000. This means that you are insured for up to $250,000 when relying on the information provided by IdAuthority. You can verify our IdAuthority credentials [here](http://www.trustlogo.com/ttb_searcher/trustlogo?v_querytype=W&v_shortname=SC5&v_search=http://simpletax.ca/&x=6&y=5).

### Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

The connection between you and our application server (app.simpletax.ca) uses high-grade encryption (AES-256, 256 bit keys). We use a Premium SSL certificate from Comodo CA Limited. You can verify the integrity of our certificate using [this SSL checker](http://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html#hostname=app.simpletax.ca).

### Cookies

A cookie is a small amount of data that includes a unique identifier that does not contain any personally identifiable information. Cookies are sent to your browser and are stored on your computer. We use secure session cookies if you sign up for a SimpleTax account. You can safely delete any cookies we transmit after leaving our website.

### Data Storage

Your data is stored in Tier III data centre facilities located in Vancouver and Toronto; in other words, your data lives in Canada. Our hosting partner, Canadian Web Hosting, is 100% Canadian owned and operated and is [SSAE 16 Type II and CSAE 3416 certified](http://www.canadianwebhosting.com/company/SAS70_Certificates.asp).

### Disclosure of Information

We comply with the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). If required by law, we may disclose your encrypted information to law enforcement officials. We are unable to disclose your decrypted information.

### Credit Card Data

If you choose to pay, your credit card details will be tokenized and sent to Stripe, our [secure payments provider](https://stripe.com/help/security). We are [PCI DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/) compliant and we do not store any credit card data on our servers.

### Aggregate Data

We collect aggregate data to improve SimpleTax. This data is collected anonymously and will never include any personally identifiable information; in other words, this data can't be tied back to a person, account, or IP address. For example, when we track the number of times a specific feature gets used, we don't know _who_ used the feature. This data is for internal use only and we will never sell this information.

### Questions or Concerns

Should you have any questions or concerns, or would simply like to better understand the way we do things at SimpleTax, please do not hesitate to [contact us](mailto:hello@simpletax.ca).

We last updated our Privacy Policy on April 10, 2014.
