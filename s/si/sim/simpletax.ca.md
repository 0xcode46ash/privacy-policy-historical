# SimpleTax: Privacy Policy

We know you are trusting us with some of your most personal and private information. Here's how we collect, protect, and use your data.

### Personally Identifiable Information

When you sign up for a SimpleTax account, we'll ask for your email address. Your email address is the only personally identifiable information that we can access without your password. All other information you provide is encrypted.

### Your Email Address

Your email address will never be sold and will only be used to inform you of product updates and future versions. We will never send you third-party marketing emails. We hate spam just as much as you do.

### Data Ownership & Encryption

Your data is yours. We will never, ever, sell it. Other than your email address, [your data is encrypted](https://web.archive.org/blog/2013/how-we-secure-your-data.html) on our servers using your password as the key. You are the only person who can access your account since we can't decrypt your data without your password.

We do not store your password, so keep it in a safe place. If you lose your password, we are not able to reset or recover it for you; we don't have a master key.

You can delete your account, and all your data, at any time.

### SSL/TLS and HSTS

The connection between you and our servers uses high-grade encryption. We use HTTPS across all our services with an Extended Validation (EV) certificate from [DigiCert](https://www.digicert.com/). We also use [HSTS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) to ensure your browser only uses HTTPS. We are on the HSTS preloaded lists for both [Chrome](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/net/http/transport_security_state_static.json) and [Firefox](http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/manager/boot/src/nsSTSPreloadList.inc).

### Cookies

A cookie is a small amount of data that includes a unique identifier that does not contain any personally identifiable information. Cookies are sent to your browser and are stored on your computer. We use secure session cookies if you sign up for a SimpleTax account. You can safely delete any cookies we transmit after leaving our website.

### Data Storage

Your data resides only in Canada. We utilize Tier III data centres located in Vancouver, BC and Halifax, NS. Our hosting partners, [Canadian Web Hosting](https://www.canadianwebhosting.com/) and [Cloud A](https://www.clouda.ca/), are 100% Canadian owned and operated and share our high-standards for security and privacy.

### Disclosure of Information

We comply with the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). If required by law, we may disclose your information, in its encrypted form, to law enforcement officials. We are unable to disclose your decrypted information.

### Credit Card Data

If you choose to pay, your credit card details will be tokenized and sent to Stripe, our [secure payments provider](https://stripe.com/help/security). We are [PCI DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/) compliant and we do not store any credit card data on our servers.

### Diagnostic and Usage Data

We collect diagnostic and usage data to improve SimpleTax. The data is for internal use only and we will never sell this information. We collect almost all data anonymously. For example, when we track the number of times a specific feature gets used, we don't know who used that feature. If an error is detected, we may associate your account with that error so we can notify you if required.

### Questions or Concerns

Should you have any questions or concerns, or would simply like to better understand the way we do things at SimpleTax, please don't hesitate to [contact us](mailto:hello@simpletax.ca).

We last updated our Privacy Policy on February 8, 2015.
