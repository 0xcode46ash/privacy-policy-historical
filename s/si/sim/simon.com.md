# Your Privacy

### Therefore, hereinafter, and all that stuff…

Last Updated: August 28, 2013

This Privacy Policy sets out the privacy practices of the website located at [simon.com](http://www.simon.com/) and [www.simon.com](http://www.simon.com/) (herein referred to as the "Website") which is owned and operated by Simon Property Group, L.P. and its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, “Simon”). Specifically, it outlines the types of information that Simon gathers about you while you are using the Website, and the ways in which Simon uses and shares this information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you may provide to Simon, or that Simon may collect, offline and/or through other means (for example, at a live event or through the mail). As used herein, the words "user," "you" and "your" mean users of the Website and the words "we" and "our" means Simon.

**Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting and using the Website, you agree that your use of the Website, and any dispute over Simon’s online privacy practices, is governed by this Privacy Policy and our[Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/legal).** Because the web is an evolving medium, Simon may need to change the Privacy Policy from time to time, in which case we will post the revised Privacy Policy on the Website and update the "Last Updated" date to reflect the date of the changes. **By continuing to use the Website after we post any such changes, you accept the[Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/legal) & Privacy Policy as modified. If you do not agree to such changes, you should discontinue using the Website.**

### Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable Information

We do not collect any personally identifiable information about you on the Website (such as your name, address, mobile phone number or email address) unless you provide it.

You must provide personally identifiable information in order to use, or participate in, certain optional features of the Website, including, but not limited to, Simon Giftcard® purchases, retailer gift card purchases, gift card registrations, gift card balance checks, finding a nearby mall with the use of your latitude/longitude geo-coordinates that your mobile device or browser provides, using the free in-mall Wi-Fi network, e-mail alerts (aka the Mall Insider® program), mobile SMS alerts (aka the Mobile Shopper Club®), coupons, instant wins and sweepstakes. The manner in which we will use this information, if any, will be disclosed on the page through which you sign up for, or otherwise provide information to use, or participate in, the applicable feature. For the avoidance of doubt, we will not share or use your mobile number for any other purpose than to send you mobile SMS alerts, in accordance with carrier and Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) guidelines.

When you complete forms online or otherwise provide us information in connection with a program, you agree to provide accurate, complete and true information. You agree not to use a false or misleading name or a name that you are not authorized to use. If we, in our sole discretion, believe that any such information is untrue, inaccurate or incomplete, we may prohibit you from further participation in the applicable program and pursue any appropriate legal remedies.

Except as expressly set out in this Privacy Policy, or as disclosed when you sign up for, or otherwise provide information to use, or participate in, an optional feature on the Website, we will not disclose any personally identifiable information to a third party without your express prior authorization, nor will we use that information for any purpose other than to provide the applicable feature. However, we reserve the right at all times to disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any law, regulation or governmental request, to avoid liability, or to protect our rights or property.

### Collection and Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information

In some cases, when you visit the Website, we and/or specific third parties authorized by Simon may collect and store non-personally identifiable (anonymous or “non-PII”) information about you which is generated automatically through your use of the Website, such as, but not limited to your IP address (a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web), your MAC address (a unique number that is assigned to your network card by the manufacture), your browser type or your operating system and a randomly assigned, unique user identification number (UID). This information, by itself, cannot be used to identify you.

We use this information to create "aggregate data" reports that we may disclose to third parties, including entities with whom we have entered into an agreement to provide such information. We may also study aggregate data in order to enhance our existing services or develop new services and use non-personally identifiable information to enable Simon or a third party to provide you with information about products and services while you are using the Website.

Additionally, we may occasionally use third-party advertising companies and advertising networks to serve ads to you on our behalf when you visit the Website. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information about your visits to this Website and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and how to opt-out of receiving communications from these third-party advertising companies, please visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>

We can and will use IP addresses and/or MAC address to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/legal) or to protect the Website, customers, or other individuals. We also reserve the right to use or disclose non-personally identifiable information in any manner we see fit in order to improve the Website.

### Use of Browser Based Cookies and Web Beacons

Simon uses browser-based cookies, which are small text files placed on your computer's hard drive, as well as web beacons (also known as pixel tags), which are electronic images embedded into a web page, on the Website.

Cookies and web beacons are used for record keeping, to track your movements when you visit the Website and to help Simon and our authorized third party analytics vendors to determine what type of information to present to you. The use of cookies and web beacons is an industry standard practice used at most websites and can enhance a user’s experience on a website. Simon’s cookies and web beacons do not contain personally identifiable information, and do not damage or alter your system files.

The first time you visit the Website, Simon assigns you a unique, anonymous ID, which is stored in the cookie file on your computer. Although you can choose not to accept cookies through a setting on most browsers (which can also be set to notify you each time a cookie is set), if you choose to refuse cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features of the Website.

### Retention of Information

Any information we collect may be retained for an indeterminate period of time.

### Confidentiality and Security

Simon is committed to protecting the security of the information collected from users of the Website and has implemented generally accepted standards of technology security in order to protect information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. However, it is not possible to guarantee the security or integrity of information disclosed online because no data transmission over the Internet is completely secure. In addition, Simon may use a third party service provider or providers to process credit card transactions and fulfill online orders, which service provider(s) may share information and credit card number with a ticket agent, a credit card processing company, an issuing bank, the card network issuer and/or a shipping/fulfillment company in order to complete an order.

We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personally identifiable information when you are on the Internet. If a password is used to help protect that information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. If you are sharing a computer with anyone, we suggest you log out before leaving a site or service in order to protect subsequent users from gaining access to your information and decline to have your Internet browser remember your password.

Because no physical or electronic security is impenetrable, by using the Website or emailing information to Simon, you agree to assume all risk in connection with that information.

### Links to Other Sites

The Website may contain links to third party websites. Please be aware that, when you click on such a link, you will leave the Website and are no longer subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Simon is not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites or third party service providers, and does not control, or endorse, the third party website or its privacy policy. This Privacy Policy also does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Simon’s control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation.

### Children's Privacy Statement

This section explains our practices with respect to the online collection and use of personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, and provides important information regarding their rights under federal law with respect to such information.

  * The Website is not directed to children under the age of 13 and we do NOT knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 as part of the Website, nor do we knowingly distribute such information to third parties.
  * We screen users who wish to provide personally identifiable information in order to prevent users under the age of 13 from providing such information. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of 13, we will take the appropriate steps to delete such information from our records.
  * We do NOT knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable information through the Website.
  * Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 via the Website, we do NOT condition the participation of a child under 13 in the Website's online activities on providing personally identifiable information.



### Changes to this Privacy Policy

All versions of the Privacy Policy are dated with the effective date of that version of the Privacy Policy (i.e., the date on which the applicable version of the Privacy Policy was posted to the Website). Simon’s use of information it learns about you will be governed by the most recent Privacy Policy in effect.

### Disclosure Required By Law

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose information, including, without limitation, personally identifiable information, as required by law, rule or regulation, and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, request by a governmental or law enforcement authority or other legal process. This disclosure may also include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction, to report any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement for investigation or prosecution and/or in connection with legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) rights or property of Simon and/or the rights or property of any third party. We reserve the right to release information concerning any user of the Website when that user is in violation of our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/legal) or other published guidelines or partakes (or is reasonably suspected of partaking) in any illegal activity.

If Simon sells assets (or the assets of a division or subsidiary) to another entity or if Simon is acquired by or merged with another entity, you agree that, without obtaining your consent, Simon may provide and transfer to such entity information about users of the Website, including your personal and non-personal information, that is related to that part of our business that was sold to or merged with the other entity. However, we will take steps to assure that any personally identifiable information is used in a manner consistent with the Privacy Policy under which it was collected.
