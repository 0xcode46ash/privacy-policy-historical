Effective date May 17, 2003.

At Simon.com, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner. 

As part of the normal operation of our services, Simon.com collects and, in some cases, discloses information about you. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect about you and what may happen to that information. Please read on. 

What Information Do We Collect?  
In order to use certain services provided on the site, you will need to register with Simon.com. When you register, we will gather such information as your name, mailing address and email address, and demographic information, such as zip code, age, or income level. If you make a purchase, we may also ask you for your credit card information to process your order. This information will not be used for any other purpose than order processing and/or referencing of your order and will not be shared with anyone outside of Simon Property Group. We may also track certain information about how you use our website.

Simon.com uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. With both cookies and Spotlight technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to [ http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy).

Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with an efficient and customized experience while using our services. This allows us to enhance your online shopping experience, by providing products and services that meet your particular needs, and making your use of our website more satisfying.

We use your information in a number of ways. For example, we conduct internal research on our user's demographics, interests, and site usage, to better understand and service you.

We may share user information with businesses affiliated with Simon.com and Simon Property Group. They may use this information as we would, and you may occasionally receive product and service information from them.

We may also use your information to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests. If you do not wish to receive email from us, please let us know by sending an email to unsubscribe@simon.com or writing to us at the above address. In the future, we may make our email address list available to carefully screened companies whose products may be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive email from other companies, please let us know this as well.

In addition, we may share user information with third parties that we believe are reputable in order to offer products and services that may be of interest to you.

Finally, we may share user information with outside vendors and organizations that provide support services to us or that help us with our marketing programs.

At no time will we share credit card or social security numbers in any fashion other than aggregate demographic information, or as required by law.

What About "Cookies?"  
A "cookie" is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive, containing information about the user. We use cookies on our site, but none of them contain any personally identifiable information. Some of our business partners also use cookies on our site, for example, in connection with their advertising. We have no control over these cookies, and we may not have access to the information these advertisers collect. You may choose not to accept cookies by setting your browser to refuse all cookies or to notify you each time a cookie is set. If you choose to refuse cookies, however, you may not be able to use all features of our site.
