SimuTech Group respects your right to privacy. This policy summarizes what personally identifiable information we may collect, and how we might use this information.

SimuTech Group will only collect personally identifiable information (such as name, title, company name, address, telephone/fax number or e-mail address) that you voluntarily provide through our web site or e-mail correspondence. We do not use techniques that collect personal information about you without your knowledge.

**How We Use Non-Personal Information**

The Internet domain for your Internet service provider, such as "company.com" or "service.ca" and the IP address of the computer accessing the Web site, such as " PPP -55";

The type of browser (such as "Netscape version x" or "internet Explorer version x") you are using;

The type of operating system you are using (such as Macintosh, Unix or Windows);

The date and time you visit our site and the Web pages that you visit on our site, along with the address of the previous Web site you were visiting, if you linked to us from another Web site.

SimuTech Group uses this information for statistical analysis, to help us make our site more useful to visitors. This tracking system does not record personal information about individuals or link this information to any personal data collected.

Before we collect any personally identifiable information, we will provide an explanation for the possible use of your data.

The goal is to save you time and provide you with a more meaningful visit and to measure Web site activity. Cookies do not contain any personally identifying information. Browsers such as Netscape allow you to disable cookie collection if you wish, or inform you when a cookie is being stored on your hard drive.

**What About Spam?**

From time to time we may use e-mail as a way to keep in touch with our existing customers and other interested individuals.

We don't sell any personal information to anyone else or use it outside of ourselves and our affiliated entities. Any request to "unsubscribe" will be promptly honored.

This policy discloses the privacy practices for our Web site.

However, our site contains links to other sites. Once you link to another site, you are subject to the privacy and security policies of the new site. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of all Web sites you visit, especially if you share any personal information.
