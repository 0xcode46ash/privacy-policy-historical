# SimDynasty values your privacy and is dedicated to protecting your personal information

SimDynasty values your privacy and is dedicated to protecting your personal information. Following is a listing of what you will find in our privacy policy:

  * The types of information we collect
  * How we collect information
  * How we use information
  * Who else has access to your information


  * How to control the e-mails you receive from us by visiting the [My Profile](http://www.simdynasty.com/userpref.jsp) page


  * How to see and correct the information we have about you


  * How we protect your information



Following is a complete description of our privacy practices.

The information we collect is broken down into three major categories.

_Anonymous data_ is information that is not linked to you personally and is not used to track you individually in any way. It includes such things as:

  * The number of people visiting our site
  * The times when people visit
  * How long they stay
  * How many pages they look at
  * A visitor�s IP address and browser type
  * The URL a visitor was referred from



For example, we might know that someone using Internet Explorer 6.0 with an IP address of 207.422.281.51 came to us at 10:00 p.m. on March 19th from a specific sports website, stayed for 5 minutes and viewed our Home Page and Rule Book. This information does not identify you personally and it is not linked to any of your personal information such as your name or address.

_Personal data_ is anything that identifies you personally, such as your:

  * Name
  * Address
  * Telephone number
  * E-mail address
  * User name



_Aggregate data_. Sometimes we combine personal data about our customers so we can learn more about them. For example, we might prepare a report analyzing how many of our customers live in the U.S. or how many have played more than 5 seasons. When we aggregate data, we never identify individual users � so we would report on how many people live in the U.S., but not who those individuals are.

There are a number of different ways that a web site can collect information. This section briefly describes these collection methods and how SimDynasty uses them.

_Log Files_ are records that we create automatically when somebody visits our web site. Our log files only collect anonymous data; nothing in our log files identifies you personally. Although some web sites combine the information from their log files with personal data they collect about you, SimDynasty does not do this. We do not link any of the anonymous data from our log files with any personal data you provide to us.

_Cookies_ are tiny text files placed onto your computer�s hard drive when you visit a site. Most major web sites use cookies; they allow a site to recognize your computer when you return. It might help to think of a cookie as an ID number for your computer. A cookie file usually looks something like this: ID=62q3f585c17cd0748d8032gf0baf1eb3.

By themselves, cookies generally don�t do much of anything. However, a web site can link the cookie on your machine to other information it has about you. Cookies can be very helpful, doing things like remembering your login ID and password, customizing the information you see on the site or remembering the address where you want orders delivered.

There are two types of cookies: first-party cookies and third-party cookies. When the site you visit places a cookie on your machine, it is a first-party cookie. Sometimes a web site hires another company to serve advertisements, count site visitors or operate a message board. If those other companies place cookies on your machine, they are third-party cookies.

In order to keep down the cost of owning a team, we may use outside companies to place banner ads on the SimDynasty site. These companies often use third-party cookies to help track and measure these advertisements. SimDynasty also uses first-party cookies to remember your ID and password; see below for more details on what we use first and third party cookies for.

_Beacon GIFs_ are also known as 1x1 pixels, clear GIFs, web bugs and web beacons. Beacon GIFs are images on a web site that are downloaded from somewhere other than the site you�re visiting. While you retrieve the image from this third-party web site, that site can record:

  * Your IP address
  * Your browser type
  * Any cookie the third-party site previously placed on your machine
  * The web page you are on
  * The image you are retrieving



The companies that serve our advertisements may uses beacon GIFs to help track and measure the ads they place; see below for more details on what they use beacon GIFs for.

_Registration form_. You must register to play SimDynasty. The form to do so asks for some mandatory information and other information that is optional. We require you to provide your name, e-mail address and Zip code. You must also select a user name and password. If you are joining a dynasty league that requires payment, we require the necessary information for your credit card or PayPal account. We also ask you for your address and telephone number, but this information is optional.

When you register, you can indicate whether or not you want to receive special offers or be contacted about league news. You also have the option to allow other members to see your e-mail address. Owners are only permitted to use these e-mail addresses for offering trades and other SimDynasty business. Any use of these addresses for anything other than SimDynasty business is strictly prohibited. Violators will receive one warning and then be expelled from the league. Please note that if you choose to reveal your information to other owners, SimDynasty is not responsible for violations of this policy. You can always update your contact preferences by visiting the [My Profile](http://www.simdynasty.com/userpref.jsp) page.

After billing you, we delete your credit card number from our records so that it is not accidentally exposed or we store it in an off-line database that is not accessible through the Internet.
