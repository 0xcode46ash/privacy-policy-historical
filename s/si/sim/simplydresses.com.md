**PRIVACY POLICY**

Simplydresses.com respects your privacy! However, we do collect customer information in an effort to improve your shopping experience. We recognize we must maintain and use customer information responsibly. 

**What personally identifiable information is collected and how is it used?**

We ask users to register on Simplydresses.com in order to make a purchase, receive Simplydresses.com's monthly mailings or access the site's message board. The following information is required for registration: first and last name, E-mail address, and password. 

When you make a purchase, we require that you also provide your shipping and billing address, phone number and credit card information (if paying by credit card). This information is stored in a secured database, only accessible to employees with access rights to this information. Simplydresses.com makes every effort to protect your online order information using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. (Details are provided in the next section.) 

Additionally, Simplydresses.com logs your Internet Protocol Address (IP). An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your PC every time you browse the Internet. Information from IP addresses is used for system administration, to examine overall traffic trends, troubleshooting, etc. This information is used only in the aggregate form. IP addresses are not linked to any personally identifiable information, meaning the user session is tracked but the user is anonymous. 

**How secure is transaction information?**

Your information is secure with Simplydresses.com! Protecting your order information is a priority. Promgirl.com makes every effort to protect your online order information using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. 

SSL encrypts your order information to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone other than [Simplydresses.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20060412195402id_/http%3A//www.simplydresses.com/info/www.simplydresses.com). To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active. You can also double check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https". 

Some versions of firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers. In that case, you will be unable to connect to the server (and you won't have to worry about placing an order through an unsecured connection). 

If you cannot access a secure server for any reason, please feel free to use our offline order form available upon check out, or place your order by phone.
