**Information Collection**  
Simplicity.com collects information from our users at several different points on our web site. For example, we receive and store any information you enter on our web site or give us in any other way. You do not have to give us certain information, but then you might not be able to use all of the benefits of our web site. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing your future shopping, improving our stores, and communicating with you.

We also collect and store information based on your interaction with us using "cookies". Finally, we may receive information about you from a third party source. If we do, we may add it to our account information about you.

**IP Address**  
We log all connections to our web servers. Those log files include your IP address. An IP address is NOT personally identifiable information, but general information about your location, connection to the Internet, and your Internet Service Provider. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the site.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about their computer. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. So, while the user session will be tracked to give us an idea of what parts of the site a user is visiting, the user will remain anonymous. If a user rejects cookies, they may still use our site. 

We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once a user closes the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of time. We may use cookies to: 

  * Keep count of your return visits to our site 
  * Accumulate and report anonymous, aggregate, statistical information on web site usage 
  * Deliver content specific to your interests 



We do not use cookies to identify, monitor or track any personally identifiable information. Our cookies in and of themselves will not contain any personally identifiable information about you. We do not merge or associate our cookie information with any personally identifiable information we obtain.

**Log Files**  
Like most standard web site servers, we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. This information is not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Links**  
Simplicity web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site, [www.simplicity.com](http://www.simplicity.com/).

**Notification of Changes**  
We will notify all users if there are any material changes to our privacy policy. We will take commercially reasonable measures to obtain written or active email consent from the user if Simplicity.com is going to be using the information collected from the user in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection.
