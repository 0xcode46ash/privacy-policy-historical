# SimplePlanes | Privacy Policy

## Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us and this is how we manage and use your data. 

#### What information we collect

**Registration information**   
When you create an account, you are required to provide a username and password and optionally provide an email address. We also log, and retain indefinitely, the IP address from which the account is initially created. 

**Airplanes, comments, and ratings**  
The airplanes, comments, and ratings you post on SimplePlanes.com are not private and will still be accessible if your account is deleted. The IP address associated with an airplane, comment, or rating is logged indefinitely. 

#### How we use your information

**Your information is not for sale**  
We only share your personal information with your consent, and after letting you konw what information will be shared and with whom, unless it is otherwise permitted in this policy. 

**We will not disclose your information unless required by law**  
We may disclose – or preserve for future disclosure – your information if we believe, after due consideration, that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, or valid legal process. 

#### Cookie Policy

Cookies are small data files placed on your computer by websites you visit in order to help them remember certain information about you. We set only a few cookies for tracking authentication and collecting anonymous analytics data.

**Authentication Cookies**  
When you log into your account, SimplePlanes.com will place a cookie for the sole purpose of creating this session. It contains your user id and hashed authentication information. 

**Analytics Cookies**  
We use a tool called Google Analytics to help us understand how users interact with our website. It tells us aggregate usage and traffic information, such as how the site was accessed, how long visitors stayed, and the number of first-time visitors to the site. By knowing how people use the site, we can make it better. To learn more about Google Analytics and how it uses your data, please visit http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html. 

#### Account Deletion

You may delete your account at anytime by contacting Jundroo, LLC. The username associated with your account will be removed for others to use. However, any content you have submitted will still be publicly available, though your username will no longer be associated with that content.

#### Data Security

Every effort will be made to secure any private information submitted to us by our users. However, no data transmission over the internet is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of this data. You use the service at your own risk, and are responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account (such as carefully maintaining the secrecy of your password). 

#### Children under 13

Although we welcome users from all walks of life, SimplePlanes.com is not aimed at children, and the United States government has put limits on our ability to accept users under a certain age through the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Individuals under the age of 13 may not create an account with us. If you believe someone 12 or younger is using our site without parental consent, please contact us. 

#### Changes to this policy

We reserve the right to change this policy to meet changing needs, or for any other reason. Changes may only be highlighted by the privacy policy link in the footer of our website.

We welcome questions, concerns, and feedback about this policy. Please feel free to [contact us](http://jundroo.com/about/).
