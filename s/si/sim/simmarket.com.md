**Data Protection Declaration**

We take the protection of your personal data very seriously. Therefore, we shall inform you in this declaration about which personal data we collect and how we process and utilise them. Of course, we collect and utilise your personal data exclusively within the context of the provisions of data protection law of the Federal Republic of Germany. This data protection declaration applies to all services that we offer on the German-speaking pages of simmarket.com. 

**1 Responsible body**

The responsible body within the meaning of the German Federal Data Protection Act is simFlight GmbH, Kisdorfer Weg 15b, D-24568 Kaltenkirchen, email: sales@simmarket.com ("simMarket" or "we"). Should you have any questions or suggestions regarding data protection, please feel free to contact us by email. 

**2 Subject of data protection**

The subject of the data protection is personal data. Pursuant to section 3 (1) of the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) this is individual details about personal or material conditions of a certain or identifiable natural person. This includes, for example, details such as name, postal address, email address or telephone number, but if applicable also usage data. Usage data is data which is required to use our websites, e.g. information on the start, end and scope of use of our website and log-in data.

**3 Collection, processing and usage of your personal data**

3.1 When you place an order with us, we have to ask for your name, email address, billing and delivery address, sort code and account number or your credit card number and the expiry date of the credit card. We collect, store and utilise this data in order to process and execute your order and keep you up to date on your order status. 

3.2 To process payments we forward your name, billing and delivery address, account number and sort code or, in the case of payment by credit card, your credit card number and the expiry date of your credit card to our house bank or our payment service provider [...].

3.3 simMarket offers you a free newsletter service. On request we inform you with the newsletter about special offers, new publications and similar promotions of simMarket. To receive the newsletter we need your email address. You can unsubscribe to the newsletter at any time. Information on this is contained in each newsletter.

3.4 Furthermore, simMarket offers you the chance to obtain personal shopping recommendations by storing and using the data from your purchase. 

3.5 If, as a customer, you wish to write an online review, then please specify your email address for security reasons. Your email address will not be published with your review unless you have given your consent thereto. 

3.6 In the case of payment on account we review and evaluate the data you have provided. If there is justifiable reason, we exchange data with other companies within the simFlight network and credit reporting agencies. The result of this review will only have an effect on the method of payment, not the delivery per se. 

3.7 When accessing our websites your internet browser automatically transmits data for technical reasons. The following data is stored separately from the other data that you may send us: date and time of access, browser type/version, operating system used, URL of the previously visited website, volume of data sent. We store this data anonymously so that we cannot link it to individual visitors. We use this anonymous data to improve the appearance and structure of our range of products.

**5 Use of Facebook plugins**

Our websites use plugins for the social networking site facebook.com, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook"). You can identify the Facebook plugins by their respective Facebook logo or the additional "Recommend", "Like" or "Comment" buttons. 

Just by visiting our website, your internet browser will not establish a direct connection to the servers of the social networks or transfer data. The "Like" button becomes active only after hovering over it with the cursor and upon clicking on it after a pop-up message informs you that the "Like" button will only be activated once you click on it. After that, you may post a recommendation by clicking on it. After clicking the "Like" button, various data is sent to Facebook. This may include:

Date and time of accessing the website

URL of the website the visitor is currently on

URL of the website previously accessed by the visitor

Browser type used

Operating system used

IP address of the visitor

If you are logged in to Facebook while visiting our website, it cannot be ruled out that Facebook may link the visit to your network account. If you use plugin features (e.g. clicking the "Like" button or leaving a comment), this information will likewise be directly transmitted to the respective social network by your browser and potentially stored there. The purpose and extent of this data collection and the further processing and usage of the data by the networks can be found in the data protection policies of Facebook [http://www.facebook.com/policy.php].

**6 "AddThis" bookmarking service**

This website contains "AddThis" buttons which enable you to set bookmarks or share interesting website content in the social web (e.g. Facebook, Twitter). This service uses the cookies described above in subsection 4. The generated data (such as time of use or browser language) will be transmitted to AddThis LLC in the U.S. and processed there.

Further information on data processing by AddThis LLC and AddThis LLC's Privacy Policy can be found at www.addthis.com/privacy. This website especially contains information on the nature of the processed data and its use. This data will not be processed by us. 

With the use of the "AddThis" button, you agree to the data processing by AddThis LLC on the scale shown on the website www.addthis.com. You can object to the use of your data at any time with "opt-out cookies." Further details can also be obtained from the aforementioned AddThis LLC website.
