**COLLECTION OF INFORMATION**

Information We Collect for SimpleReach’s Own Business Purposes

 ** _Whose information we collect_**

SimpleReach may collect information about individuals who interact with SimpleReach when using our website or services (such as employees of our customers), job applicants, and other individuals.

 ** _How we collect the information_**

We may collect information:

• Directly from individuals

• From our customers, regarding their employees or authorized users

• From recruiters

 ** _Types of information we collect_**

The types of information we collect include:

• Personal and business contact information (such as name, business name, address, telephone number, email address, and mailing address)

• Payment information (such as credit card or other financial account numbers)

 **Information We Collect from or on Behalf of Our Customers**

SimpleReach provides marketing analytics services to other businesses – our customers.  To take advantage of our services, our customers install our technology on their websites, which enables us to collect certain information regarding individuals’ visits to our customers’ websites. We analyze the personal information that we obtain only at the direction of our customer, and only on that customer’s behalf.

We may collect information about individuals who visit the digital media properties that have installed our technology at the direction of our customers (“end users”). SimpleReach, Inc. collects information under the direction of its customers on certain digital media properties. SimpleReach has no direct relationship with its customers’ end users. Our customers determine the scope of the information we receive, and the information we receive may vary by customer. If you are a customer of one of our customers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our customers that use our service, please contact the company that you interact with directly. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers.

Typically, when end users access our customers’ webpages, we automatically collect information about end users’ devices, as described further in the section titled “Cookies and Other Information Collected by Automated Means.” 

We acknowledge that you have the right to access your personal information. SimpleReach has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the relevant customer of SimpleReach’s (the data controller). If requested to remove data we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.

We will retain personal data we process on behalf of our customers for as long as needed to provide services to our customers. SimpleReach will retain this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

COOKIES AND OTHER INFORMATION COLLECTED BY AUTOMATED MEANS

We, our service providers, and our business partners, may collect certain information about the use of our websites by automated means, such as cookies, or similar technologies. Likewise, as part of our services, we may offer our customers the ability to install these types of technologies on their websites; and if a customer does so, we collect information on its behalf. 

A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor‘s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. We use both “session” and “persistent” cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track various types of information on our website and on our customers’ websites. A session cookie is one that disappears after you close your browser. While a persistent cookie remains after you close your browser (and may be used by your browser when you later return to the Service), persistent cookies generally can be removed. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, is used to transmit information back to a web server. Web browsers may offer individuals the ability to disable receiving certain types of cookies; however, if cookies are disabled, some features or functionality of our websites or our customers’ websites may not function correctly. We and our service providers and business partners may collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites when you use our websites.

Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based do-not-track (“DNT”) mechanisms, we do not respond to web browser-based DNT signals at this time. Please see the “Privacy Preferences, Rights and Choices” section below for information about how you may opt out of, or limit the use of, your browsing behavior for online behavioral advertising purposes.

The information we collect by automated means varies based on whether we are collecting information for our own business purposes or whether we are collecting information from or on behalf of our customers to provide our services.

 **Automated Data Collection for SimpleReach’s Own Business Purposes**

The information collected by automated means for our own business purposes includes:

• Details about the devices that are used to access our websites (such as the IP address, and type of operating system and web browser)

• Dates and times of visits to, and use of, our websites

• Information about how our websites are used (such as the content that is viewed on our websites, how users navigate on and between our webpages, and the date and time of access)

• Details about how individuals interact with our emails (such as whether the email is opened and which links are clicked in the email) 

• URLs that refer visitors to our websites

• Search terms used to reach our websites

 **Automated Data Collection on Behalf of Our Customers**

The information collected by automated means on behalf of our customers includes:
