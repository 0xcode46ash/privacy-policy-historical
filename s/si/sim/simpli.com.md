The Internet contains a wealth of information, unfortunately, it may also contain personal details about you that you don't want everyone to know. For example, your real name (lots of people on the Internet use aliases, alter egos or nicknames), street address, phone number, or e-mail address. When you go online, sites you visit may be gathering information about you without your knowledge. At Simpli.com we strive to help our customers protect their privacy while using our services.

We are constantly striving to provide excellent service to you, our customers and business partners, while building a long lasting relationship with you. To achieve these goals, we occasionally need information about you when you visit our site.

First and foremost, Simpli.com respects your right to privacy. When you visit Simpli.com, you may be providing information to us on a number of different levels about your visit:
