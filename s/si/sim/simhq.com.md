Site History

Since 1997, SimHQ has existed for one purpose... providing the simulation community with the best articles, news, message boards, and tips to make our common passion more enjoyable. What started out as one man’s personal website has quickly risen to become the community’s leader for sim information.

This didn’t happen by accident… it took dedicated volunteers, the support of our readers, and a continuing desire to be the best. If you’re new to SimHQ, take a look at our Staff Bios. Here you’ll see one of the things that set us apart. Many of our writers not only have “been there and done that” around the world, but continue pushing the envelope today. They are our inspiration and our ‘reality check’ that we are, after all, gaming, but their deep knowledge of the topics they write about shines through in their articles.

Another ‘SimHQ difference’ is our technical knowledge. We’re all tinkerers….the kind of people who understand what makes our PCs tick, and who always seek to make our sims run the fastest, most stable, and with the highest quality that it can. Several of our staff either currently work for the world’s leading technology companies, or have in the past. We’re the best of both worlds…a site focused on simulations, but deeply interested in the hardware that makes it happen.

Lastly, SimHQ staff are here for a simple reason….the freedom to tell it like it is. Many of us have written for other commercial or fan sites, and the experience hasn’t always been a good one. That desire to be accurate, truthful, and respectable comes through in any of our articles, and it’s the core of our Pledge to our Readers. Check the pledge out, and think about it the next time you’re reading an article trying to decide whether to spend your hard-earned money on a software title or piece of hardware. We mean what we say, and for good reason.

If you’re a long-time SimHQ reader, you already know all of this, and hopefully have seen it in action. If you’re new to our site, welcome, and thanks for choosing us. Be sure to read our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page to learn more about the history and current operations of the site, and please drop us a line if you have any suggestions, comments, or questions!
