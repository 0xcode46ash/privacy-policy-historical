For questions about this policy, please [**contact us**](mailto:comments@simhq.com).  
  
### The trust of the simming community is essential to the success of SimHQ.com.    
Therefore, we take concerns regarding privacy very seriously.  

**_What Information Does SimHQ.com Collect On Its Traffic?  
_**We collect general site server statistical information from all visitors to SimHQ.com, both to monitor utilization and for site security purposes.  While this information contains such features as the machine (IP) address you are using, as well as the date, time, and file(s) requested, it typically cannot be used to identify you on an individual basis.  Specifically, our tracking software logs the following:

  * Web Browser Used
  * Operating System Used
  * Visitors Top Level Domain (i.e. aol.com)
  * Full Server Address
  * Visitor IP Address
  * Links that brought a visitor to SimHQ.com
  * Links followed from SimHQ.com
  * Hits to local documents and files
  * Hits by time, day, week, and year



You can tell this data is being collected from links we use to outside sites by noticing the addition of "http://www.simhq.com/cgi-bin/ax.cgi?" in the URL of the link.  This same program is used on content pages to track when they are viewed.

**_Cookies  
_**Persistent client side data ("cookies") are used for some features on the site, particularly the Ultimate Bulletin Board system.  This cookie is a built-in feature of the bulletin board software and is used primarily for the purposes of tracking whether new message board threads have appeared since you last visited.

**_SimHQ.com's Policy on Children  
_**While this site is a general purpose information provider, it is not directed, in whole or part, at children under the age of 13.  Children under the age of 13 years are expressly prohibited from providing any personal information.  We strongly recommend parental supervision of children when using this, or any, Web site.  For more information on children's online privacy generally and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, please see the FTC's [Kidz Privacy site](http://www.simhq.com/cgi-bin/ax.cgi?http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/).   If you are a minor (under the age of 18), you may not take part in any contest run by SimHQ.com.  

_**Sharing of Personal Information  
**_Certain features of the site (such as registration for the message boards) do require the provision of personal information.  The following categories are requested during the board registration process, but only those marked with an asterisk are **required**.

  * User Name* 
  * Password* 
  * Email* 
  * City, State, Country 
  * Occupation 
  * Homepage 
  * Interests 
  * ICQ Number 



We may occasionally request additional information, primarily for contests or giveaways.  If you are a minor (under the age of 18), you may not take part in these contests.  

**_Banner Ads  
_**Our banner ads are monitored by a software package that tracks exposures, hits to the banner, date / time, and the viewer's / clicker's IP address.  All banner ad "customers," whether free (such as affiliates) or paid advertisers, have access to the information for THEIR banner ad(s) ONLY.

**Dissemination of Personal Information by SimHQ.com  
**Any information collected by SimHQ.com, for instance at a survey or in a contest, is for the internal use of SimHQ.com and will not be disclosed to third parties without your prior express consent, except under extraordinary circumstances, such as a court order.  Other examples of exceptions are to notify a contest partner of the winner's names, addresses, etc. OR if a party requests that SimHQ.com provide a feedback form for them on their product for readers to fill out.  

Another exception to this may be aggregate data shared with advertisers (for instance, "90% of our viewers responding to a survey rate our news as "excellent.")
