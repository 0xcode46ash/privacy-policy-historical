**PRIVACY POLICY**

**Privacy Statement for Sikhnet**

Sikhnet has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: Sikhnet. 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your Login Name so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. 

Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address). The customer's contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. 

This site contains links to other sites. **Sikhnet** is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitor's contact information (like their email address) and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders and information about our company to our customers. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. 

Our online surveys ask visitors for demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. 

**Consumer Information**

During the process of delivering an advertisement to you on some web site sections like the Sikh Matrimonials, Sikhnet does not collect any personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address. However, Sikhnet does obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information such as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example). The information collected by Sikhnet is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of our advertisers.

If you would like additional information about the types of non-personally identifiable information that is collected by Sikhnet please let us know[.](http://www.flycast.com/about_us/index.cfm?sub=pri&content=priv-coll)

In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in response to a specific ad (this ad may ask you to fill out a survey or provide your zip code). If this does occur, Sikhnet may collect this information on behalf of an advertiser. This information is used by an advertiser to respond to your request. In addition, Sikhnet may combine this information with other users' information and review it in an aggregate form to understand the type of individuals who view a specific type of ad or visit a particular kind of website.

**Data Collection**

Sikhnet, as well as most sites on the Internet, uses "cookies" to enhance your experience on the web. Sikhnet cannot use these cookies to personally identify you in any way. What are cookies and why do we use them? A cookie is a unique number that is provided to you the first time Sikhnet serves you an ad. This unique number, which is stored in a cookie file on your computer, helps Sikhnet target ads to you. This cookie can help Sikhnet ensure that we don't serve you the same ad multiple times, and help our advertisers understand what you like and don't like about their offerings so that they can cater better to your needs the next time you are interested in their products or services. While we believe that cookies enhance your Internet experience by limiting the number of times you see the same ad and delivering more relevant content to you, they are not required for Sikhnet to deliver you an ad.

If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple procedure to manually delete your cookies. Please consult your web browser's Help documentation for more information.
