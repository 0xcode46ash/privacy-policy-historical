Sierra Wireless respects your privacy. We do not distribute your personal information to any third parties. This includes any information submitted to our registration, mailing list, or ordering forms. When ordering and registering a product or subscribing to our mailing list, we may ask you to provide personal information.

As security remains a primary concern of on-line consumers, Sierra Wireless uses Digital Trust Services and provides a Secure Server ID with digital certificate. 

Our servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an advanced encryption technology that is designed to protect your data and keep unauthorized parties from reading any information you send us. Once we receive your order, we unlock the coded message, send you confirmation of its delivery, and then process the order.
