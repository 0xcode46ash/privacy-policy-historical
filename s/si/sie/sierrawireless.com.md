# Sierra Wireless - Privacy Statement

Sierra Wireless respects your privacy and is committed to protect the personal information that you share with us. Generally, you can browse through our website anonymously without giving us any information about yourself. When we do need your personal information to provide services that you request, this includes any information submitted to our ordering forms, registering a product or subscribing to our mailing lists, Sierra Wireless will use this information to notify you of product upgrades, special offers, and company updates. The information you share with us will be used internally to help us understand your current and future needs. This policy describes how we collect and use your personal information.

If you wish to update or remove your personal information held by us, contact us by email at [privacy@sierrawireless.com](mailto:privacy@sierrawireless.com).

## Information Collection

Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, email address, a home, postal or other physical address, other contact information, title, occupation, industry, personal interests, other information when needed to provide a service you requested. 

When you browse our websites, you do so anonymously, unless you have previously indicated that you wish Sierra Wireless to remember your login and password. We don't automatically collect personal information, including your email address. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our website you visit and how long you spend there. But we do not link your IP address to any personal information unless you have logged in to our website. Like many other commercial websites, the Sierra Wireless website may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the site. Please go to "Cookies, Web Beacons and Tracking" below for more information. 

Sierra Wireless collects personal information when you register with Sierra Wireless for a Sierra Wireless account, when you use certain Sierra Wireless products or services, when you register to attend a seminar or participate in an online survey, when you ask to be included in an email or other mailing list, or you submit an entry for a contest or promotion, or when you submit your personal information to Sierra Wireless for any other reason. From time to time, Sierra Wireless receives personal information from business partners and vendors. Sierra Wireless only uses such information in accordance with this Policy and applicable laws.

Access to certain Sierra Wireless web pages requires a login and a password. The use of those web pages, and the information or programs downloadable from those sites, may be governed by a written agreement between your employer and Sierra Wireless. Unless you request deletion of your personal information as specified below, your personal information may be retained by Sierra Wireless to verify compliance with the agreement, log software licenses granted, to track software downloaded from those pages, or track usage of other applications available on those pages.

## Notice

When personal information is collected, we will inform you at the point of collection the purpose for the collection. Sierra Wireless will not transfer your personal information to third parties without your consent, except under the limited conditions described in the section titled "Information Sharing and Disclosure".

If you choose to provide us with your personal information, we may only transfer that information, within Sierra Wireless or to Sierra Wireless' third party service providers with your permission. Upon receiving your permission, we may transfer your information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. 

## Options

We will always give you the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving direct marketing or market research information. This means we assume you have given us your consent to collect and use your information in accordance with this Policy unless you indicate that you do not consent, for instance by clicking or checking the appropriate option or box at the point of collection. In some cases, when applicable, we will provide you with the opportunity to "opt in." This means we will require your direct consent before we use your information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was submitted.

## Cookies, Web Beacons and Tracking

Sierra Wireless may collect non-identifiable information from visits to our Web sites to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity on Sierra Wireless Web sites, but we do so in ways that keep the information non-identifiable. This information is sometimes known as "click stream data." We use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service. 

A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Some parts of Sierra Wireless's website use cookies to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information to our users and in helping users reach that information. This information is not reviewed at an individual level. If you do not want your transaction details used in this manner you can disable your cookies. 

Sierra Wireless Web sites may also use Web beacon or other technologies to better tailor those sites to provide better customer service. These technologies may be in use on a number of pages across our Web sites. When a visitor accesses these pages, a non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us. These Web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies. 

If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser, although you may not be able to take full advantage of Sierra Wireless's website if you do so. In particular, you may be required to accept cookies in order to complete certain actions on our website. You do not need to have cookies turned on, however, to use/navigate through many parts of our website, except access to certain of Sierra Wireless's web pages may require a login and password. 

## How We Use Information Collected

Sierra Wireless uses information for several general purposes: to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to personalize your experience on our website, to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers or other information we think you'd like to hear about either from us or from our business partners, and to better understand your needs and provide you with better services. We may also use your information to send you, or to have our business partners send you, direct marketing information or contact you for market research.

## Merger and Acquisitions

Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, Sierra Wireless decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or receiving it from sellers. It is Sierra Wireless' practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions. 

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

Because Sierra Wireless is a global company, your personal information may be shared with other Sierra Wireless offices or subsidiaries around the world. All such entities are governed by this Privacy Policy or are bound by the appropriate confidentiality and data transfer agreements. 

Your personal information is never shared outside Sierra Wireless without your permission, except under conditions explained below. Inside Sierra Wireless, data is stored in controlled servers with limited access. Your information may be stored and processed in Canada or any other country where Sierra Wireless, its subsidiaries, affiliates or agents are located. 

Sierra Wireless may send your personal information to other companies or people under any of the following circumstances: when we have your consent to share the information; we need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; we need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Sierra Wireless to provide a product or service to you (we will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose); or we want to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers or other information we think you'd like to hear about either from us or from our business partners (unless you have opted out of these types of communications). We will also disclose your personal information if required to do so by law, to enforce our Terms of Use or in urgent circumstances, to protect personal safety, the public or our websites. 

## Your Ability to Review and Delete Your Account and Information

If you are a registered Sierra Wireless account user, you may request an update or deletion of your personal information held by us by sending an email to: [privacy@sierrawireless.com](mailto:privacy@sierrawireless.com). 

## Data Security

Your Sierra Wireless account information is password-protected for your privacy and security. Sierra Wireless safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. In certain areas of our websites, Sierra Wireless uses industry-standard SSL-encryption (128 bit secure socket layer) firewalls and security systems to enhance the security of data transmissions. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit to us, and so we urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser. 

## Children's Privacy Protection

Our websites do not target and are not intended to attract children under the age of 13. Sierra Wireless does not knowingly solicit personal information from children under the age of 13 or send them requests for personal information. 

## Third Party Sites

Sierra Wireless' website contains links to other sites. Sierra Wireless does not share your personal information with those websites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies. 

Our website may contain links to websites operated by other companies. Some of these third-party sites may be co-branded with a Sierra Wireless logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by Sierra Wireless. Although we choose our business partners carefully, Sierra Wireless is not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our site. Once you have left our website, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party website to determine how they will handle any information they collect from you.
