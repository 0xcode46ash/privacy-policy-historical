# Privacy Policy - Sierra Club

  


**Normal website usage:**  
The Sierra Club has a firm commitment to internet privacy. You can visit most portions of sierraclub.org without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. The only information we collect from a normal web site visit is the name of your internet service provider, the browser and type of machine you are using, the web site that referred you to us, the pages you request and the date and time you request them. We use this information to generate statistics and measure site activity to improve the usefulness of the site to our visitors.

**Collection of personally identifiable information:**  
The Sierra Club may collect email addresses and other personally identifiable data about visitors when such data is voluntarily submitted to sierraclub.org. For example, our site uses order forms for visitors to request information, products, and services, or to become a member. Contact information from the order form is used to send orders and information about the Sierra Club to our visitors. Financial information is used to bill visitors in connection with their orders.

Some of the activist functions of our site also require registration of personal information. We use this information to make these functions more effective and provide participants with additional information about conservation issues. All such information is collected and stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of the data.

The Sierra Club makes every effort to insure the secure collection and transmission of sensitive user information using industry accepted data collection and encryption methodologies.

The Sierra Club does not sell or otherwise disclose such user information outside the organization. However, if you become a member of the Sierra Club, some information on our membership lists, such as your name and address, may be exchanged with other organizations. Members may [opt out](https://web.archive.org/web/20071014080237id_/http%3A//www.sierraclub.org/website/optout.asp) of such membership list exchanges.

**Cookies:**  
Like most websites, the Sierra Club may place a "cookie," or small file, in the browser files of a visitor's computer. We use cookies to save information you give us so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. This allows us to personalize the site to your taste and provide the best web experience possible to our visitors. For more information about cookies, see our [cookie FAQ](https://web.archive.org/web/20071014080237id_/http%3A//www.sierraclub.org/website/cookies.asp).
