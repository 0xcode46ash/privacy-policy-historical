Sierra also owns other domain names that point to the websites listed above. In addition, we may add new sites from time-to-time, which may or may not be listed.

What personal information is collected?

Sierra only collects personal information on a voluntary basis. If an on-line visitor submits information to Sierra, it will usually take the form of either: (1) the purchase of goods or services through our on-line stores, (2) product registration or registration for on-line game participation, (3) player match-up services, (4) message boards, (5) warranty registrations, (6) contest registrations, (7) a consumer complaint, and/or (8) surveys. Personal information collected may include your name, home address, phone number, e-mail address, age, gender, and/or birth date. We do not require this information to gain access to our sites, however, you will not be able to access certain areas that require registration or receive materials such as newsletters unless such information is provided. 

Visitors purchasing products or services through our on-line stores will be required to provide additional information such as a valid credit card number and expiration date. 

What other types of information may we collect?

Your web browser or client software may transmit certain geographic information or information regarding the capabilities or features of your computer to Sierra. Sierra may use this information to generate aggregate statistics about our user community or for security purposes. This information is never linked to you, or your household, in any way. 

How do we use your personal information?

The personal information you provide Sierra will allow us to fulfill your product or service order; alert you of new products or services, features, or enhancements; and/or notify you of upgrade opportunities, contests, or special events and offers. Sierra may enhance or merge the personal information collected at a Sierra site with data collected from third parties. Sierra may also provide your personal information to other companies or organizations that offer products or services that may be of interest to you. In such cases, we will notify you that the information will be shared and provide you an opportunity to opt-out.

Lastly, we may use your personal information for internal marketing, profiling, or demographic purposes, so we can adapt our products and services to better suit your needs. We do this to better understand and serve our customers. 

Who is collecting your information?

When you are asked for information while on a Sierra site, you are sharing that information only with Sierra unless specifically stated otherwise. Some services, however, are provided in conjunction with partner companies. If another company other than Sierra is collecting your personal information, you will be notified at the time the information is collected. If you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that particular service or by not providing any information at that time. 

Please be aware that advertisers or websites with links to our sites may collect personal information about you. Remember, the Sierra Entertainment Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot control the activities of, those other advertisers or websites. 

With whom may my personal information be shared?

Sierra may need to disclose your personal information to third party vendors to fulfill orders, to process mailings, or to analyze and/or store data. In special circumstances, we may also disclose such information if there is a violation of our Terms of Service or Use Agreements or if we have a good faith belief that the law requires it. 

We may also disclose your personal information if we decide to sell a line of business to another company, so that you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible. 

Please be aware that we cannot control the activities of 3rd parties to whom we provide data, and as such we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Sierra. 

Sierra sites also have message boards and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another. When posting to a message board or chat area, please be aware that the information is being made publicly available on-line and the user does so at his or her own risk. 

What choices do I have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of my personal information?

Sierra allows you to control the way that we use personal identifying information that we might obtain. In fact, many of the "mailings" Sierra may send you, such as newsletters, have procedures within them to cancel the receipt of any future mailings. 

If at any time you wish to opt-out of: (1) providing us your personal information, (2) having your personal information shared with third parties, and/or (3) receiving information (via email or postal mail) about new products, services, or promotions, you can do so. E-mail us at [optout@vuinteractive.com](mailto:optout@vuinteractive.com), visit us on the web to select your opt-out options at [Mailing Lists](http://www.sierra.com/interactive/lists/main.html) (http://www.sierra.com/interactive/lists/main.html), or by write to Sierra Entertainment Privacy / Opt-Out at 6080 Center Drive 10th Floor, Los Angeles, California 90045. Please indicate in your request what publications or services you no longer wish to receive so that we may better address your needs. 

What about Children?

__Children Under 13__

Once a child states that their age is under 13, we do not collect or store any personally identifiable information such as name, address, or email address. 

__Note to Parents__ :

We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from young children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without permission, when on-line. No information should be submitted to Sierra On-Line by children 12 and under. Teenagers under the age of 17 and over the age of 12 should encourage their parents to review this policy and to contact us if they would like to evoke our opt-out policy or to raise any concerns. 

What are cookies and how do you use them?

Cookies are a feature of your Web browser that allows Web sites to transfer bits of information to your computer for record-keeping purposes. A cookie stored on your computer can be used to "remember" things like your password, or that you have already registered. This allows us to speed up your future activities, saving the time you would normally spend entering information such as your password or registration. In addition, Sierra may use cookies to retrieve user information for promotional, marketing, or security purposes. 

What are Internet protocol addresses?

An Internet protocol ("IP") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). Sierra may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, or to prevent our servers from being abused.

What do I do if I want to correct or review my personal information?

If for any reason you are concerned with the way we are using your personal information, or would like to correct or request that we cease from using such personal information, please visit us at: [Mailing Lists](http://www.sierra.com/interactive/lists/main.html) (http://www.sierra.com/interactive/lists/main.html) where you can change your information, or contact Sierra Entertainment Privacy On-Line at 6080 Center Drive 10th Floor, Los Angeles, California 90045. You can also contact us by e-mailing us at [privacyonline@sierra.com](mailto:privacyonline@sierra.com). 

How secure is my personal information?

Sierra has taken steps to assure that all information collected will remain secure and in its original form, i.e. free from any alteration. As such, access to all personal information is strictly controlled. When credit card information is transmitted, for example, we use industry standard, SSL (secure lock layer) encryption. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of personal information. 

What if I have a question or complaint?

If you have any questions or wish to file a complaint, please feel free to e-mail us at [privacy@vuinteractive.com](mailto:privacy@vuinteractive.com) or send a letter addressed to Sierra Entertainment Privacy Policy, Attn: Rod Rigole, at 6080 Center Drive, 10th Floor Los Angeles, California 90045.
