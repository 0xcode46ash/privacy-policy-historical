# SIUE Web Privacy Policy

  
It is the policy of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville to respect the privacy of all Web site visitors to the extent permitted by law. SIUE is committed to fully complying with the State Agency Web Site Act (Public Act 093-117) which became effective January 1, 2004. This act restricts the use of "cookies" (small pieces of data stored by a Web browser on a user's computer). Transactional (non-permanent) cookies may be used to facilitate business transactions. Permanent cookies may not be used unless:

  * The use of permanent cookies adds value to the user otherwise not available.
  * The permanent cookies are not used to monitor and track Web site viewing habits, unless all types of information collected and the School's use of same adds user value and are disclosed through a comprehensive Web privacy statement.



The primary University Web server does not use cookies. However, the University Web consists of a number of servers. Some servers hosted by the University may adopt different privacy notices as their specific needs require. If another University Web server has a privacy notice that is different from this notice, then that notice must be approved by the campus Chief Information Officer or equivalent administrator responsible for that domain, and it must be posted on the site that has adopted the different notice. Those sites cannot adopt a privacy notice that in any way supersedes federal or state laws or regulations or University or campus policies.

You should know that when you access the SIUE Web site, the University's web servers automatically gather information regarding browser type, operating system, IP address and the domain name used by the visitor. SIUE may use this information to analyze trends, to create statistics for the purpose of determining technical design specifications and to identify system performance or problem areas.

Personal information that you provide by e-mail or through other online means, such as a response to an inquiry or a request for information, is used only for purposes necessary to serve your requests. This may involve redirecting your inquiry or comment to another person or department better suited to meeting your needs.

Personal information will only be released when it is authorized by law; is permitted under University policies; or is clearly stated in a Web site that information may be shared, and the user indicates consent by providing the information.

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, the University has put into place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. The University strongly encourages University Web administrators to handle the login process through a secure connection, so the user name and password are encrypted between the University Web browser and the University Web server.

Our site may contain links to external Web sites. SIUE is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such Web sites.

If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policies, send an e-mail to the [Interactive Media Manager](mailto:jbenhof@siue.edu) Or write to:

Manager, Interactive Media  
Southern Illinois University Edwardsville  
Campus Box 1016

If you wish to review or change information gathered about you through an official SIUE Web site, you may contact the [Web Administrator](mailto:webadmin@siue.edu) who will assist you in locating the person responsible for that site so that you may make your request for that review or change directly with them.
