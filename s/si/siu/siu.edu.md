Personal information that you provide by e-mail or through other online means, such as a response to an inquiry or a request for information, is used only for purposes necessary to serve your requests. This may involve redirecting your inquiry or comment to another person or department better suited to meeting your needs.

SIU will only release personal information, when legally required, to help law enforcement investigations, legal proceedings, or internal investigations of University rule and regulation violations.
