Such Chief Data Processors have been selected on account of their experience, capabilities and reliability, thorough compliance with the provisions in force applying to processing as also related to security matters. Chief Processors process the Personal Data of Site users following the instructions provided by Triboo Digitale.

In particular, to achieve our Purposes, and as part of the process when purchasing products on the Site,we collect Personal Data (e.g. name and surname, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card and bank details, telephone number) via the product order form available on the Site.

Personal Data are mainly processed in electronic format and in certain cases also in paper format, such as for instance, when the processing of personal data is necessary to prevent fraud on the Site.

Personal Data shall be retained in the form that allows you to be identified for the time strictly necessary for the purpose for which the data were collected and subsequently processed and, in any case within the limits foreseen by the laws in force. To ensure that Personal Data is always accurate and updated, pertinent and complete, you are asked to kindly notify us of any changes to the same sending us an e-mail to: privacy@triboo.it.

Further to what already provided for above, Personal data shall not be disclosed to third parties for purposes not permitted by law or without your express consent.

Personal data is made available to third parties, for ancillary purposes related to the provision of services required by the user (for example, for purchase related transactions). For further details on this aspect, please consult paragraph 4 (Whom we disclose Personal Data to). You can at any time obtain an updated list of Chief Data Processors by sending a request to the following e-mail address: privacy@triboo.it.

Your personal data can be disclosed to Police forces or Judicial authorities, for instance pursuant to Site anti-fraud services, in accordance with the laws in force and whenever requested. Your Personal Data will also be accessible to Chief Data Processors as indicated in paragraph 2 and for the specific purposes listed therein. Personal data will not be transferred abroad to Countries other than those belonging to the European Union, which do not guarantee a sufficient level of privacy protection. If the above should be necessary to achieve our Purposes, we will ensure that the transfer of Personal Data to Countries which do not belong to the European Union and do not guarantee adequate levels of protection,  will only be implemented after such parties and Triboo Digitale have all signed specific contracts containing clauses for the protection of Personal Data, in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

The purposes for which your Personal Data are processed shall be specifically disclosed each time in the Information Note text provided on the page where the same are requested to confer their Personal Data.

There may be cases where Triboo Digitale processes third-party personal data communicated directly by Triboo Digitale users, e.g. when the user intends to tell a friend about a service or product on sale at the Site, or when the user purchases a product to be sent to a friend or when the subject paying for the purchase is different to the subject to whom it will be delivered.

In such cases, you are required to be sure to obtain the consent of the person in question before conferring their data to Triboo Digitale, and to inform about this Privacy Policy because you will, in fact, be the only person responsible for the conferral of third party information and data without specific request or consent of the same, further to any misuse or illegal use of the same. In any case, Triboo Digitale, to the extent required by law, shall fulfil its disclosure obligations to the indicated user and, where necessary, request relative consent, upon registration of the relevant data in its Personal Data archives.

Conferral of Personal Data to Triboo Digitale and, in particular, personal data, your email address, your mailing address, your credit card / debit card and bank details and phone number, is required in order to fulfil our Purposes.

Some of the aforementioned data may be indispensable so as to fulfil the obligations imposed by the law or other regulations, or to provide other services you may have requested as provided on the Site.

Refusal to disclose certain essential Personal Data, identified on the Site by an asterisk (*),  may make it impossible to complete all  purchase contract phases, and/or fulfil all  obligations required by the laws and regulations in force. Failure to disclose certain Data can therefore, according to individual circumstances, constitute a legitimate and justified reason preventing the execution of the purchase contract on the Site or the supply of services via the same.
