website at http://www.sisense.com (the “Site”) and is committed to protect the
information it collects and/or is disclosed to it by the users of this Site and of services

SiSense collects information from our users at several different points on our Site. This

experience on the Site.

however require registration. Also, upon downloading or using our software products
may require registration as well. Personal information, such as a user's name, address,
contact information and other personally-identifiable information ("Personal

you register to the Site, request support enter into a sales promotion or otherwise
interact with us (for example through the "contact us" option). It should be made clear
that you have no legal obligation to provide us with any Personal Information and the
submission of such information is entirely subject to your sole discretion and consent.
However if you will not provide us with the required information we may not be able to
provide you with the information/services requested by you. Registered users may have
a user name and password to access their information.
We may also collect statistical and other data related to your use of the Site, our
software products or services as well as information on Site usage patterns. This
information is collected and used as non-individually identifiable information.

SiSense to process, store, retrieve and monitor data within any computer network on
which the Software has been installed, including personal data of our customers and
those users of the customer which are authorized to use the Software, and transmit
such data internally within SiSense as necessary to ensure data protection, provide
services to SiSense' customers and/or to verify compliance with the terms of the license
agreement.

usage shall be done solely to the extent necessary for SiSense in performing its
obligations under the applicable license agreement.
HOW WE USE INFORMATION
We use information which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to
administer the Site and improve our services, to track users’ movements around the
Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may
use such information collected in combination with Personal Information to market
directly to a certain person subject to requirements of applicable law. This non personal
information may be shared with third parties.
We compile and store data and information and generate reports related to our users'
access to and use of our Site and services.

personal information that we collect will be stored in our database and will be used in
accordance with such applicable laws and regulations.
We do not share, distribute, sell or rent any of your Personal Information with/to third
parties, except in the following circumstances:
•            If the information is required by law in order to prevent, investigate, or take
action regarding illegal activities. In addition, we will share information in response to
legal process, court orders, subpoenas, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or
defend against legal claims;
•            For the purpose of providing and operating the Site we may share non-PII
information with trusted third-party partners who need to know for purpose of
providing Site-related services to us only (and not for such third parties' commercial use
in any way). We will require that these third parties comply with this Privacy Policy or
with privacy policies at least as protective as this Privacy Policy.
•            If we have your permission to do so.
Any data processing performed by these third parties will, if and when required by law,
be governed by a data processing agreement in the form required by law, preserving
your statutory data protection rights.

submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, due to the
nature of Internet communications and evolving technologies, unauthorized entry or
use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, the security of user information
may be compromised at any time. No method of transmission over the Internet, or
method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.

disclaim any assurance that such information will remain free from loss, misuse, or
alteration by third parties who, despite our efforts, obtain unauthorized access.

their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those
companies.

endeavour to remove your personal data provided to us). Where appropriate, you may

have access to, and may edit, your profile.
