Privacy Policy

SitePoint respects your privacy. Below is an outline of what information this network gathers, how it’s used, and how you can "opt-out":

  * Whenever your request a page, your IP address, browser and version, operating system and the site you came from are stored in a log file. This information cannot be used to identify a specific individual. This information is only used for statistical purposes to help improve this site and provide accurate statistics to advertisers in the form of aggregated data. This information is kept on a secure dedicated server hosted by RackSpace. 
  
 
  * The email addresses collected from the sign-ups for our newsletter are not sold, or disclosed to a third party. The email addresses collected will only be used to send out the newsletter/e-zine. You will not receive any mailings you did not request. The email addresses are stored on a server hosted by Dundee.net. You can remove yourself from our list at any time by sending a blank email to: unsubscribe@sitepoint.com from the address that you subscribed under.
  
 
  * The email addresses collected for the Opt-in lists (AKA "Information Announcement Lists") are used by Postmaster Direct to send announcements to individuals who requested them. You will not receive any mailings you did not request, and you can remove yourself at any time. Your email address will not be disclosed to any 3rd party besides Postmaster Direct. Instructions for removal from these mailings are included in each individual email message that is sent to you.
  
 
  * When a contest/sweepstakes is run on this site you may be asked to supply some personally identifying information like your name, email address and phone number. This information will only be used to notify winners of the contest/sweepstakes. Non-identifying information may be analyzed, aggregated and presented to third-parties to provide an overview of the demographics of our networks visitors.
  
 
  * When a survey appears on the SitePoint network information is collected, compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. SitePoint may share this aggregated data with advertisers or business partners. 
  
 
  * Cookies on this site are used by our ad management system, and occasionally by advertisers who use 3rd party ad serving solutions. Cookies are only used to prevent the displaying of the same ad to the individual more then once, for proper directing of clickthroughs and statistical tracking. Cookies cannot be used to identify specific individuals.
  
 
  * Across the SitePoint network there are several polls. By voting you are not disclosing any other information other then the answer to the question the poll asks. A vote cannot be traced to a specific individual, and hence your identity remains anonymous. This information may be used to provide advertisers with demographic information.
  
 
  * The information collected during the registration process for the SitePoint Community is used to contact members in the event of a Forum rule violation. It can also be used to prevent banned users from re-registering under a different username. The email address will only be seen by moderators and adminstrators if the "Keep your email address viewable to other users when you post notes?" option is set to no.
  * The IP address is logged whenever a post in the SitePoint Community Forums. This information is used if it becomes necessary to ban a user. The IP address can only be seen by administrators and moderators.
