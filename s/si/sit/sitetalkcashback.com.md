# Welcome to Sitetalk Cashback and get rewarded for your online activities.

**What data we collect and why**

Our vision is to maximize the rewards for all of Sitetalk cashback (hereinafter called STCB) members and to provide as many member benefits as possible. The key way in which STCB provides value is to share with members the commissions we receive from our affiliated stores. The information we collect (name, email address, and PayPal or Bank Account) is used to track and send the cashback payments members earn.

Additionally, we may use information on the stores you visit or the offers you view on www.sitetalkcashback.com to select special offers that will be relevant to you. Except at an aggregate level, however, we do not share that information with our store partners or other third parties.

Finally, STCB collects data on the devices that access or attempt to access our websites. This device data is used in conjunction with a third party security partner to identify and prevent fraudulent activity and does not include personally identifiable information. 

 **Who sees your personal information?**

Only a very limited number of STCB employees ever have access to your personal information. This information is used to track and send the cashback payments you earn.

We may use contractors or vendors to help us provide some of the services at our site. If we need to disclose personal information for them to provide the services, it is with the requirement that the information is kept confidential and is used only for those services.

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website or to protect STCB and its members from losses.

 **How we keep your information secure**

The security of your personal information is important to STCB.  www.sitetalkcashback.com uses a secure, encrypted connection (called an SSL connection) on all pages where you access or transmit personal information with an Extended Validation service certificate to ensure its users on the authentication of our website. 

 **Your privacy with SiteTalk Cash Back**

STCB will never ask for your username, password or any other personal information in an unsolicited phone call, email or letter. Further, any contact with STCB customer service in which personal information is exchanged with a customer service representative will be used only for the purpose of satisfying your request. Any personal information you provide will not be recorded or used for any reason beyond that of the stated request.

If we change our privacy policy, we will post a change notice to this privacy statement and other appropriate places. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it regularly. If we make changes to this policy, we will notify you, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page. 

 **Your privacy with our stores and advertisers**

STCB does not record personal information passed from our members to affiliated stores. Order information, including order numbers and amounts, may be available to STCB, the store, or third party affiliate program management companies for accurate tracking purposes, but his information will not be released by STCB to other parties.

STCB contains links to various other sites. Each of these sites has a privacy policy that may differ from that of STCB. If you wish to receive special offers directly from a store, neither this privacy policy nor our opt-out policy applies to those communications. Instead, please refer to the relevant store's privacy and opt-out policy.

 **Our policies on email**

STCB sends two types of email to members: customer service emails required maintaining the STCB program (like cash back credits & payment notifications); and promotional emails featuring especially good offers. You may choose not to receive promotional emails at any time from STCB or by clicking the "unsubscribe" link in an email.

STCB does not support spamming by our members and we explicitly prohibit it in our Terms & Conditions. If you would like to report an incident of spamming using our referrer-a-friend capability, please contact us. We will investigate and take suitable action.

 **Cookies and how are they used**

Cookies are small text files that a web site can write to your computer. We may use cookies to identify you and allow you to log in once to STCB and shop without having to log in again. Cookies are also used by many of our merchants to identify you as a STCB member.

STCB requires its members to have cookies enabled in order to accumulate cashback rewards. 

 **Your choices and responsibilities**

Periodically we may send you emails on new features or special offers. On every one of these emails you will be given the choice to unsubscribe from STCB promotional mailings. Simply follow the directions in any of our emails.

It is the member's responsibility to update and maintain accurate contact information in their account. You can make changes by visiting your account page and entering corrections. Email and payment account information that are entered into a member's personal profile page are the information that will be used for all communication including for sending you cash back payments. STCB is not responsible for payments sent to an incorrect bank or PayPal account.

We will post all changes to this Privacy Agreement here at our site. You are responsible for checking periodically on policy updates.

 **Third-party verification**

STCB is a licensee of Thatwe Secure Site with Extended Validation and includes an SSL certificate, daily website malware scanning and vulnerability assessment to secure www.sitetalkcashback.com and help defend against attacks. The green address bar, Norton Secured Seal and Seal-in-Search technology assure all STCB members that our site is safe to browse and use.
