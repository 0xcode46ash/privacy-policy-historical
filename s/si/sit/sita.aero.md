# Privacy statement | SITA

SITA and its affiliated companies ("SITA") value our relationship with our business partners and any party which may be interested in SITA's business for any reason and we are committed to protecting their privacy.  This Statement outlines the types of personal information collected on our Website, how this data is used and safeguarded as well as how users may exercise their rights with respect to personal information.

## Information collection & use

The types of personal information that may be collected via our Website may be provided by the user voluntarily or collected automatically on our Website (e.g. by using cookies or other online technologies).

### Registration

In order to use certain areas of this Website, you must first complete the registration form and create a user name and password.  During registration, you are required to give contact information such as your name and email address. We use this information to contact you about the services on our Website in which you have expressed interest.

You have the option to provide additional information to us. We encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you with a more personalized experience on our Website.

SITA is the sole owner of the information collected on this Website (SITA.aero or other SITA owned websites). SITA collects personal information from our users at several different points on our Website.

At any given moment you can use the Unsubscribe functionality in case you do not wish to be registered anymore (<http://comms.sita.aero/Preference-Center.html>).

#### Provision of information

Any personal information provided by you to SITA through this Website will be used for the purpose of providing you with SITA information. Such information will be sent to you using the contacts information you have submitted via this Website.

#### Surveys or contests

From time to time, we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our Website.  If you participate, we will request certain personal information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically includes contact information and demographic information.

We use this information to monitor site traffic and further understand our market and your requirements.

#### 'Email a colleague’

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a colleague about our Website, we will ask you for your colleague’s name and email address.  We may send your colleague email inviting him or her to visit the Website.  SITA stores this information for the sole purpose of sending email. At any given moment your colleague can use the Unsubscribe functionality in case he / she does not wish to be registered anymore (<http://comms.sita.aero/Preference-Center.html>).

You or your colleague may also contact us at [privacy@sita.aero](mailto:privacy@sita.aero) to request that we remove this information from our database.

#### Product offers and updates

If you have registered to our Website, we will occasionally send you information on SITA’s products and services. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may unsubscribe by following the instructions in the section “Choice and Opt-out” below.

#### Newsletters

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use contact information, e.g. your name and email address to send the newsletter to you.  If you no longer wish to receive our newsletters, you may unsubscribe by following the instructions in the section “Choice and Opt-out” below.

#### Service-related announcements

We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.  For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.

Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.  If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.

#### Customer service

Based upon the personal information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email.  We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone.

#### User/registration profile

We may store information that we collect through log files to create a (registration) “profile” of your preferences.  We tie your personal information, and e.g. your purchasing and engagement (which pages visited) history, to information in the (registration) profile in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to improve the content of the Website for you.

In case, we would share your profile with third parties contracted to, and under instruction by SITA, we would provide prior information on that to you.

To update, change or delete your profile, please check [https://www.sita.aero/edit-profile](https://web.archive.org/customer-area/edit-profile) or email us at: [privacy@sita.aero](mailto:privacy@sita.aero).

#### Cookies

SITA may use Cookies on (some of) its website(s). Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser. When this information is stored on your hard drive, our system is able to recognize your browser and automatically log you in where appropriate. Cookies are used by SITA so that we can make it easier for you to access our Website. Cookies only contain your login information. If you do not want us to install a cookie on your device, simply do not agree when prompted to accept the installation of cookies, do not tick the "Remember me" option or log out. For more information on the use of cookies, you can view our complete [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/globalassets/docs/other/cookies-privacy/sita-cookie-policy.pdf "SITA Cookie Policy").

#### Log files

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and navigation data.

We use this information to analyze trends, to administer our Website, to track users’ movements around the Website and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

## Information sharing and disclosure

Except as provided in this Privacy Statement, we will not share, sell, license, trade or rent users’ personal information to or with any third party without the user's consent.

We will share user information in the following ways:

  * **Third party service providers, agents and distributors** ("Service Providers"): We may share user information with our services providers who process user personal information to provide services to us or on our behalf (e.g., to assist us with the functioning of our Website).  We have contracts with our service providers that prohibit them from sharing the information about our users that they collect or that we provide to them with anyone else, or using it for other purposes.
  * **Group entities** : We may share user information with other subsidiaries, affiliate companies or Agents of the SITA group of entities for the purposes explained above.  
  * **Fraud prevention** : We may disclose the personal information we collect about our users when we believe disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or respond to suspected illegal or fraudulent activity or to protect the safety, rights, or property of us, our users, or others.
  * **Law enforcement purposes** : If requested or required by government authorities, such as law enforcement authorities, courts, or regulators, or otherwise to comply with the law, we may disclose any information we have about our users. We also may disclose information collected about a user in order to exercise or protect legal rights or defend against legal claims.
  * **Sale or merger of our business** : We may transfer user personal information to a third party if we or any of our affiliates are involved in a corporate restructuring (e.g., a sale, merger, or other transfer of assets). 
  * **Advertisers and advertising networks** : We may share user information with advertisers and advertising networks who place ads (including sponsored links in search results) on our website.



#### Data transfers

We may transfer your personal information to our subsidiaries, affiliate companies or agents, and also to third parties, which may be located outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"), including for processing an order and providing you with support services. By providing your personal information to us, you understand that it may be transferred, stored or processed outside the EEA.  In such case, SITA will ensure all the recipients of your information located outside the EEA have entered into a contractual arrangement with SITA (e.g., by signing the EU's Standard Contractual Clauses) which protects your personal information whenever it is transferred outside the EEA. For more information, please also see our [Third Party Data Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/globalassets/docs/other/cookies-privacy/third-party-data-privacy-policy.pdf "Third Party Data Privacy Policy"). 

#### Choice/opt-out

We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personal information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information.

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter, promotional or other (electronic) communications, you may opt-out of / unsubscribe to receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or via: <http://comms.sita.aero/Preference-Center.html>. For all other requests, such as (full) personal data erasure, please email us at [privacy@sita.aero](mailto:privacy@sita.aero).

#### Information security

We take the security of our users' personal information seriously and use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect their personal information against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.  However, because no security system can be 100% effective, we cannot completely guarantee the security of any information we may have collected from or about our users.

#### Retention of personal information

We retain the information we collect about and from users for as long as necessary to fulfill a business purpose or comply with a legal request.  We may also choose to anonymize certain of the information provided to us so that it can no longer be attributed to a user if we would like to retain it for longer periods of time.

#### Links to other sites

This Website contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by SITA. Please be aware that we, SITA, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.

We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Website and to read the privacy statements of each and every Website that collects personal information.

This Privacy Statement applies only to information collected by this Website.

#### Access to personal information

You may access, update and rectify your personal information on your profile directly. You may further request that your personal information be erased or restricted. If you do so, we will delete your account and you will no longer have access to all the services on our Website.

At any given moment you can use the Unsubscribe functionality, if applicable, in case you do not wish to be registered anymore (<http://comms.sita.aero/Preference-Center.html> ).
