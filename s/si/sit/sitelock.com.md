PRIVACY POLICY

to make your experience using our services on the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible,
and we want you to use the Internet's vast array of information, tools, and opportunities with complete
confidence.
We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This
privacy policy applies to http://www.sitelock.com owned and operated by SiteLock, LLC. This Privacy
Policy describes how the Company collects information from all end users of the Company’s services
(the “Services”) — those who access some of our Services but do not have accounts (“Visitors”) as
well as those who pay a service fee to subscribe to the Service (“Customers”) — what we do with the
information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Customers have concerning the collection and
use of such information. The Company requests that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.
SiteLock, LLC has been awarded TRUSTe’s Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and
practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with TRUSTe's program requirements
including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal
information. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site,
http://www.sitelock.com. The TRUSTe program does not cover information collected through the
network of Web sites accessible through our Services.
TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and
organizations globally through its leading privacy Trustmark and innovative trust solutions. If you have
questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at

SiteLock, LLC complies with the U.S. – E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S. - Swiss Safe
Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use,
and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland. SiteLock,

1. Introduction. The Company collects information in different ways from Visitors and Customers
who access the various parts of our Web site, Services and the network of Web sites accessible
through our Services. We use this information primarily to provide a customized experience as you
use our Services and, generally, do not share this information with third parties. However, we may
disclose personal information collected if we have received your permission beforehand or in very
special circumstances, such as when we believe that such disclosure is required by law or other
special cases described below.
2. Registration. Customers are asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for
our Services including name, address, telephone number, billing information (such as a credit card
number), and the type of personal computer being used to access the Services. Visitors inquiring
about the Services may be asked to submit business information, such as company name and phone
number. The personal information collected from Customers during the registration process is used to
manage each Customer's account (such as for billing purposes). This information is not shared with


third parties. The Company may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal
information Customers provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of
Customers). As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying
information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services.
3. The Company’s Partners and Sponsors. Some of the Company products and services are
offered to Visitors and Customers in conjunction with a non-affiliated partner. To provide Visitors and
Customers some of these products and services, the partner may need to collect and maintain
personal information. In these instances, we will provide such data collected or transferred to our
Partners and Sponsors (e.g., domain registration). Additionally, many of the Company Customers
have co-branded pages that are co-sponsored by non-affiliated partners. The Company will share
non-identifying and aggregate information (except as described above), but not personal information,
with such partners in order to administer the co-branded products or services offered. We may
provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business
activities such as providing additional security or compliance services. These companies are
authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
4. Responses to Email Inquiries. When Visitors or Customers send email inquiries to the Company,
the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive. The Company does not use
the return email address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with any
third party.
5. Voluntary Customer Surveys. We may periodically conduct both business and individual
customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide
us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we
provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if
the survey is conducted by a third party; that company is prohibited from using our users’ personal
information for any other purpose. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary. We will not
share the personal information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless
we give you prior notice and choice. We take the information we receive from individuals responding
to our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other Company
customers to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age,
residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We
then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new
services and products. This aggregated, non-personal information may be shared with third parties.
6. Special Cases. It is the Company’s policy not to use or share the personal information about
Visitors or Customers in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an
opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. However, the Company may disclose
personal information about Visitors or Customers, or information regarding your use of the Services
or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that
it is reasonable to do so, including: to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy
Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is
necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our
Acceptable Use Policy or other user policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect the
Company and our Customers. If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a
portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any
change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have
regarding your personal information.
7. “Cookies” and How the Company Uses Them. A “cookie” is a small data file that can be placed
on your hard drive when you visit certain Web sites. The Company may use cookies to collect, store,


and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the products and services we
provide and to manage our telecommunications networks. If you are a Customer and have created
your own Personal Start Page, we will use a cookie to save your settings and to provide customizable
and personalized services. These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your customer
information. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet
browser’s “help” directory. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use
some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.
Additionally, be aware that if you visit non-Company Web sites where you are prompted to log in or
that are customizable, you may be required to accept cookies. Advertisers and partners may also use
their own cookies. We do not control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for
information collected through them.
8. Statistics. As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in
log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service
provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We
use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site,
to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user
base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable
information.
9. The Company's Commitment to Data Security. The security of your personal information is
important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order
forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both
during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method
of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute
security. Services and Web sites we sponsor have security measures in place to protect the loss,
misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. If you have any questions about security
on our Web site, you can contact us at support@sitelock.com
10. How to Access, Delete or Modify Your Information. If your personal information changes, or if
you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, or amend it by making the change on your
account settings page, request deletion by emailing our Customer Support at support@sitelock.com
or by contacting us by telephone at the contact information listed below. We will respond to your

email address. If a user of the Services desires to have their information modified or deleted, they
should contact the administrator they deal with directly.
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you
services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations,
resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

policy of any Web site you visit.
13. Revisions to This Policy. We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our
information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail
address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming
effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy
