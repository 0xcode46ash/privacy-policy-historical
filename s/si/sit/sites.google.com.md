February 8, 2008

The [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html) describes how we treat personal information when you use Google's services, including information provided to Google Sites. In addition, the following describes our practices that are specific to Google Sites.

**Personal Information**

  * _Account activity_. You need a Google Account to use Google Sites. Google asks for some personal information when you create a Google Account, including your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access. Google's servers automatically record certain information about your use of Google Sites. Similar to other web services, Google records information such as account activity (e.g., storage usage, number of log-ins, actions taken), data displayed or clicked on (e.g., UI elements, links), and other [log information](http://www.google.com/privacy_faq.html#serverlogs) (e.g., browser type, IP address, date and time of access, cookie ID, referrer URL).
  * _Content_. Google Sites stores, processes and maintains your content in order to provide the service to you.



**Uses**

  * We use this information internally to deliver the best possible service to you, such as improving the Google Sites user interface and maintaining a consistent and reliable user experience.
  * Content you create with Google Sites may, if you choose, be read, copied, used and redistributed by people you know or, again if you choose, by people you do not know. Use care when including sensitive personal information in content you share, such as social security numbers, financial account information, home addresses or phone numbers.



**Your choices**

  * You may terminate your use of Google Sites at any time.
  * You may permanently delete any content you create in Google Sites. Because of the way we maintain this service, residual copies of your files and other information associated with your account may remain on our servers for three weeks.



**More information**

Google adheres to the U.S. Safe Harbor privacy principles. For more information about the Safe Harbor framework or our registration, see the [Department of Commerce's web site](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/).
