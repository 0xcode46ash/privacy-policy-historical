# Privacy Policy | SiteImprove

Your privacy on the internet is very important to us. The success of our business depends upon our ability to maintain the trust of our clients. As part of the operation of SiteImprove.com we gather certain types of information about SiteImprove.com users, and we would like to explain the types of information we gather, what we do with it and how you can correct or change the information.

Cookies allow SiteImprove.com to measure activity on the website and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences, thus allowing you to visit various member-only parts of the website without re-registering. Cookies are also used by SiteImprove.com to measure activity on the website and make improvements and updates based on which areas are popular and which are not.

  * To customise the content and/or the layout of the website for each individual user 
  * To notify users about updates to the website 
  * To send out newsletters or information about other opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you.
