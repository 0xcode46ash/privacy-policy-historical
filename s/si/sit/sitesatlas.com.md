World Sites Atlas is deeply committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users. Below we outline our continued support for the responsible management of consumer information.

When you consult a page on World Sites Atlas, we do not collect any personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address. However, World Sites Atlas does obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information such as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example). This information is collected to assist us in our site marketing and maintenance.

While World Sites Atlas does not use "cookies", two of our partners do: TravelNow, which specializes in on-line hotel reservations, car rental, and other travel services, and Burst Media, which provides advertising banners, use cookies to enhance your experience on the web. These cookies cannot be used to personally identify you in any way. If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple procedure to block and manually delete them. Please consult your web browser's Help documentation for more information.

World Sites Atlas stores basic data on Premium members, including name and e-mail address.
