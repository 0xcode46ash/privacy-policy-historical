# SiteGround Web Hosting - Privacy Policy

Privacy of Your Registration Data

When you order from Site Ground, all your personal information is protected. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the industry standard, for encrypting all personal information, including name, address and etc. Site Ground keeps all your information confidential.

Your registration information is used to operate the site, for demographic statistics, for supporting your account, etc. Site Ground will not send you any unsolicited information, though you will receive a New Customers welcome letter explaining the features provided by our service; and you may also receive periodic member letters announcing important service changes, new features, technical issue updates and news about the Service.

Shall We Disclose Information to Third Parties?

We shall not intentionally monitor or disclose any of your e-mail messages, registration data or account data and activity unless this is required by law, or we believe in good faith that we are required to do so to protect the rights and the property of Site Ground or its customers;

Since privacy is a function of your password, we encourage you to change your password frequently and not to share it with anyone. Site Ground cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this.

What Are Cookies?

Site Ground understands that many of you are concerned about cookies. These are small pieces of data that are sent to your browser from a web server and are stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not damage your system in any way. Cookies are used to identify what visitors look for on a web-site so that it can be more easily accessible in the future. We use cookies primarily to assure that our referral program is operating in a correct and fair way. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent.

IP Address Information

All computers connected to the Internet have an IP address. When a visitor requests a page from any Web site within the Site Ground Network, our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor's IP address. The IP address reveals nothing personal about you. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, but do not collect and evaluate this information for individuals. 

Spamming Policy

Site Ground does not tolerate any spamming activity. This includes, but is not limited to unsolicited broadcast or commercial bulk emails sent to addresses which do not affirmatively and verifiably request such material from that specific sender. Our aim is to protect our customers and all internet users from the negative effects of the "spam"-related activity. A record, clearly affirming that permission has been obtained from a recipient before a mailing is sent, may be required. Disregarding Site Ground spamming policy will result in warning, suspension or possible account termination with no refund. Site Ground may but is not obliged to forward to its customers valid complaints against them for their response and resolution. We require a 24-hour response for any complaint forwarded. If a response is not received Site Ground may block traffic to and from the domain involved in the problem. 

While Site Ground will provide its clients with reasonable notification, Site Ground reserves the right to change its policy at any time to meet the needs of our customers, changing laws and new technology.
