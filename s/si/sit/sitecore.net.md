# Sitecore Privacy Policy

**_Summary:_**

Here is the short version of our Privacy Policy for those who don’t have the time to read the whole thing:

  * We will not sell your personal information that you give to us, including your email, and will only use it for internal purposes. 
  * We place various cookies on your browser to understand how you’re using the Sitecore Website and how we can then provide you with experiences and offers that align with your needs. Some of the cookies are for third parties that help us advertise and measure the impact of our advertising, which allows us to spend our marketing money thoughtfully. If you don’t like cookies, then please do not browse the Sitecore Website.



**_The Whole Thing:_**

This privacy policy sets out how Sitecore Corporation A/S, a Danish limited liability company with company registration no. (CVR) 26032512 (“Sitecore”), and its affiliated entities, use and protect the information that you provide on, or that is otherwise collected through, the Sitecore Website. This policy is based on our fundamental goal to provide our visitors with quality information and resources while maintaining individual anonymity and personal privacy. Sitecore may change this policy periodically by posting the modified policy on the Sitecore Website. You should check this page from time to time to ensure that you continue to agree with the terms of this policy. Your use of the Sitecore Website means that you accept this privacy policy.

**The Sitecore Websites**  
“Sitecore Website” as used in this policy means SITECORE.NET, including all subdomains thereunder. The Sitecore Website is owned, provided by and controlled by Sitecore and its affiliated entities.

**The Information We Collect**  
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Sitecore Website. When you access the Sitecore Website, some information is automatically collected as specified below. No other information is collected through the Sitecore Website unless you deliberately decide to send it to us (e.g., by clicking on a link to send us an e-mail), which is also specified below. 

“Automatically Collected Access Information” means the following categories and specific information thereunder:

  * “Client Information”: the Internet domain, registered company (if applicable), GeoIP information, and Internet address of the computer you are using. 
  * “Essential Technical Information”: identification of the page or service you are requesting, type of browser and operating system you are using; and the date and time of access. 
  * “Nonessential Technical Information”: the Internet address of the web site from which you linked directly to our web site, and the "Cookie Information" described below.



“Optional Information” includes the following information:

  * When you send us an e-mail: your name, e-mail address, and the content of your e-mail.
  * When responding to online forms or polls or other questions or comment in a blog: any information entered into these forms, polls, questions or blog comment fields.
  * When you register an account on the Sitecore Website: your name, e-mail address, and any additional information you provide as part of your registration.
  * When you provide credentials to access or authenticate your account via Facebook.com, Linked-in.com, or other third party services: information provided by such third parties.



**The Way We Use Information**  
Client Information is used to route the requested web page to your computer for viewing; in theory, the requested web page and the routing information could be discerned by other entities involved in transmitting the requested page to you - we do not control the privacy practices of those entities. We may keep Client Information obtained from our systems indefinitely after the web page is transmitted. 

Essential Technical Information and Nonessential Technical Information help us respond to your request in an appropriate format (or in a personalized manner) and helps us plan website improvements. Additionally, on rare occasions when a "hacker" attempts to breach computer security, logs of Automatically Collected Access Information are collected to permit a security investigation and in such cases may be forwarded together with any other relevant information in our possession to law enforcement agencies.

Optional Information enables us to provide services or information tailored more specifically to your needs, and also allows us to plan website improvements. We may use incomplete Optional Information you have provided to contact you for the purpose of offering additional assistance. 

**Use of Personally Identifiable Information**  
We take your privacy very seriously. Any information constituting personally identifiable information, whether about yourself or someone else (hereinafter “Personally Identifiable Information”), is only used to complete your specific request, and we do not share or otherwise distribute Personally Identifiable Information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that request, or in response to a validly-issued subpoena, court order, or other legal process, or when necessary to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims made by you or on your behalf. In such instances we would seek confidential treatment of any of your Personally Identifiable Information so disclosed, but there is no guarantee that confidential treatment can be obtained.

Finally, we agree that we will never use or share Personally Identifiable Information provided to us by you in any way that violates or is otherwise unrelated to the means described in this policy, without providing you with both a clear notice on the Sitecore Website and an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

So that we may best serve you, you are responsible for ensuring that all Personally Identifiable Information you provide on the Sitecore Website is maintained and kept current.

As part of the registration, you are required to provide certain Personally Identifiable Information as set forth under “Optional Information” above. Further, you acknowledge that when you provide credentials to access or authenticate your account via Facebook.com, Linked-in.com, or other third party services, Sitecore is not responsible for the security of your password, credentials, or other Personally Identifiable Information stored or provided by such services.
