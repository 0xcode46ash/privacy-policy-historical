# Terms of Service – Sight Reading Factory®

Sight Reading Factory (the “Service,” or “SRF”) is a product of GraceNotes, LLC (“GraceNotes,” “we,” or “us”), a Virginia limited liability company. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) governs the use of all user accounts, as well as all activity on, in, or related to the Service, the SRF web site, and interactions with us. 

We collect: the names and e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, information volunteered by the user (such as site registrations), and non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor action and request. The information we collect is used to improve the content and the quality of our service, and is not shared with or sold to other organizations except to provide products or services, when we have your permission, or when it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Terms of Service or this policy, or as otherwise required by law. 

## Information gathering and usage

When you register for any GraceNotes service, we ask for information such as your name, email address, school/organization name, school/organization address, credit card information, and Paypal account details. We do not store credit card information, as those transactions are handled by a trusted third party vendor, which at the time of the writing of this policy is Stripe. GraceNotes uses collected information for the following purposes: products and services provision, billing, identification and authentication, service improvement, contact, and general research. 

## Cookies

Cookies are small text files containing a user's settings and other data used by websites, and they are stored on the user's computer. They are transmitted as parcels of text sent by a server to a Web client (usually a browser) and then sent back unchanged by client each time it accesses that server. Cookies are required for the functioning of the Service. We use cookies to record session information as our users use the application, but we never use permanent cookies. 

## Data Storage

GraceNotes uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware and other technical contributions required to run SRF. Although we own the code, databases, and all rights to SRF and the Service, you retain all rights to your own data. 

## Disclosure

GraceNotes reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information under certain circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas, or when actions of any user are believed or alleged to violate the Terms of Service. As deemed necessary, in our judgment, we will share information in order to investigate illegal activities at any stage and in any capacity, such as suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise dictated by law. 

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, GraceNotes may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and at GraceNotes’ sole discretion. GraceNotes encourages visitors to check this page frequently for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Service after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
