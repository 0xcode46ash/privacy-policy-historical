A "Cookie" is a small piece of information sent by our web server to your web browser, which enables us to record anonymous details and allows you to move around the Site faster. We may use cookies for a number of purposes, for instance to enable us to simplify the logging on process, to help ensure the security and authenticity of members and to enable traffic monitoring.
