# Privacy Policy

Let’s face it. You came to this page because you are concerned about your privacy. You don’t know us and honestly… you just don’t trust us. Am I right? That’s perfectly understandable. There are a lot of fraudulent sites on the internet.

We started this company to help churches, temples, schools, soccer moms, coaches, room parents, and people just like us organize their lives. We want to be a company with integrity that will simplify life for our users, not take advantage them. So if any of the items below are unclear or you want to discuss them with us, please contact us.

Our Policy:

**We do not knowingly add users to our website without permission.** A person can be added to our site when they sign up themselves or a friend invites them to a sign up form. If a friend adds your information to our site and you do not want to be a part of our service, just [contact us](https://web.archive.org/help) and our staff will delete you from our system.

**We do not sell or distribute your contact information or emails to third party vendors, period.** We hate spam and figure you do too. We use your email as part of our application, of course, but we take special care with it and never display it publicly on our site.

**We promise not to bother you with unwanted emails and we allow you to control what emails you receive.** You will, of course, receive emails as part of the SignUpGenius service including invites to sign up forms, status updates, and reminder notifications. In addition, we have an email newsletter that is sent out periodically to members that have created sign ups in order to inform them of new features. Users can unsubscribe from any of these emails in their account settings.

**For our online advertisements, we utilize a system called Adsense that is provided by Google.** Adsense is a well-known product by a major company that is in use by hundreds of thousands of websites worldwide. Google does not have access to your personal information from our website, but will do an automated scan of the contents of our pages in order to provide context-sensitive advertising. Google will also track clicks of their advertisements. We are not able to preview the advertisements beforehand, but have the ability to block advertisements when we see them shown. We do our best to monitor the advertising and we try to immediately block any advertisement that seems in anyway offensive or inappropriate. We are in no way responsible for the content of an advertiser’s website if you choose to click on an advertisement. We are in the process of developing a no-advertising version for those that need it. Please contact us for more information.

**We give the creator of the sign up choices about the privacy of his/her sign up form.** We offer multiple security levels that the sign up creator can choose to determine who can see a sign up page, who can sign up on the page, and what is required to sign up for something. The four options are below.

We do not publicly promote or link the web addresses of the sign ups on our site to try and help make sure that only the people you promote your sign up to will see it. In addition, the creator of the sign up can choose whether or not to display the names of the people that have signed up on the sign up form.

**Our employees have access to your account data when needed to help provide the services of our site.** Our employees may view your personal account data in order to help solve a problem that you or another user is having with any part of our service.

**Our site collects anonymous aggregate Data and may choose to make some of this data public.** Our site gathers anonymous aggregate data like web statistics and demographics statistics on our users. This data may be used to help us run our business, attract advertisers/investors, and measure the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. We may choose to share or publicize certain anonymous aggregate data about our site. However, because this data is anonymous and in summary form, no advertisers or third parties could ever contact you because of this.

**Our staff periodically reviews site data for the purpose of developing a better service for our users.  **Our employees can review all data on our site for the purpose of helping us improve the application. For example, we review what themes people are using and the titles of created sign ups so that we can see which events and holidays people find the site useful for. We may periocially view individual sign up forms on our site so that we can understand how people are using the application. It is our policy to never view a “Password-Protected” sign up form unless it relates to a support ticket since users of the password-protected sign up form tend to be most concerned about their data.

**We take precautions, but cannot provide guarantees.** We do our best to secure your data through the programming of our application and by using industry-standard technology. However, we cannot completely guarantee that no part of our system will ever fail or be compromised. If you ever suspect that our site has contributed to your personal information being compromised, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/help) immediately so that we can investigate and try to resolve the matter.
