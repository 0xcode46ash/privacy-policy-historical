# Privacy Policy

Let’s face it. You came to this page because you are concerned about your privacy. You don’t know us and honestly… you just don’t trust us. Am I right? That’s perfectly understandable. There are a lot of fraudulent sites on the internet.

We started this company to help churches, temples, schools, soccer moms, coaches, room parents, and people just like us organize their lives. We want to be a company with integrity that will simplify life for our users, not take advantage them. So if any of the items below are unclear or you have further questions, please contact us.

Our Policy:

  
**We do not knowingly add users to our website without permission.** A person can be added to our site when they sign up themselves or a friend invites them to a sign up form. If a friend adds your information to our site and you do not want to be a part of our service, just [contact us](https://web.archive.org/help) and our staff will delete you from our system.

**We do not sell or distribute your personally identifiable information (PII) to third party vendors.** Your personal information is used as part of the sign up application and is available to the administrator(s) of the sign ups you are involved in, but we do not display your contact information publicly on our site or sell it to third party vendors.

**We promise not to bother you with unwanted emails, and we allow you to control what emails you receive.** You will, of course, receive emails as part of the SignUpGenius service including invites to sign up forms, status updates, and reminder notifications. In addition, we have an email newsletter that is sent out periodically to members that have created sign ups with information on new features and promotions. Users who have not created a sign up will only receive email newsletters if they choose to opt-in to receiving them. Users can unsubscribe from any of these emails by clicking on the 'Unsubscribe' link in one of those emails.

**We give the creator of the sign up choices about the privacy of his/her sign up form and what data he/she will collect.** We offer multiple security settings that the sign up creator can choose to determine who can see a sign up page, who can sign up on the page, and what is required to sign up for something. We let the sign up creator make the choices. SignUpGenius does not require contact information from members in order for them to participate on a sign up, however, we do give the sign up creator the ability to require contact information. The type of data collected may include:

We do not publicly promote or link the web addresses of the sign ups on our site to try and help make sure that only the people you promote your sign up to will see it. The sign up creator has the choice on whether to promote the sign up page publicly or to a select group of people.

**Our employees have access to your account data when needed to help provide the services of our site.** Our employees may view your personal account data in order to help solve a problem that you or another user is having with any part of our service. If you make a payment on our site, our employees do not have access to your full credit card number.

**Our site collects anonymous aggregate data and may choose to make some of this data public.** Our site gathers anonymous aggregate data like web statistics and demographics statistics on our users. This data may be used to help us run our business, attract advertisers/investors, and measure the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. We may choose to share or publicize certain anonymous aggregate data about our site. However, because this data is anonymous and in summary form, no advertisers or third parties could ever contact you because of this. For details about the aggregate data, see the "Web Analytics" section in the technical details at the bottom of this page.

**For our online advertisements, we do our best to avoid inappropriate or offensive ads.  **Advertising that you see on our site comes from one of two sources. First, an advertisement could be from a company that we partnered with directly. Alternately, an advertisement could be provided to us by an advertising network that programmatically fills the ad slot. We utilize Google's DoubleClick Ad Exchange and Google Adsense to automatically fill a high percentage of our advertising inventory. For ads that are provided programmatically, we do attempt to filter out sensitive or controversial categories where possible through our account settings. While we do not manually preview every ad before it is served, we periodically monitor the advertising and block any advertisement that we deem offensive or inappropriate. We are in no way responsible for the content of an advertiser's website if you choose to click on an advertisement. We also offer a [no-advertising version](http://www.signupgenius.com/index.cfm?go=o.DisplayProducts) for those that need it. 

**We allow and may assist third-party ad networks or vendors in collecting non-personally identifiable information (non-PII) in order to serve relevant advertising both on our site and elsewhere.** Like many web sites, we partner with ad networks that utilize contextual marketing, which is targeted advertising based on user data like web behavior. Ads on our site or in our emails may utilize data collected on other sites. Conversely, data collected on our site or via our emails may impact ads seen on other sites. Information gathered is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites). For the technical details and opt-out information, please see the "Third-Party Ad Networks" section below.

**Our staff periodically reviews site data for the purpose of developing a better service for our users.  **Our employees can review all data on our site for the purpose of helping us improve the application. For example, we review what themes people are using and the titles of created sign ups so that we can see which events and holidays people find the site useful for. We may periocially view individual sign up forms on our site so that we can understand how people are using the application.

**We take precautions, but cannot provide guarantees.** We do our best to secure your data through the programming of our application and by using industry-standard technology. However, we cannot completely guarantee that no part of our system will ever fail or be compromised. If you ever suspect that our site has contributed to your personal information being compromised, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/help) immediately so that we can investigate and try to resolve the matter.

Technical Details:

  
**Cookies**  
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's servers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are required for the SignUpGenius service. We use cookies to track and record user session information. We do not use permanent cookies, but will require users to login periodically to our site in order to help protect your account information.  

**Log Files**  
Like many other Web sites, SignUpGenius.com makes use of log files. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, type of browser, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement around the site, and gather demographic information.

**Web Analytics**  
In addition to our own programming, we use Google Analytics to compile aggregrate statistics. Google Analytics is a web analysis service provided by Google. Google utilizes the data collected to track and examine the use of SignUpGenius.com, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services. Google may use the data collected to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. SignUpGenius may utilize the following features of Google Analytics: Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, and the Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. Personal data that is collected may include: cookie data, usage data, geographic data, demographic data, and interest data. For more info, visit the [Google Privacy Center](http://www.google.com/privacy.html). Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the [Google's Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads?hl=en). Google also offers an [opt-out browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

**Third-Party Ad Networks**  
Google Adsense and DoubleClick Ad Exchange are the primary ad networks that we partner with. The use of cookies and/or web beacons to collect data is used in their ad serving process. SignUpGenius does not have access to this data. Google uses the DART cookie to serve ads to our users based on their previous visits to our sites and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting [Google's Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads?hl=en). For further details on Google and their privacy policy, see the [Google Privacy Center](http://www.google.com/privacy.html).

In addition, SignUpGenius allows other trusted third-party companies or vendors to collect certain information when you visit our web site. These companies may utilize cookies, pixels or other technologies to collect and use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., hashed data, click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, or other non-personally identifiable data) during your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit the websites of the Digital Advertising Alliance at [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/) and Networking Advertising Initiative at [www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).

Additionally, emails we send may contain a bit of code known as a "web beacon." This code allows us to understand the time and date of when a user has opened an email and when he/she has utilized a link within the email to visit a website. Our web beacons do not collect personally identifiable information. Users wishing to disable our web beacons should do so by turning images "off" in their email client (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express). Please see your email client for more information.
