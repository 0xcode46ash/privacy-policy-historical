# Privacy Policy - SignalFx

## SignalFx Privacy Policy

##### Last Updated: February 12, 2015

Protecting your privacy is very important to us. We are providing this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect and use the information that we receive when you use our website located at www.signalfx.com (the “ **Site** ”), our documentation accessible via our Site and the SignalFx software service. To make this Privacy Policy easier to read, the Site, the SignalFx software service and associated documentation are collectively called the “ **Services.** ” This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. Any information that we collect is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the time that Information is collected. We may, however, modify and revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you of those changes by posting them on the Site or by sending you an email or other notification, and we will indicate when those changes will become effective. Also, please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized words used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Services Agreement.

### How do we collect and use information?

Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder) and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.

_Personal Identifiable Information_. If you create an Account and subscribe to our software service, we will collect certain information that can be used to identify you (“ **PII** ”) such as your name, email address, postal address and telephone number. In addition, we may require you to provide certain billing information, such as a credit card number so that we can bill you for use of the Services. If you sign up for more information about or through our Services, including our newsletter, we collect PII such as your name and email address.

_Other Information_. When you create an Account or sign up for more information about SignalFx, we will also ask you to provide the name of the company for which you work, if applicable. We may also ask you to provide additional information about your company as it pertains to the potential use of the Services.

_Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies_. Like many website owners, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information. “ **Cookies** ” are small text files that are placed on your hard drive by a Web server when you access our Services. We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you have logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please note, however, that if you do not accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies on your hard drive. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by such third parties. “ **Web Beacons** ” (also known as clear gifs or page tags) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages or in an e-mail.

_Information Related to Use of the Services_. Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (“ **Log Data** ”). Log Data may include information such as a user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a user was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a user browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a user clicked on and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to fight spam, malware and identity theft. We also use the IP Address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.

### What Information Do We Share With Third Parties?

We will not share any PII that we have collected from you except as described below:

_Information Shared with Our Services Providers_. We may engage third party service providers to work with us to administer the Services; for example, we use third party service providers to help with credit card processing. These third-party services providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf and are expressly obligated not to disclose or use your PII for any other purpose.

_Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions_. If we are acquired as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, your PII may be disclosed or transferred to the third-party acquirer in connection with the transaction.

_Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others_. We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas); (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in general; and (iii) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.

### The Security of Your Information

We take reasonable measures to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.

### Links to Other Sites

Our Services may contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide on or to a third-party website or service is provided directly to the owner of the website or service and is subject to that party’s privacy policy. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to such websites or services and we are not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of those websites or services. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of other websites and services that you access.

### Modifying Your Information

_Your Account_. You can access and modify the PII associated with your Account in the Services. If you want us to delete your PII and/or your Account, please contact us at [info@signalfx.com](mailto:info@signalfx.com) with your request. We’ll take steps to delete your information as soon as is practicable, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.

_Managing Communications_. We may send you product information, announcements, surveys, newsletters, developer updates, and event information or other marketing or commercial e-mails if you are an Account holder or a visitor who has provided your email address to us. You can opt out of receiving these email communications or update your e-mail preferences at any time by using the appropriate links within the footer of each email. If you are an Account holder, we may also send you email from time to time for operational purposes, such as to verify your account, billing or system maintenance. We will send you these emails as long as you are an Account holder.

### International Transfer

Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may transfer your PII to the United States and process it there.

### Our Policy Toward Children

Our Services are not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected PII of a child under 13 we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.
