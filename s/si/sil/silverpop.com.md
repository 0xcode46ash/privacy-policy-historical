# Privacy

**Effective Date: 8/1/2005**

[](http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.silverpop.com&sealid=101)Silverpop has created this privacy statement ("Statement") in order to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Because we gather important information from our customers and visitors, we have established this Statement as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices. Visitors and customers can update their personal information by visiting our personal preference page at <http://www.silverpop.com/preferences/>.

 **Information Collection and Usage**  

Silverpop requires customers who request information, and subsequently register to use our products and services to provide contact information such as their name, company name, address, phone number and email address and later financial qualification and billing information such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the number of users within the customer's organization.   This data is typically collected offline as part of the customer provisioning process. Silverpop typically asks for marketing information via an online form when a customer or visitor requests information about our products and services. This information often includes name, company name, address, phone number, email address, title, and additional company information such as annual revenues, number of employees, and industry.  Silverpop uses the collected information to set up accounts for customers and their respective companies. We may also use the information to contact prospective customers to further discuss their interest in Silverpop, our products and services and to send information on Silverpop.  We may send our email newsletter and notices of promotions and upcoming events, if the customer or visitor has so opted to receive these communications. Silverpop customers will automatically be subscribed to our email newsletter as part of the set up process. All customers have the opportunity to choose to opt out from receiving our newsletter. Customer information will not be shared or distributed.

Silverpop customers will be asked to provide an email address when registering for usage of Silverpop products and services. This is used to send notification of product updates and service and support information. Customers can choose to opt out of receiving these notifications. Again, customer information will not be shared or distributed.   
Except as explicitly stated at the time Silverpop requests information, or as explicitly defined in our Terms of Service, we do not disclose to any third party the information provided. All financial and billing information we collect is used solely to check qualifications of prospective customers and to invoice our customers for their usage of Silverpop products and services. This billing information is not used by Silverpop for marketing and/or promotional purposes.

Silverpop uses a third party for credit card processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided except for the sole purpose of credit card processing.

Silverpop uses pixel tags and other methods to gather information about the emails we send to our registered users and recipients of emails sent by our registered users to others. Pixel tags are tiny graphic files that are included in our HTML-encoded email messages. When such a message is opened in an HTML-capable email program, the recipient's computer will access Silverpop's servers to retrieve the pixel tag file, allowing Silverpop to record and store information such as email address, date and time the recipient viewed the email message, if the recipient's email program is capable of receiving HTML, and other logging information. Silverpop uses this information to optimize delivery of future messages to specific recipients and to provide information to registered users with respect to emails they send through the Silverpop System.

Silverpop maintains log files tracking IP addresses to analyze trends, help diagnose problems with our servers and to monitor traffic/usage in order to provide better service to our customers and visitors.

Silverpop uses cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to improve the convenience and efficiency of your experience when using our products and services. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive tied to statistical information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information in Silverpop products and email messages. You can always choose to not accept cookies, but you may not be able to use some of the Silverpop products and services.   Some of our business partners, such as our web analytics provider, use cookies on our site. These cookies are used to track visitor behavior on our web site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Silverpop only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.

 **A Note to Recipients of Email Messages from Silverpop Users**

Silverpop does not retain email address information after our users delete from our servers. Silverpop does not monitor or limit our users from creating email messages. We do, however, quickly and fervently respond to notification of violations or abuses of Silverpop Terms of Service, including failure to honor opt-outs.

 **Other Information**

Users of Silverpop will place email address lists and digital content on Silverpop's servers. Silverpop does not monitor content or review lists. Silverpop's servers use the content to construct email messages and the address lists to deliver messages. Silverpop will not use user-provided content or email address lists for any purpose whatsoever other than to construct and send messages as intended by the user providing the list and/or content. Email lists will never be used by Silverpop for solicitation nor will they ever be provided to any third party or be accessible through Silverpop by any user other than the user providing the list.

 **Disclosure of Data**

Silverpop will only disclose your Data (as defined collectively above under the topic Information Collection and Usage), the contents of your private communications, or the contact information of your recipients if required to do so by law, or as otherwise stated in this Statement, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Silverpop; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Silverpop and others, including among other things to enforce our Terms of Service; (3) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of its members or the public; (4) to correct technical problems and malfunctions in how we provide our service to you and to technically process your information; (5) to take precautions against liability; (6) to respond to claims that information you have submitted to Silverpop has violated the rights or interests of a third party; or (7) as permitted by law or to provide information to law enforcement agencies. Also, certain technical processing of email messages and their content are required: (1) for sending and receiving messages; (2) to conform to connecting networks' technical requirements; (3) to conform to the limitations of the Service; or (4) for other similar technical connecting requirements.

It is possible that as we continue to develop our business, Silverpop may be acquired. In such a transaction, customer information may be transferred to the acquiring entity. Users will be notified via email prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information if users’ personally identifiable information will be used in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section.

 **Other Web Sites; Links**

Silverpop's web site, or messages created with Silverpop Services, may contain links to other Web sites. Silverpop is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

As described above, third parties may independently collect information about you when you view ads or other communications from third parties through Silverpop products or services. If you do not want those companies to collect information about you, please contact them directly.

 **Changes to this Statement**

Silverpop reserves the right to make changes to this Statement and to our information gathering and dissemination practices and will provide notification of the change with a minimum of thirty (30) business days prior to the changes taking effect. If as a result of this change, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our Opt-out and Update of Information section.

 **Opt-out and Update of Information**

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following instructions included in each newsletter or communication.  If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire to receive specific mailings, you may correct, update or delete it by making the change on our preference center page [www.silverpop.com/preferences/](http://www.silverpop.com/preferences/).

 **Security**

Silverpop takes your security seriously and takes reasonable proactive steps to protect your information.  Silverpop has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. It is important to note that no data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure and we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party “hackers” from illegally obtaining stored or transmitted information.
