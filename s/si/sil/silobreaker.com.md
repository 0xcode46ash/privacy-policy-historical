# Silobreaker

Silobreaker is committed to protecting your privacy in accordance with the law and in particular complies with the data protection principles laid down by the Data Protection Act 1998 (the **Act** ). The identity of the registered "Data Controller" for the purposes of the Act is **Silobreaker Limited**. 

This privacy policy explains what information we collect about users of the Silobreaker web service (the **Website** ) and how we will use it. 

Please note that the Website contains links to other websites which are outside of our control and which are not covered by this privacy policy. You are advised that the operators of such websites may collect information from you which may be used in a manner inconsistent with the Silobreaker privacy policy. 

### The information we collect

When you register to use the Website we will ask for some of your personal information which may include your name, e-mail address, sex, country of residence, year of birth, areas of interest, job title, company name, billing address, credit card information and similar. We (or our agents or subcontractors) may check some of the information that you provide to us against third party databases to confirm that it is accurate. 

The Website uses "cookies" (small pieces of information stored on your computer's hard drive by your browser) which enable us to personalise your use of the Website. The cookies are necessary for the Website to work properly and shall not be turned off in your browser or fire wall settings. 

### How we may use such information

We gather this information to allow us to personalize your use of the Website; to operate e-mail update systems, to process registrations and payment for user subscriptions; to run competitions; and for security reasons. We may also use the information to communicate with you on any matter relating to the provision of the Website in general. 

You confirm that you will only enter personal information about yourself and that such information will be true. 

We may use aggregate information and statistics for the purposes of monitoring Website usage in order to help us develop the Website and our service and may provide such aggregate information to third parties. 

We will provide some of your details to WorldPay. WorldPay is part of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group and is the company which processes the credit card payments of user subscriptions on our behalf. For more information about WorldPay and the security around credit card payments, please go to the [Security](https://web.archive.org/web/20061029134739id_/http%3A//www.silobreaker.com/Corporate/security.aspx) section of the website. 

We or our agents or sub-contractors may occasionally contact you by e-mail to ask you for feedback and comments on our services. 

We (and any group company) may also wish to provide you with information about special features of the Website, user tips, events, special coverage or any special services or products we think may be of interest to you. If you would rather not receive this information, there is a section in the registration form where you can indicate this. 

We will not rent or sell your personal information, other than as part of a sale of the whole or a substantial part of the assets of Silobreaker Limited without ensuring that suitable arrangements are in place to protect your privacy (unless required by law to do so). 

You agree that any successor operator of our business may use your personal information on the same basis as we do. 

We will not disclose your personal details to third parties except as outlined above or in the unlikely event that we are required to do so by court order or other legal requirement. 

### Updating your details

If any of the information that you have provided to us changes (for example if you change your e-mail address) please let us know the correct details by updating your profile under the "Edit My Profile" section in the Website. 

### Security

The Silobreaker website is secured by a thawte SSL Web Server Certificate with full authentification capable of up to 256-bit encryption (depending on your web browser's capability). This ensures that the information exchanged between you and Silobreaker regarding registration and payment details is protected and remains private and confidential while in transit between our web server and your web browser. Look for the thawte Trusted Site Seal on the Website, on which you can click to verify the certificate's validity. thawte is a leading provider of internet security services, a public Certificate Authority and part of VeriSign, Inc. 

### Your consent

By submitting your information you consent to the use of that information as set out in this policy. If we change our privacy policy at any time (and we reserve the right to do so) we will post the changes on this page and may place notices on other pages of the Website, so that you may be aware of the information we collect and how we use it. Continued use of the service will signify that you agree to any such changes. 

Because the Internet infrastructure is global, the information you provide may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) that do not have similar data protection legislation during use as set out in this policy (for example we may decide at a later date to host the Website on servers located outside the EEA). However, we have taken the steps outlined above to try to improve the security of your information. Should we wish to transfer data for processing to a country outside the EEA we will ensure that suitable arrangements are in place to protect your privacy. By submitting your information you consent to these transfers.
