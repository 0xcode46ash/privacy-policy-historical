# siliconrepublic.com - Ireland's Technology News Service - Privacy Policy

Siliconrepublic.com has created this privacy statement to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information-gathering and dissemination practices of siliconrepublic.com.

 **1\. Information Automatically Logged**

We use your IP address and log user agents and referring address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our website and to identify unique users. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information.

 **2\. Information Usage**

Siliconrepublic.com uses the information we gather for these general purposes:

  * To enhance the user experience by determining how well each page performs. This helps siliconrepublic.com continue to build a better service for you
  * To fulfil your requests for certain products and services, such as sending out electronic newsletters
  * To send you information you agreed to receive about topics we think will be of interest to you.



 **3\. Personally Identifiable Information provided to siliconrepublic.com**

Siliconrepublic.com will make your personally identifiable information available to other companies or people when:

  * We have your consent to share the information
  * We have engaged companies to work with or on behalf of siliconrepublic.com to provide a product or service that you have requested, such as opt-in email announcements
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; or we believe that your actions violate applicable laws or threaten the rights, property or safety of siliconrepublic.com, our users, or others.



Siliconrepublic.com aggregates personally identifiable information and discloses such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing, promotional and other purposes. We do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally.

If we sell siliconrepublic.com, we may transfer some or all of your information as a part of the sale in order that the service being provided to you may continue or for other business purposes.

 **4\. Form Submissions**

Certain online purchase options require users to give us financial information (such as their credit card numbers) and demographic information (such as their address, etc.). Financial information that is collected is used solely to bill the user for products and services. You can be assured that our internal routines do not allow unauthorised access to our customer information. Credit card details needed with online payment are classified as extremely sensitive and this information is stored in a proper way without unauthorised personnel being able to gain access. All aspects of information storage are safeguarded in a secure manner.

 **5\. ‘Email this article to your colleagues’ service**

A user can electronically forward a news story to someone else by clicking the link at the bottom of a story. The user provides a valid email address for both the sender and the recipient in order to ensure that the service functions properly and to inform the recipient who sent the story. There is also an option to include a name, which is only used for the email salutation. None of this information is used for any other purpose.

 **6\. Irish Data Protection Commissioner**

Further information on your data privacy rights are available on the website of the Irish Data Protection Commissioner at [www.dataprotection.ie](http://www.dataprotection.ie/).

Information requested may include contact information (such as name and delivery address) and demographic information (such as address, age and income level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

Promotions and competitions that run on siliconrepublic.com may be sponsored by companies other than siliconrepublic.com or may be co-sponsored by siliconrepublic.com and another company.
