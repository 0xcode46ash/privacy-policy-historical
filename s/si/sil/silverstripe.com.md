### Server logs

SilverStripe uses server logs to ensure smooth operation of our services and for general site and application maintenance. Like almost all Internet servers, logged information may include timestamps, your client IP address (as it appears to the server), and the pages you visit. Our server logs will not be shared with any third party. We may however elect to publish aggregate statistics on visitor activity from time to time based on log information. We will never publish any personally identifiable information.

SilverStripe's sites contain links to other websites which are not owned or controlled by SilverStripe. This privacy policy only applies to SilverStripe's websites, and we are not responsible for the privacy policies of other websites.

Similarly, while we moderate user contributions such as blog comments or forum posts on our sites, we are not responsible for such content and may not agree with the content of these comments or posts.
