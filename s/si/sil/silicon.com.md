A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user.   
silicon.com does not automatically set up cookies when a user visits the site - this is voluntary. Users are in control of setting up cookies - the advantage for them is that they do not have to log into the site every time they visit, thereby saving time. If a user wishes to set up a cookie this can be done in the "Personalise" section in the site. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.

8. Surveys, Competitions and Promotions

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on the main inbox of silicon.com so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
