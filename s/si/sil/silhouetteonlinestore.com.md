# Silhouette Online Store - Privacy Policy

###  CATEGORIES

|  Silhouette America knows that you (our customer) care how information about you is used, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This Privacy Policy describes the kinds of information we collect about you, where we get it, how we safeguard it, and with whom (if anyone) we may share it.

This website may contain links to other sites. Silhouette America is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.

## What Information Do We Collect?

We obtain information about you in various ways – mostly from you. For example, we collect information from you when you set up a user account or place an order for Silhouette America products or services. Such information may include your name, address, email address, bank account information, or credit card numbers. Your use of any Silhouette America website may also give us information about your interests, preferences, spending, and shopping patterns. If you send an email message or other communication to us, we retain that information as well.

Like many other websites, Silhouette America websites may use “cookies,” which are small pieces of computer information that make your Internet experience quicker and more convenient. Cookies can also help us to understand how you (and other customers) use our service, allowing us to improve and tailor our services for your benefit. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, however, and not on our site. Aside from Silhouette’s cookies, Google may store additional cookies for analytical purposes. [Click here](http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/) for more information about Google’s cookies and how they’re used.

## What Do We Do with Your Information?

We use your information in connection with delivering products and services to you, such as processing orders. Some of your information also helps us to provide a secure and personalized experience. Contact information may be used to send you information about Silhouette America or its products, including promotional materials. You may request that we not send such information to you. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, you may use tools provided for that purpose on the website, the “unsubscribe” option included in emails that we may send you, or contact customer service and have them adjust preferences on your account. 

## Disclosure of Information to Others

We do not sell, rent, or loan your information to third parties without your permission.

We may sometimes employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending mail, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. Such companies and individuals are given access to personal information that is needed to perform their functions, but they are not authorized to use it for other purposes.

We do not disclose information regarding your credit cards or bank accounts except to those having a need to know in connection with processing orders and payments.

We will release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law, enforce terms of service, or protect the rights, property, or safety of Silhouette America, our customers, or others. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations to help prevent fraud.

## Information Security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect your information. 

## Non-Customers

This Privacy Policy is directed at Silhouette America customers, but it protects all persons who provide personal information to Silhouette America. If you provide personal information to us through the use of any of our websites or by any other means, we will protect your information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you terminate an account or otherwise stop doing business with us, we will continue to protect your information as described in this Privacy Policy. 

## Privacy Protection for Children

In compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPA), we do not knowingly provide any Internet-based service to persons under the age of 18. We will make reasonable efforts to avoid receiving personally identifying information of any kind from persons under the age of 18. 

## Non-Identifying Information

This Privacy Policy applies to personally identifying information. Silhouette America may use and disclose non-identifying information for any purpose.
