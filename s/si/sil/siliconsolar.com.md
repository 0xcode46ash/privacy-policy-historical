**Silicon Solar's   ONLINE SECURITY STATEMENT**

We understand that many consumers are concerned about Internet security. Silicon Solar employs industry-leading technologies to store sensitive information and protect it while in transit over the Internet. The following Security Statement describes the technologies we use and provides additional details about how we handle sensitive data like credit card information. We want you to be able to shop at Silicon Solar with complete confidence. If for any reason you feel uncomfortable shopping with us online.

**THE TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE DATA**

We work hard to protect the information that you send to us while it is in  route to and from our sites. To provide secure transmission, Silicon Solar employs Secure Sockets Layer technology (SSL) on those pages that involve sensitive information such as credit card numbers. SSL, which is supported by a vast majority of Internet browsers available today, is the most commonly employed method of secure, encrypted communication used on the Internet. 

We have also obtained THAWte™ digital security certificates for all of our websites. THAWte™ is an independent third party that authenticates the identity of others on the Internet. By registering with THAWte™, we provide you a method of independently authenticating that the entity you are dealing with over the Internet is actually Silicon Solar.

But we don't stop there—we also work very hard to make sure the information you send us is stored and managed securely once we receive it. All data collected is stored on site and is protected by multiple levels of data and structural security.
