# Privacy Policy | Six Pack Abs

[](http://www.sixpackabs.com/)   
  


Welcome to SixPackAbs.com, a website operated by Six Pack Abs, LLC. SixPackAbs.com has created this privacy policy to show our commitment to protecting your privacy, and to inform you of our information-gathering and dissemination practices. This privacy policy breaks down the information we collect through our website, how we use this information, how you can opt out of certain uses of the information we collect, and how SixPackAbs.com can make changes to this privacy policy.

**Children’s Privacy**

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have inadvertently obtained personal information on a child under the age of 13, that information will be deleted from our systems. 

**Information We Collect and Why We Collect It**

We collect your personal information in order to provide a more customized experience. We collect two types of information from you:

  1. Information that may be used to identify you individually, like your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, date of birth, etc. (“personal information”), and
  2. Non-personal information, such as internet IP addresses, the type of web browser you are using, and other information about user activities on our website(s) (“nonpersonal information”).



**Personal Information:** We specifically request personal information from you at certain points on and off our website(s). For example, when you call us, sign up for our newsletter, visit or subscribe to our website(s), use our mobile or web applications or when you purchase an item or service, we collect personal information to complete the transaction. This information may include, without limitation, your name, shipping and billing addresses, telephone number, email address, credit card information, and date of birth. If you apply to join our Affiliate Program, we may collect information about your business, including, without limitation, your (or your organization’s) name, email address, street address, telephone number, tax identification number, and information about your Web site (e.g., the URL, the number of unique users and page views, the demographics of your user base, etc.). From time to time, we may also request or obtain personal information about you and your interests in surveys, contest/sweepstakes entry forms, our social mediaweb sites, or in other ways. You may always choose not to provide us with your personal information; however, this may limit our ability to provide you with a specific product or service or information, or to offer you personalized content.

**Nonpersonal Information:** When you visit our website(s), we also collect nonpersonal information, such as your IP address, which is a number that can be used to identify your location and Internet Service Provider. We may also collect the other information such as the type of browser or device you are using, the URL from which you came to our Web site(s) and the URLs that you visited on our Web site(s). A URL is the full address of a Web site page, which may contain some personal or identifying information about the person who is viewing it.

**Information from Other Sources:** We may collect information about you from other sources, including through interactive applications (such as mobile devices/applications and third-party services) and from commercially available sources (such as data aggregators and public databases). For example, if you access third-party services (such as Facebook Connect) through or in connection with our Web site(s), we collect information available about you through those services, including, but not limited to, personal information as well as publicly observable data, such as activities on blogs, videos, and other online postings.

**Use of Cookies:** We also use a feature of your browser called a cookie to assign identification to your computer that may be placed by us or a third party with whom we partner. Cookies allow us to better understand your preferences and personalize the content on our Web sites to give you a better overall shopping experience. The unique user ID contained within your cookie automatically identifies your computer—but not you—to our servers every time you visit our Web site(s). Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out the identity of any user, but may be combined with identity information in our log files. You can turn off the cookie feature by using your browser preference options, but you may not be able to utilize some of the features or services on our Web sites properly. Current versions of many Web browsers offer enhanced user controls for the placement and duration of cookies. Search for “cookies” under your Web browser’s Help menu for more information on the cookie management features available to you.

**Use of Pixel Tags:** We also collect information through the use of “pixel tags” on our Web sites and in email messages we may send to you that may be placed by us or a third party with whom we partner. Pixel tags, also known as “Web beacons,” are tiny graphic files, not visible to the human eye, that are included in HTML-encoded email messages. When such a message is opened in an HTML-capable email program, the recipient’s computer will access our server to retrieve the pixel tag file, allowing us to record and store, along with the recipient’s email address, the date and time the recipient viewed the email message, the fact that the recipient’s email program is capable of receiving HTML-encoded email, and other standard logging information. The pixel tag may also see or read cookies. SixPackAbs.com may use pixel tags in order to measure and understand traffic better, to track visitor behavior to improve user experience, and for tracking promotional and marketing campaign response, among others. You can disable the pixel tag feature by changing your browser settings to omit images and disable Javascript; or there are commercial software packages available that can omit pixel tags and most advertisements.

**How does SixPackAbs.com use or disclose the information it collects?**

We may also use your personal information to improve our products, services and advertising, personalize our Web site(s), target advertising or promotions that may be of interest to you, or conduct business that we feel would be of interest to you. On occasion, we may also contact you about SixPackAbs.com’s or any of its business units’ or partners’ products or services that we think you will find useful.

For information about opting out of such communications, please see our Opt-Out Policy section below.

**Co-Branded Offers:** SixPackAbs.com occasionally partners with third parties (“Affiliated Company”) to offer additional products or services that we feel may be useful to you. In the event you request information or purchase a particular product or service from an Affiliated Company, we may disclose to the Affiliated Companies your personal information such as your name, e-mail address, shipping address, phone number and other contact information, and if you purchased a product, your credit card information. If you do not want us to disclose your personal information to the Affiliated Companies, please refer to the Opt-Out Policy below.

**Customer Service Issues and Contacts:** We may use your personal information to contact you in response to customer service complaints you have submitted, to address a problem affecting your use of a product or service, or to verify information concerning a transaction.

**Transaction Processing:** When you make a purchase, we may need to provide personal information, including information such as your shipping address, billing information, telephone number, and credit card information, to third parties, including product manufacturers and shipping companies, as necessary solely to complete the transaction.

**Legal Requirements:** We may, in our sole discretion, disclose personal information when we deem necessary or appropriate to law enforcement or other entities or third parties as required by law or to protect our rights or the rights of others, to prevent harm to persons or property, to fight fraud, identity theft, or otherwise to comply with the law or legal process, to respond to claims, to protect our systems and customers, to ensure the integrity and operation of our business and systems, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of SixPackAbs.com and its employees or others.

**Business and Accounting Disclosures:** We may also disclose non-identifying transaction information to third parties for the purpose of accounting and record keeping. We may also disclose aggregate user data or nonpersonal information in order to describe our services to prospective business partners, advertisers, and others, but will do so only in a form that does not identify individual users.

**Third-Party Tools/Services:** At various points and pages on our Web site(s), you may be able to access or utilize tools and/or services offered by or in conjunction with third parties, including tools and services in connection with third-party “social media” and other sites that would allow personal information to be transferred to such third parties (for example, Facebook Connect). These third parties have separate data collection and privacy practices independent from ours, and thus SixPackAbs.com cannot be responsible for their policies or activities. Please contact those third parties directly if you have questions about their privacy policies.

**Other Disclosures:** Occasionally, we may disclose personal information in other circumstances, but we will only do this if we have explained at the time we collect the information the purpose for which it will be disclosed.

SixPackAbs.com uses industry-standard security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control, and we make good-faith efforts to store your personal information in a secure operating environment.

**Other Web Sites; Links**

On our Web site(s) and in communication with you, we may include links or referrals to businesses and Web sites operated by our business partners, affiliates, advertisers, and others.

Please contact those third parties directly if you have questions about their privacy policies.

**Community Center/Community Chat Rooms/Message Boards**

Our Web site(s) includes online forums, chat rooms, message boards, and other interactive technologies that allow comments, messages, emails, and postings to be associated with a user’s name or email address.

You may change or update the personal information we have collected by contacting our Customer Service Department or sending an email to contact@sixpackabs.com. Please include your email address, your order number, the name of the product you purchased, and the information you wish to change. In addition, you may delete the cookie stored on your computer, which will cause our system to perceive you as a new user with no known user data. You may also set your browser to reject cookies, but doing so may prevent you from using some of our services.

**Users Based Outside of the USA**

Like almost every Web site and business, SixPackAbs.com and its websites(s) may be accessed by an international audience. By visiting any of our websites(s) and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be processed for the purposes identified in this policy. In addition, such data may be stored on servers located in the United States of America or otherwise outside your resident jurisdiction; such jurisdictions may have less stringent privacy practices than your own. By providing us with your data, you consent to the transfer of such data.

**What happens to my information if SixPackAbs.com is sold to or merges with another company?**

It is possible that SixPackAbs and/or any of our assets may be acquired by an unrelated third party. In such a transaction, as the owner of this customer information, we may disclose or sell the information as an asset of the company in conjunction with the sale of our company or the sale of a portion of our assets to a third party. While we will endeavor to require the successor company to maintain this privacy policy, we cannot guarantee that our policy will remain in effect.

**Changes to This Policy**

This policy may change from time to time. If we make any substantive changes to the policy in the future with regard to how we use your information, we will post those changes on our website(s) in this location together with the date of the last update. Your continued business relationship or use of the website(s) after the changes are posted constitutes your agreement to the changes, both with regard to information we have previously collected from you and with regard to information we collect from you in the future.
