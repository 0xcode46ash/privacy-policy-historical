**External Linking Policy**

**Purpose and Disclaimer**

The City permits the establishment of external hyperlinks on its official website only if the links strictly comply with this policy. In establishing and maintaining its official website, the City does not intend to create any forum or other means for public discourse. Rather, the sole and limited purpose of the permitted external links is to provide information about the City and its government for residents, businesses and visitors. The City does not endorse or provide preferential treatment to any third party websites or associated organizations or persons. Additionally, the City does not control third party sites and therefore does not warrant that third party sites are accurate or, reliable, or that they have operational links.

**Linking Criteria**

Consistent with the foregoing purpose, it is the City's policy to limit external links to the following: a) Other governmental agencies; b) Entities with which the City has an existing formal, contractual relationship; c) Entities or events that receive funding from the City or are otherwise sponsored by the City; d) Entities that contribute to City initiatives and that the City wishes to acknowledge; e) Applications that use datasets from DataSF.org; f) the City's Chamber of Commerce and the San Francisco Travel Association; and g) Webpages that provide free access to traffic and weather information for San Francisco. In addition, the City reserves the right, at any time and without notice, to: a) Deny a link that does not meet the criteria set forth in this policy; b) Deny or discontinue an external link at any time if the website provides or promotes false, slanderous, illegal, infringing or incorrect information; c) Deny or discontinue an external link at any time if a substantial purpose of the linked website is to support or oppose a candidate or ballot measure; d) Remove any external link if the nature of the organization to which the link relates no longer complies with the City's external link policy; e) Revise this policy without prior notice when the City considers such revision to be in its best interests.

**Accessibility Policy**

It is the policy of the City and County of San Francisco that information and services on City and County Web Sites be designed to be accessible to people with disabilities. It is the responsibility of the agency and its web page developers to become familiar with the guidelines for achieving universal accessibility and to apply these principles in designing and creating any official City and County of San Francisco Web site.

According to the latest statistics available from the Bureau of the Census, there are 9.7 million people in the United States who have difficulty seeing the words and letters in ordinary newsprint, equal to 5.0% of the total population. Another 10.9 million people, or nearly 6% of the total population, have difficulty hearing what is said in an ordinary conversation with another person.

The use of the City and County of San Francisco accessibility guidelines will ensure that web sites created by the City and County of San Francisco are developed to serve the largest possible audience. Compliance with these guidelines provides an added benefit to those users with text-based browsers, low-end processors, slow modem connections and/or no multi-media capabilities on their computer. It also allows for access to City and County of San Francisco web sites by new technologies, such as internet phones and personal organizers with internet connectivity.

**Cascading Style Sheets**

This site implements cascading style sheets. Certain early versions of Netscape (4.x and earlier) and Internet Explorer (3.x and earlier) do not fully support this feature, so elements such as links may display differently. If you are experiencing this, you may wish to disable style sheets. You can do this through your browser. In Explorer (5.50), choose Tools, Internet Options, General Tab, Accessibility, and check the "Format documents using my style sheet" feature. In Netscape (4.75), choose Edit, Preferences, Advanced, and turn off the Enable Style Sheets feature.
