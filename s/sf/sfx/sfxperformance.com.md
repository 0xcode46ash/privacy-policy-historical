Use of Cookies  
We may at times also use cookies, which are small pieces of information that a website can store in a designated file on your computer. Cookies allow a web application to respond to you as an individual and to display specialized information to you regarding your search for auto parts. By gathering and remembering information about your preferences, the web application can tailor its operation to your needs, likes, and dislikes. SFX Performance also uses information obtained from cookies to improve our website, and make decisions concerning advertising, product offerings and services. If they prefer, most users have the ability to disable cookies from their Internet browsers, or to receive notification that a cookie is being placed within their computer. At no time do we share this information with other companies.

Advertisements on SFX Performance   
At times, we may permit advertising companies to deliver ads on our website. When you click on these ads, the advertising company may receive anonymous, aggregate information about the volume of ad viewing, but this information is not associated with you personally. SFX Performance does not provide personally identifiable information about its customers or visitors to these or any other advertising company. 

Disclosure to Third Parties   
SFX Performance will not sell or give away to outside parties any personally identifiable information without your consent, except under the following circumstances:

  2. When disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of a customer, SFX Performance or its third parties. SFX Performance may share customer information with selected partners/third parties, for example, to provide you with information about products and services, or to enable you to take advantage of special partner programs. SFX Performance may also use customer information to periodically provide customers with system information or information about new or upgraded products or product recalls. 



SFX Performance also will not, except for reasons stated below, disclose to third parties the contents of any electronic mail or other electronic communications that SFX Performance stores or transmits for its customers.

SFX Performance disclaims any intention to censor, edit, or engage in ongoing review or surveillance of communications stored on or transmitted through its facilities by customers or others. SFX Performance will, however, review, delete, or block access to communications that may harm SFX Performance, its customers or third parties.
