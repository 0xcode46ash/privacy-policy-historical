**Information Gathering**

The information we gather falls into two categories: 1) personal information you voluntarily supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register for an online discussion, enter a contest or provide your e-mail address, and 2) tracking information collected as you navigate through our sites.

For example, we may want to know how long the average reader spends on our site, or which pages or features get the most attention.  
* The Guardian may perform statistical analyses of subscribers and their subscribing and purchasing patterns for product development purposes and to generally inform advertisers about the nature of our subscriber base.  
* We may use demographic and preference information to allow advertising on our Web sites to be targeted, in aggregate, to the users for whom they are most pertinent.  
* We contract with other companies to provide services on our behalf, including credit-card and billing processing, e-mail distribution, list processing and analytics or promotions management.  
* Any information you disclose when posting to a message board, along with your message board screen name or ID, becomes public and may be used by The Guardian for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media.
