# SFMOMA | About Us | About SFMOMA | About the Site | Privacy Policy

* * *

The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art is concerned about protecting the privacy of all SFMOMA website visitors. SFMOMA respects your privacy and your choice not to have your personal information shared with other people. Please read the following to learn more about our policy. Your use of our website indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.

### Collection of Information

SFMOMA does not collect personally identifying data, such as names, addresses, email addresses, and the like, except when voluntarily submitted by website visitors.

In only five situations does SFMOMA request personally identifying data from site visitors: for purchases made in the online SFMOMA MuseumStore; for online purchases of admission and event tickets; to allow you to send emails through the "Share" feature on every web page; for online employment applications; and for event space rental inquiries. Information that SFMOMA collects is used to make our website more useful by helping us learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use. We do not track or record information about individuals and their visits. We may compile and report aggregate statistics about our users — such as numbers, traffic patterns, and related site information — but these statistics include no personally identifying information.

### Disclosure of Information

SFMOMA will not disclose or share any personal information you provide to SFMOMA with any other party without your permission, except if requested to do so in accordance with a court order, subpoena, or similar legal order, and in the event such disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of SFMOMA, its users, and other third parties. SFMOMA will not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others.

### Third Party Processing

Purchases made in the online SFMOMA MuseumStore, online purchases of admission and event tickets, emails sent through the "Share" feature, and online employment applications are processed by third parties who handle all related ordering, processing, and delivery of the products. The third parties' practices in connection with the ordering, processing, and delivery of products are subject to their own privacy policies. You should consult the privacy policies for the [MuseumStore](http://sfmoma.stores.yahoo.net/privacypolicy.html) at [Yahoo!](http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/details.html), online ticket sales at [MuseumTix/Ticketmaster](http://www.museumtix.com/help/privacy.asp?pvt=), emails at [AddThis](http://www.addthis.com/privacy), and online employment applications at [SnapHire](http://sfmoma.snaphire.com/) to ascertain the uses of the personal information submitted to these third parties.

### Links

SFMOMA may provide links to other third party websites, and other websites may provide links to the SFMOMA website. Third party websites operate according to their own terms of use and privacy policies. SFMOMA has no control over such third party websites, and therefore you acknowledge and agree that SFMOMA is not responsible for the availability of such third party sites, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such sites. You further acknowledge and agree that SFMOMA will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such sites.

### Children

SFMOMA does not solicit personal information from children except in connection with the interactive feature [The Country Dog Gentlemen Travel to Extraordinary Worlds](https://web.archive.org/multimedia/interactive_features/81), an educational activity for children, students, and families. Users of this feature provide nicknames and email addresses, which are used only to allow them to save their pictures to the Dogs' Best Friend Gallery and send the pictures by email to the user and to her/his friends and family. We do not retain or disclose these email addresses, which are deleted immediately after sending the pictures. We do not condition a child's participation in the Dogs' Best Friend Gallery upon the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at [edu@sfmoma.org](mailto:edu@sfmoma.org?subject=Country%20Dog%20Gentleman). 

### Changes to Our Policy

SFMOMA may amend this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information, we will notify you by posting a prominent announcement on this page.
