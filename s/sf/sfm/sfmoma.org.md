COLLECTION OF INFORMATION

SFMOMA does not collect personally identifying data, such as names, addresses, email addresses, and the like, except when voluntarily submitted by Web site visitors. 

In only four situations does SFMOMA request personally identifying data from site visitors: for purchases made in the [ SFMOMA MuseumStore](http://store.yahoo.com/sfmoma/index.html); for online purchases of admission tickets; for online employment applications; and for event space rental inquiries. Information that SFMOMA collects is used to make our Web site more useful by helping us learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use. We do not track or record information about individuals and their visits. We may compile and report aggregate statistics about our users — such as numbers, traffic patterns, and related site information — but these statistics include no personally identifying information.  
  
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION

SFMOMA will not disclose or share any personal information you provide to SFMOMA with any other party without your permission, except if requested to do so in accordance with a court order, subpoena, or similar legal order, and in the event such disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of SFMOMA, its users, and other third parties. SFMOMA will not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others.   
  
THIRD PARTY PROCESSING

Purchases made through the MuseumStore, purchases of tickets, and employment applications are processed by third parties who handle all related ordering, processing, and delivery of the products.
