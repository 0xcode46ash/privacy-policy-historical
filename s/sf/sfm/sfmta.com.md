Again, this is general aggregate information and will not be used to identify a particular visitor to the SFMTA website except for security purposes.

Please be aware that your communications with the department through electronic mail, including any information that automatically accompanies such message or that you insert into the message, may be subject to disclosure under public records laws. In addition, the City reserves the right to forward any such communications, or information contained in the communications, to the appropriate law enforcement or governmental authorities where the City determines that such action may be necessary to prevent harm to persons or property or to help facilitate an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, criminal activity, or other unlawful activity, provided that any disclosure of information is not prohibited by state or federal law, including the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 

### Procedure for e-mail commendations and complaints about specific incidents:

A commendation or complaint is received by PSR Staff via telephone, letter, walk-in, e-mail, or Muni website, and as much of the following information as is available and applicable is taken down to process the commendation or complaint: a) Occur Date - date incident happened; b) Occur Time - time of incident; c) Location - where incident happened; d) Line/Route #; e) Direction of Travel; f) Vehicle #; g) Employee ID# or Name, if available; h) Description of Employee; i) Description of Complaint; j) Customer Information.

If a complaint is submitted, customer information is necessary to ensure that the Muni employee is charged with the appropriate rule violation (as per MOU contract with employee union).

All complaints are entered into the PSR database and distributed to the appropriate operating divisions for investigation and resolution. Copies are also sent to other Muni departments when the PSR involves non-operator issues such as bus maintenance.

A letter response acknowledging receipt of complaint is sent to the customer. If a hearing about the employee is necessary, the customer will be notified. The customer must attend the hearing for the complaint to be carried forward.

### Procedure for e-mail sent to the SFMTA webmaster about the SFMTA website:

All mail that relates to the website is handled by the SFMTA Marketing and Community Outreach group. Inquiries are responded to on a first-come, first-serve basis. If mail arrives in the SFMTA webmaster's mailbox that can be more appropriately handled by another department, that mail will be forwarded to the proper department.

### Procedure for e-mail sent regarding general comments and questions about Muni:

The mail comes to the Passenger Services Department for processing. Staff will investigate and respond to all inquiries. Depending on the complexity of the request, it can take 7-10 days to generate a response.
