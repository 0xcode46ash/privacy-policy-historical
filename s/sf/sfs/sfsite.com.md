GORILLA NATION MEDIA'S COMMITMENT  
TO PRIVACY  
GNM is firmly committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users and fostering consumer confidence in the Internet, Internet advertising and direct marketing. We invite all users to contact us at [legal@gorillanation.com](mailto:legal@gorillanation.com) with any questions or concerns.

• **What GNM Does**   
Gorilla Nation™ operates the following interrelated business lines; more information on each may be found at www.gorillanation.com:

Gorilla Nation™ represents Web sites for which it sells and serves online advertisements on behalf of advertiser clients.

• **GNM Promotions** \- GNM's Promotions division develops customized online promotions campaigns such as sweepstakes and other incentive-style marketing campaigns. 

• **GNM Mai** l - GNM Mail assists Web publishers in sending marketing and promotional email messages to online users that have consented to receive promotional email messages. For more information about GNM Mail, contact [info@gorillanation.com](mailto:info@gorillanation.com).

**How GNM's Products and Services Enhance User Privacy and Protect the Property of Advertisers and Web Publishers**

Gorilla Nation™ serves ads to its partner Web sites. The cookies that are employed across our represented websites serve a quantitative function and are not designed to collect and store data profiles on users. They are used to:

• Report to GNM's advertiser and Web site clients the estimated total reach of an ad campaign;  
• Report the frequency with which an ad was shown to a user, and other measurement statistics;  
• Ensure that an advertisement displayed to a user corresponds to the correct click-through destination;  
• Deliver a series of advertisements in the proper sequence; and  
• Limit the number of times a browser is delivered the same advertisement.

Unlike other global ad serving companies, Gorilla Nation™ does not use any of the data collected via cookies for purposes other than those described above. Gorilla Nation Media does not merge personally identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information, and does not otherwise parse, sort, gather, or aggregate user data for use elsewhere. Non-PII is collected by Gorilla Nation™ through session cookies that terminate when the browser is closed.

Gorilla Nation Media™ thus has no reason to offer users the choice to "opt-out" of anything that pertains to Network served ads.

**What User Information Is Collected  
by Email and Promotions**  
Gorilla Nation™ collects two types personally identifiable information only through its Email and Promotions business lines.

**Personally Identifiable Information ("PII")**   
PII is personal information classified as personal to the online consumer, such as name, address, phone number and email address. PII also includes other personal information such as birth-date, zip code, gender, or lifestyle information.

• GNM's Email and Promotions divisions collect PII on an opt-in basis only. Gorilla Nation™ will not collect any PII unless that user voluntarily provides it to GNM. If you do not want your personal information collected online, please do not submit it to surveys, promotions, sweepstakes, or subscriptions.  
•PII is collected by Gorilla Nation™ when online users respond to a survey and provide it, when they register for an email newsletter, register for a product or service online, or enter a sweepstakes promoted by GNM, its subsidiaries or its partners. Selected partners of Gorilla Nation Media™ will share information with Gorilla Nation Media about only their online consumers who have consented to the sharing of their information with third parties.

Furthermore, each individual in the GNM Email database has answered positively to an "opt in" question, or they have voluntarily filled out an Internet survey card to receive email solicitation about products of interest. Gorilla Nation Media and its partners communicate with these users frequently to verify their "opt in" status. Gorilla Nation Media also provides users with an explicit opportunity to opt-out every time an email promotion is sent.

In all instances, prior to providing PII information to GNM's Email or Promotions divisions, each online user is given meaningful notice regarding the collection practice and a choice regarding the dissemination of such information. All users are informed about how Gorilla Nation Media and its partners may use such information, including whether it will be shared with marketing partners or combined with other information available to GNM. Users will always be offered the choice not to provide PII or not to have such PII shared with others. Gorilla Nation Media will not share this PII information with any partner company if the user indicates on the registration form the preference to limit the use of such information.

Gorilla Nation Media does not collect personal medical information or credit information, or information related to children, except in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.

**How Gorilla Nation Media Uses Collected Information**  
Personally Identifiable Information (PII). PII is used by Gorilla Nation Media in several ways, as follows:

• GNM's Promotions and Email divisions use the PII to deliver permission-based direct marketing messages based on a user's expressed interests.  
• If an online user voluntarily submits its email address to GNM, or one of its partners, online, he or she may receive periodic emails from Gorilla Nation Media with information on new services or products being offered by our company or by one of our partners.

**Opting Out From GNM'S List of Permissioned Email Addresses**  
If you are a member of our database and do not wish to receive such mailings, send us an email to [legal@gorillanation.com](mailto:legal@gorillanation.com).

**With Whom Collected Information Is Shared**  
Gorilla Nation Media shares the collected information only as set forth below. Gorilla Nation Media does not sell or transfer the ownership of its PII or Non-PII. Gorilla Nation Media provides its partners only with access to such information on a limited basis. Before any access is shared with a partner, Gorilla Nation Media ensures that such partner publishes and adheres to strict privacy principles regarding the use of such information. Any such use is disclosed to the online user at the time such user submits information.

**Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** \- in cases where an online consumer has consented to have their information shared with third parties, Gorilla Nation Media will make access to the information available to selected third party partners in accordance with clearly stated guidelines.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII)** \- Access to Non-PII is shared, in aggregated format, with GNM's Web site and advertiser clients who use the aggregated data to determine the reach, effectiveness, future campaign plans, and success of their advertising campaigns. At no time is this non-PII merged with PII. It is useless to any and all parties except as quantifiable data to our advertisers and clients who wish to measure the effectiveness of their campaigns.

**Opting Out From GNM Promotions Database**  
An online user may request removal of his or her PII information from GNM's Promotions database by sending an email to [info@gorillanation.com](mailto:info@gorillanation.com).

Any consumer who prefers not to provide this information online, can send regular mail to the following address:  
Privacy @ GNM  
1524 F Cloverfield Blvd.  
Santa Monica, California 90404

Once a request to opt-out has been received by GNM, Gorilla Nation Media will deliver a confirming email message to the user that the user's PII has been successfully opted out of GNM's database. If you do not receive this confirmatory email, then please contact us to ensure that your request was received and processed. 

**Security and Access to Collected Information**  
Collection from reliable sources - Gorilla Nation Media collects information only from reliable third party partners that have strict and clearly stated privacy and data collection practices in place.

**Protection of collected data** \- Gorilla Nation Media maintains strict data security systems that ensure specific information will not be made available to any unauthorized person. All collected information is stored on our Web server or database but is not publicly accessible from our Web site. Gorilla Nation Media uses a password protected security system to control access to information stored about its users. Gorilla Nation Media also provides stringent physical security and only provides access to authorized personal.

**Dissemination restrictions** \- Gorilla Nation Media will provide access to collected PII data only to those partners that adhere to fair information practices for lawful, non-discriminatory purposes.
