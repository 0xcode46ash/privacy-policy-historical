Sneaker Freaker Pty Ltd (SNKRFRKR) is committed to protecting the privacy of our end users of SNKRFRKR’ content. SNKRFRKR endeavors to provide a safe and secure environment for end users. The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform you, as a SNKRFRKR user, what kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit www.sneakerfreaker.com, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the information. This privacy policy applies to any other Internet-accessible SNKRFRKR-branded services that incorporate this policy. Please note that this policy applies only to www.sneakerfreaker.com, and not to other companies’ or organizations’ Web sites to which we link.

## Information About All SNKRFRKR users and visitors.

In general, our site automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to Sneakerfreaker.com. We only use such data in the aggregate. This aggregate data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of the site, so we can improve our site to assure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible. For example, SNKRFRKR uses “cookies” that tells us how and when pages in our site are visited, and by how many people. These cookies do not collect personally identifiable information and we do not combine information collected through these cookies with other personally identifiable information to tell us who you are. We also may provide statistical information, never information about you personally, to our SNKRFRKR partners about how our members, collectively, use our internet sites. We do this so they too can understand how much people use their areas and our site in order for them to provide you with the best possible Web experience as well. Finally, Sneakerfreaker.com, its advertisers and ad servers may also use cookies, as well as “web beacons” or “clear gifs,” to determine on an anonymous basis which advertisements and promotions users have seen and how users responded to them, but do not use these technologies to collect personally identifiable information unless you give us permission to do so.
