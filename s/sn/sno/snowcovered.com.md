# Snowcovered, Inc.

Snowcovered, Inc. knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. **By visiting Snowcovered.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.**

**What Personal Information About Customers Does Snowcovered Gather?**

The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping and sales experience at Snowcovered.com. Here are the types of information we gather. 

  * **Information You Give Us:** We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you. We do NOT store credit card information of any type. 
  * **Automatic Information:** We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and to store your site password when you choose that option. 
  * **E-mail Communications:**  If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your send mail to [sales@snowcovered.com](mailto:sales@snowcovered.com). 



**Does Snowcovered Share the Information It Receives?**

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries Snowcovered, Inc. controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice. 

  * **Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:** We work closely with our affiliated businesses. We operate stores, provide services, or sell product lines jointly with these businesses. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share customer information related to those transactions with that third party. 
  * **Agents:** We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 
  * **Promotional Offers:** Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of Snowcovered customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please contact [sales@snowcovered.com](mailto:sales@snowcovered.com). 
  * **Business Transfers:** As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Snowcovered, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 
  * **Protection of Snowcovered, Inc. and Others:** We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Snowcovered, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice. 
  * **With Your Consent:** Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. 



**How Secure Is Information About Me?**

  * We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. 
  * It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. 



**Which Information Can I Access?**

Snowcovered gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with Snowcovered for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.

**Children**

Snowcovered does not sell products for purchase by children. If you are under 18, you may use Snowcovered.com only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. 

**Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions**

If you choose to visit Snowcovered.com, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the state of Tennessee. If you have any concern about privacy at Snowcovered, please send us a thorough description to [sales@snowcovered.com](mailto:sales@snowcovered.com) , and we will try to resolve it. 

Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.
