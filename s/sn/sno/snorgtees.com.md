#### **Anonymous Information**

#### **Cookies**

Like almost all e-commerce web sites, we use cookies. Our cookies don't store any of your personal information, but they do allow us to do things like keep items in your shopping cart during your visit or provide you with a more personalized user experience. We may use selected third parties for marketing and analysis purposes. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major web sites. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this anonymous information used by our third party service provider, please click [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). We feel that the use of 3rd party services such as this improve your online experience, because they allow you to see ads that will be more likely to be something you are interested in, rather than punch the monkey ads all day.

We use 128 bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt all of your private information when placing an order, which ensures that no one else can read this information.
