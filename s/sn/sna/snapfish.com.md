** What personally identifiable information does Snapfish.com collect? **   
To upload digital pictures or to view other's pictures on the Site, we will ask you to provide your first and last name, an email address and a password. If you want Snapfish.com to develop your film, you will also be asked for a billing address, a shipping address, and a credit card number for the payment of shipping and handling costs. You may also provide email addresses of your friends and family to start your personal Invitee list for use in sharing pictures at a later time. You also give information when you answer survey questions and organize your photos on Snapfish.com with titles, captions, categories, etc.   
You will be required to provide personally identifiable information such as shipping and billing addresses when you complete a purchase on Snapfish.com, if you have not provided such information in registration. Snapfish.com may occasionally run contests or other special promotions on our site in which we ask members or visitors for contact information (like an email address) or demographic information (like a zip code, age, or your camera brand). We may use the data we collect in these contests and promotions to send you promotional material about our company or our partners or sponsors. Your customer contact information collected from these contests and promotions may be used to contact you when necessary and may be shared with other companies for promotional purposes, but only with your prior permission and under the terms and conditions specified when you take part in the promotion. You may simply decline to take part in a contest or promotion if you do not wish to provide requested information. 

**How is the information used?**   
Snapfish.com's primary goal in collecting personal information from you is to provide you with a very personalized, relevant, user-friendly Web experience. Snapfish.com's main reason for collecting personally identifiable information is to personalize the Snapfish.com experience for you so that you receive your prints, see your pictures online, and receive relevant information, updates and promotional offers from Snapfish.com. 

For example, because we know who you are after you log in, we know to load the right set of albums into your Shoebox, which is your password-protected area on Snapfish.com. We also know where to email you to let you know your photos are ready for viewing online. Furthermore, if (for example) we know you are a new mom or dad, we know you may appreciate a promotional offer via email for discounted photo birth announcements from Snapfish.com or a coupon for discounts on baby clothes from a baby Web site. 

If you want to use the Snapfish.com Service for its free film developing and digitization service or for purchasing merchandise, we will ask for credit card information. In the case of free developing, we will automatically charge your credit card account for shipping and handling. For a merchandise purchase, we will ask for final confirmation before charging your credit card. We may collect information during the shopping experience to make purchasing an easier and better experience for you. For example, if you give us permission to keep your billing information, you won't have to fill out the shipping and billing address each and every time you purchase. 

In order to make the site more relevant to you we may also direct advertising from our sponsors according to the interests of our users. For instance, if we know you are a new mom or dad, we may show you an ad for diapers, while your brother, who likes sports, might see an ad for running shoes. Ultimately, this makes the service far more valuable to each individual. 

When you choose to share your online images with friends and family, those individuals will be able to view your name. 

As an integral part of the Snapfish.com service, we use your email and mailing address to inform you of site improvements, feature announcements, newsletters, Snapfish.com promotional offers, and third-party promotional offers. We also use your mailing address to send you your welcome kit, your prints and additional Snapfish.com mailers. 

We reserve the right to use aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group. For example, we might tell a prospective advertiser that 10,000 of our members have indicated an interest in golf, and then distribute an attractive offer exclusively to those users. 

**With whom does Snapfish.com share the information?**  
Snapfish.com will not sell, rent or otherwise share the personally identifiable information you provide us to a third party without your knowledge and consent. We will notify you at the time of data collection or transfer if your data will be shared with a third party. If you do not want your information shared with a third party, you will always have the option of not allowing the sharing or transfer of information. For those purposes, "Snapfish.com" means Snapfish.com Corporation and any successors to the assets or business of Snapfish.com Corporation. 

Advertisers on Snapfish.com do not have access to your individual account information. Advertisers simply give us an ad and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old, or 18-34 year olds interested in outdoor sports). Snapfish.com then displays the ad only to users who meet those criteria. 

Snapfish.com shares your information with third party intermediaries (for example, credit card authorization company, photo processing lab, merchandise distributors, etc.) who help us run the Snapfish.com service and site. These third party intermediaries do not store, retain or use the information you provide other than as necessary to provide you with the Snapfish.com service. 

Snapfish.com will disclose personally identifiable information as required by law or to protect the rights or property of Snapfish.com and its successors. 

**Who sees your photos online?**  
You, your Invitees and their Invitees can see your albums online. An Invitee is defined as anyone who is invited to the Snapfish site to see an album. Anyone who is invited to see an album online must provide an email address and a password to access the site and view a shared album. 

If you don't want your Invitees to invite other people to see the album, you can select the "No" option on the album invite. That will prohibit them from re-sharing the album from within their account on the Snapfish site. However, as with any email, your Invitees could forward the email invitation to others, who will then be able to click on the link to the album within the email, and see the pictures too. 

**Does Snapfish.com use "IP Addresses" and cookies?**   
_IP Addresses_ \-- An IP address is literally your computer's address and is a unique identifier, allowing online information to be sent to the right place. We use IP addresses to better understand the customer database. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information such as geographic distribution of our members. We do not intentionally link your IP address to your personally identifiable information. 

_Snapfish.com Cookies_ \-- Contrary to popular belief, cookies do not extract private or personal information from your computer's memory. The job of a cookie is to record only information you volunteer to us upon registering or visiting the site. Cookies are tiny files placed onto the hard drive of your computer the first time you visit our Web site that enable our server to recognize or "remember" who you are next time you come back. Currently, Snapfish.com intends to make only limited use of cookies for the purpose of delivering content and ads specific to your interests. For instance cookies may be used to retain your personal preferences, hold session information for a "shopping basket," or save your password so it doesn't have to be re-entered each time you log in. 

_Advertiser Cookies_ \-- Snapfish.com does post third party advertising banners. These ads may contain cookies used primarily to provide data to the advertiser about where visitors are coming from. While we do use cookies in other parts of our Web site as explained above, cookies received with banner ads may or may not be collected or controlled by our company. 

Snapfish.com works with two third party ad serving services, the Sonar Network and Engage Media, to help serve ads for this site. Snapfish.com does not control the privacy practices of these services. To find out more about how each of these third parties manages the privacy of information in conjunction with serving ads on this site, please review the [Sonar Network privacy policy](http://www.sonarnetwork.com/content/privacy.htm) and the [Engage Media privacy policy](http://www.engage.com/privacy). 

** What choices do I have regarding how the collected information is used? **  
Snapfish.com does not sell, rent or otherwise share your personally identifiable information without your knowledge and consent. You will be notified at the time of data collection or the time of transfer if your data will be shared or transferred and you will have the option of not permitting the sharing or transfer (usually through an "opt-out" check box). If the sharing or transfer of information is associated with a specific service, contest or promotion, you can choose not to use the service or not to participate in the promotion or contest. In other words, you are in control of whether you want your personally identifiable information shared or not. 

A condition of membership in Snapfish.com is active participation (see Terms and Conditions more information on active participation). As an integral part of Snapfish.com's free service (developing, digitization, viewing and sharing), Snapfish.com intends to send regular email updates and occasional promotional offers that may be of interest to you. Only Snapfish.com (or agents working on behalf of Snapfish.com under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings. If you do not wish to participate in this manner, you may always cancel your Snapfish.com membership by writing [cancel@snapfish.com](mailto:cancel@snapfish.com?subject=R02:%20Cancel%20my%20account).

As a part of Snapfish.com's goal to create a fun, safe and useful site for you to develop, print, digitize, store and post photos and comments, Snapfish.com may make available to you optional email newsletters with useful content about photography and other subjects in additional to our regular email updates. When we offer you optional emails, you may opt out of receiving them by checking an opt-out box. 

You also have a choice with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you can accept all cookies, be notified when a cookie is set or reject all cookies.

** What are the safeguards and security procedures in place to protect your information from loss, misuse, or alteration? **  
Your personal information on our Service is password-protected. We strongly recommend that you do not give your password to anyone and that you change it every 3 months. You may edit your Snapfish.com account information by using your Snapfish.com member name and password. 

If you are using a public computer (public library, school computer, etc.) or a shared computer (family computer, roommate's computer, etc.), we strongly recommend that you sign out of your Snapfish.com account and close your browser before getting up and moving away from the computer. This will prevent others from accessing your account and personal information. Please note that because our company is particularly sensitive to protecting information about children on the Internet, kids under 13 are not eligible to be members of Snapfish.com. However, we encourage parents to use our service as a family activity with their children and to carefully monitor any Internet activities (including use of the Snapfish.com services) engaged in by their kids. 

Snapfish.com employs SSL to encrypt and protect your personal information. We understand that this is especially important when there is an exchange of credit card, billing and password information. In addition, we limit access of personal information to only those employees who need it to carry out their jobs. 

Snapfish.com will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. You will only be asked for your member name and password when you initiate the contact and only if the member name and password are necessary to correct a service problem. 

** How can you update or correct personally identifiable information? **  
Personal information that you provide during registration is available in your Snapfish.com member profile. To edit your personal information, you must enter your member name and password in order to access your profile. You may edit your member profile at any time.
