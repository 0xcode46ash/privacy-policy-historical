** _What Customer Information does Snapfish collect?_ **   
Customer Information is requested whenever you choose to use Snapfish services. The type of Customer Information we request has to do specifically with the type of service you are using. For example: 

• _When you want to upload digital pictures or to view other's pictures on the Site,_ we will ask you to provide your first and last name, an email address and a password. 

• _When you want Snapfish to develop your film,_ we will also ask for a billing address, a shipping address, and a credit card number for the payment of developing and shipping and handling costs. 

• _When you want to share your pictures with others ( **"Invitees"** ),_ we will ask for email addresses of friends and family you choose to share with. 

• _When you complete a purchase from Snapfish,_ we will ask you to provide shipping and billing information so that we can fulfill your request (alternatively, you can provide such information in registration and we will not need to request it again). 

You also give information when you answer survey questions and organize your photos on Snapfish with titles, captions, categories, etc. 

Snapfish offers many optional promotional opportunities for which you may decide to submit Customer Information. For example, Snapfish may occasionally run contests or other special promotions on our site in which we ask members or visitors for contact information (like an email address) or demographic information (like a zip code, age, or your camera brand). We may use the data we collect in these contests and promotions to send you promotional material about our company or our partners or sponsors. Your customer contact information collected from these contests and promotions may be used to contact you when necessary and may be shared with other companies for promotional purposes, but only with your prior permission and under the terms and conditions specified when you take part in the promotion. **You are never required to take part in a contest or promotion — you may always simply decline if you do not wish to provide requested information.**

**_How is Customer Information used by Snapfish?_**   
Our primary goal in collecting your Customer Information is to provide you with a very personalized, relevant, user-friendly Web experience on the Snapfish site. Here are the ways that we use Customer Information to offer this experience: 

_Customer Communication_ : **We use Customer Information to communicate with you, and we consider this communication to be an integral part of the Snapfish service.** To keep this communication going, we use your email and mailing address to inform you of site improvements, feature announcements, newsletters, Snapfish promotional offers, and occasional third-party promotional offers that may be of interest to you. Only Snapfish (or agents working on behalf of Snapfish under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings. This is a key component of "active participation" in the Service (see our Terms and Conditions). If you do not wish to be an active participant, you may always cancel your Snapfish membership by writing [cancel@snapfish.com](mailto:cancel@snapfish.com?subject=R02:%20Cancel%20my%20account). 

_Customer Satisfaction_ : **We use Customer Information to make your Snapfish experience enjoyable.** For example, because we know who you are after you log in, we know to load the right set of albums into your Shoebox ( your password-protected area on Snapfish). We also know where to email you to let you know your photos are ready for viewing online. Furthermore, if (for example) we know you are a new mom or dad, we know you may appreciate a promotional offer via email for discounted photo birth announcements from Snapfish or a coupon for discounts on baby clothes from a baby Web site. 

_Customer Convenience_ : **We use Customer Information to provide you with the convenience of easy access to the services you request.** When you choose to use the Snapfish Service for its free film developing and digitization service or for purchasing merchandise, we will ask for credit card information and for your mailing address, so that we can send you your Snapfish Welcome Kit, your prints and negatives, and your Snapfish mailers. In the case of film developing, we will automatically charge your credit card account for any developing and shipping and handling fees. For a merchandise purchase, we will ask for final confirmation before charging your credit card. We may collect information during the shopping experience to make purchasing an easier and better experience for you. For example, if you give us permission to keep your billing information, you won't have to fill out the shipping and billing address each and every time you purchase. 

_Customer Offers_ : **We use Customer Information to offer you relevant information and promotions.** In order to make the site more relevant to you we may direct advertising from our sponsors according to the interests of our users. For instance, if we know you are a new mom or dad, we may show you an ad for diapers, while your brother, who likes sports, might see an ad for running shoes. Ultimately, this makes the service far more valuable to each individual. Also, as a part of Snapfish's goal to create a fun, safe and useful site, Snapfish may make available to you optional email newsletters with interesting content about photography and other subjects in additional to our regular email updates. When we offer you optional emails, you may always opt out of receiving them by checking an opt-out box. 

Note that one reason we are able to offer you relevant promotions is that we reserve the right to use aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group. For example, we might tell a prospective advertiser that 10,000 of our members have indicated an interest in golf, and then distribute an attractive offer exclusively to those users. Your Customer Information, however, will never be personally identifiable when aggregated for these purposes. 

**_With whom does Snapfish share Customer Information?_**  
Snapfish shares your Customer Information with third party intermediaries (for example, credit card authorization company, photo processing lab, merchandise distributors, etc.) who help us run the Snapfish service and site. Your Customer Information is provided to these third parties solely for the purpose of giving you the services you request at the time that you request them. Third party intermediaries do not store, retain, access or otherwise use your Customer Information other than as necessary to provide you with the Snapfish service. 

**Other than as described in the previous paragraph, Snapfish will not sell, rent or otherwise share Customer Information with a third party without your knowledge and consent prior to any data collection or transfer.** If you do not want your Customer Information shared at that time you will always have the option of telling us not to share it. For those purposes, "Snapfish" means Snapfish.com Corporation and any successors to the assets or business of Snapfish.com Corporation. 

Advertisers on Snapfish do not have access to your individual account information. Advertisers simply give us an ad and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old, or 18-34 year olds interested in outdoor sports). Snapfish then displays the ad only to users who meet those criteria. 

The one exception to the rule described in this section is the following: if Snapfish is required by law (or to protect its rights or property), we will disclose Customer Information to the extent so required. 

**_Who sees your photos after they have been posted online?_**  
You, your Invitees and their Invitees can see your albums online. An Invitee is defined as anyone who is invited to the Snapfish site to see an album. Anyone who is invited to see an album online must provide an email address and a password to access the site and view a shared album. When you choose to share your online images with Invitees, those individuals will be able to view your name. If you don't want your Invitees to invite other people to see the album, you can select the "No" option on the album invite. That will prohibit them from re-sharing the album from within their account on the Snapfish site. However, as with any email, your Invitees could forward the email invitation to others, who will then be able to click on the link to the album within the email, and see the pictures too. 

Snapfish employees or employees of partner companies that provide services to Snapfish may see your photos while they are developed, scanned or printed. In addition, your photos or personal account information may be seen by Snapfish employees in order to evaluate, validate, or correct problems with your account. 

**_Does Snapfish use "IP Addresses" and cookies?_**   
Snapfish uses IP Addresses and Cookies in limited ways, as follows: 

_IP Addresses_ : An IP address is literally your computer's address and is a unique identifier, allowing online information to be sent to the right place. We use IP addresses to better understand the customer database. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information such as the geographic distribution of our members. We do not intentionally link your IP address to your personally identifiable information. 

_Snapfish Cookies_ : Contrary to popular belief, cookies do not extract private or personal information from your computer's memory. The job of a cookie is to record only information you volunteer to us upon registering or visiting the site. Cookies are tiny files placed onto the hard drive of your computer the first time you visit our Web site that enable our server to recognize or "remember" who you are next time you come back. Currently, Snapfish intends to make only limited use of cookies for the purpose of delivering content and ads specific to your interests. For instance cookies may be used to retain your personal preferences, hold session information for a "shopping basket," or save your password so it doesn't have to be re-entered each time you log in. 

_Advertiser Cookies_ : Snapfish does post third party advertising banners. These ads may contain cookies used primarily to provide data to the advertiser about where visitors are coming from. While we do use cookies in other parts of our Web site as explained above, cookies received with banner ads may or may not be collected or controlled by our company. When you click on a banner ad, you should be aware that the advertiser may be collecting information without the permission of Snapfish. 

Snapfish works with a third party ad serving service, Doubleclick, to help serve ads for this site. Snapfish does not control the privacy practices of this service. To find out more about how this third party manages the privacy of information in conjunction with serving ads on this site, please review the Doubleclick privacy policy. 

_Advice on Limiting Cookies_ : You always have a choice with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you can accept all cookies, be notified when a cookie is set or reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies, you may be unable to use certain Snapfish services. Please consult your browser instructions for information on how to modify your choices about cookies. 

**_What are the safeguards and security procedures in place to protect your information from loss, misuse, or alteration?_**   
Your Customer Information on our Service is password-protected. We strongly recommend that you do not give your password to anyone and that you change it every 3 months. You may edit your Snapfish account information by using your Snapfish member name and password. 

If you are using a public computer (public library, school computer, etc.) or a shared computer (family computer, roommate's computer, etc.), we strongly recommend that you sign out of your Snapfish account and close your browser before getting up and moving away from the computer. This will prevent others from accessing your account and personal information. Please note that because our company is particularly sensitive to protecting information about children on the Internet, kids under 13 are not eligible to be members of Snapfish. However, we encourage parents to use our service as a family activity with their children and to carefully monitor any Internet activities (including use of the Snapfish services) engaged in by their kids. 

Snapfish employs SSL to encrypt and protect your Customer Information. We understand that this is especially important when there is an exchange of credit card, billing and password information. In addition, we limit access of Customer Information to only those employees who need it to carry out their jobs. 

**Snapfish will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email.** You will only be asked for your member name and password when you initiate the contact and only if the member name and password are necessary to correct a service problem. 

**_How can you update or correct Customer Information?_**   
Customer Information that you provide during registration is available in your Snapfish member profile. To edit your Customer Information, you must enter your member name and password in order to access your profile. You may edit your member profile at any time. 

You can also cancel your Snapfish membership by writing [cancel@snapfish.com](mailto:cancel@snapfish.com?subject=R02:%20Cancel%20my%20account). If you request cancellation of your account, Snapfish may (but is not required to) remove any and all content (photos) or other personal information from the Snapfish site, and your photos may not be accessible to you even if you choose to rejoin or reactivate your account at a later date. Information necessary for the purposes of maintaining business records regarding a cancelled account, including records of credit transactions and account ownership, will be retained in accordance with applicable law. 

**_Other information about privacy_**   
_Visitors outside the United States_ :  
For those of you visiting us from the European Economic Area, please note that if you access our Service, the information you enter will be transferred outside the European Economic Area. By participating in the Service, you consent to this transfer and to the information usage described above. Snapfish does not currently solicit or encourage usage by individuals outside of the United States. If you choose to access our Site from outside the United States, you take responsibility for compliance with applicable privacy laws of your country of residence. 

_Links from the Snapfish Site_ : If you click away from Snapfish to visit the site of any third party advertiser or sponsor, you may be asked for your credit card or other personal information in order to purchase or use products and services offered. These companies have their own privacy and data collection practices. As described above, Snapfish has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. You should therefore review their privacy policies carefully if you have concerns about how your information may be used. 

_Notification of Change_ : If Snapfish intends to expand the ways that Customer Information is used under this Privacy Policy, we will notify our members beforehand. 

_Contacting Snapfish_ : If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, you can contact us at [service@snapfish.com](mailto:service@snapfish.com?subject=R03:%20My%20questions).
