# Privacy Policy - Snappa

Snappa has created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to helping our users better understand what information we collect about them and what may happen to that information. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices. 

By accepting this Privacy Policy you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in the manner prescribed in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the [Terms and Conditions](https://snappa.io/terms). 

Subject to the requirements of applicable local law, we strive to provide a consistent set of privacy practices. 

####  Information We Collect 

#####  Non-Personally Identifiable Information 

We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on our website using cookies and other devices. We use this information for internal research on our members' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve you and our community. This information may include (but is not limited to) the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address. 

#####  Personally Identifiable Information 

Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs. 

Snappa only collects such personal information that is necessary for you to use our services. This personal information includes, but is not limited to, first and last name, mailing address, zip/postal code, email address, financial information, and other personal information necessary to satisfy legal requirements. 

As a matter of policy, we will never sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party. 

Your personally identifiable information will be stored and processed on our computers in the United States & Canada. The laws on holding personal data in the United States may differ from the Canadian laws but as we explain below, we will hold and transmit your information in a safe, confidential and secure environment. 

####  Our Use of Your Information 

Newsletters or other promotional emails may be sent to you from us. Users have the option to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time and at their sole discretion. 

####  Our Disclosure of Your Information 

Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting and foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government and law enforcement agencies. 

####  Security 

Snappa treats data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by members inside and outside the company. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the internet. 

####  Notice 

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time based on your comments and our need to accurately reflect our data collection and disclosure practices. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page, and/or update the Privacy Policy modification date below.
