When you use the internet, your web browser or software may communicate certain information to the host website you visit. This information may include the unique number assigned to your server or internet connection, the capabilities and features of your computer, you geographic location and your movement and activity within a particular website.

**DISCLOSURE**

Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, we will not sell, trade or disclose to third parties any personal information obtained by us through this website or from our partners about you without your consent. We may disclose personal information (i) to companies that help process the transactions you request in order to protect your transactions from fraud and verify your identity; (ii) that we in good faith believe is necessary or appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud, intellectual property infringements or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or you to legal liability; (iii) to conduct investigations of violations of the website Terms and Conditions; (iv) when required by law or to comply with a court order, subpoena, search warrant or other legal process; (v) to comply with legal, regulatory or administrative requirements of governmental authorities (including, without limitation, requests from the governmental agencies to view your personal information); (vi) to protect and defend us and any of our officers, directors, employees, attorneys, agents, contractors and partners in connection with any legal action, claim or dispute; (vii) to prevent imminent physical harm; (viii) to provide data, including personal information about you, to our partners as well as other business partners with whom we deem it necessary to communicate in order to provide our services (e.g., Authorize.Net); (ix) to sell or otherwise provide the information to third parties in the event of a bankruptcy or liquidation; and (x) to sell or otherwise provide information to third parties in the event of a future merger or acquisition by another company. In the event we merge or are acquired by another company, the successor company will have access to your personal information in order to continue to provide services but would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended as described herein.

**HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION**

We offer secure web pages to collect certain kinds of user information and we store certain kinds of data in encrypted form. We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our system. Although no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented on our website reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.

**HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION**

We generally keep user data on our server or in our archives for as long as we reasonably need it. We may alter this practice according to changing requirements. For example, we may delete some data if needed to free up storage space. We may keep other data for longer periods if the law requires it. In addition, information posted in a public forum could stay in the public domain indefinitely. Data management requests are administered in an orderly manner to the extent feasible and within our direct control. Please note that we have greater control over recently collected data than over archived data. Once data is removed from the system and archived, it may not be feasible to accommodate specific requests. In those cases, our general data retention policy applies.
