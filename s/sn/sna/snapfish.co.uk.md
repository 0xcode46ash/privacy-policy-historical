**INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE**

**Information Collection**  
Along with Snapfish, Jessops is the joint owner of information collected on www.jessops.com and via Jessopsphotos.com. Jessops collects information from our users at several different points on our website. 

**Order**  
We request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and delivery address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiry date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfil customers' orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user. Snapfish handle the payment processing on our behalf. 

**Information Use**  
We use the following information in order to process your order from our e-commerce site: full name including title, address, telephone or fax numbers, and email address. More details of this can be found in our third party section, below. 

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. 

**We have no third-party cookies on our website, nor do we share the information recorded in them with anyone other than Snapfish as required to fulfil your order.**

**Third Party Advertising**  
We do not have ANY third party advertising on our site. 

**Log Files**  
Like most standard website servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. We use a tracking utility called Webtrends that uses log files to analyze user movement. 

**COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SITE**

**Service Announcements**  
On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature. 

**Customer Service**  
We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account. We reply via email or phone, in accordance with the users wishes. 

**SHARING**

**Legal Disclaimer**  
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website. 

**Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)**  
We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. For example, we may pass details to our suppliers of the number of users looking at/purchasing their products, or the number of click-throughs from their own sites. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information. 

**We DO NOT Share Personal Information with Third Parties, except for the purposes of Credit/Debit card authorisation, and Delivery.**

**Third Party Intermediaries**  
For the purpose of credit/debit card authorisation we will pass your name and address to our Bank. For the purpose of delivering your parcel we will pass your name and address to Parcelforce or another of our parcel carriers. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

**Service Providers**  
We partner with a third party company "Snapfish", to provide the "Jessops Photos" Internet Printing Service. When the user signs up for these particular services, we share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. If the customer places an order using the "Jessops Photos" service then payment will be taken by Snapfish. Snapfish are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing the " Jessops Photos" service. 

**Business Transitions**  
In the event Jessops goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via a prominent notice on our Website for 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section. 

**Choice/Opt-out**  
Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for information. For example, our order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who buy a product from us but don't want any marketing material can keep their email address off of our lists. 

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at [webmaster@jessops.com](mailto:webmaster@jessops.com) \- PLEASE STATE CLEARLY THAT YOUR REQUEST RELATES TO THE JESSOPS PHOTOS SERVICE. 

Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties, other than Jessops or Snapfish. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party. 

**Links**  
This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Jessops, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website. 

**Surveys & Contests**  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as postcode). Contact information will be used and may be shared with the contest/survey sponsors to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Users' personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and choice. 

**Security**  
This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, their information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. This uses 128 bit encryption, the highest currently commercially available. 

While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our Web Sales or Dispatch teams) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a locked facility. 

If users have any questions about the security at our website, users can send an email to [webmaster@jessops.com](mailto:webmaster@jessops.com). 

**Supplementation of Information**  
In order for this website to properly fulfil its obligation to users it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources. 

**Address Verification**  
We use AFD software to verify a user's address to gain authorisation for sales charged to their credit/debit card. 

**Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information**  
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as postcode, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can be done by emailing our Customer Support at webmaster@jessops.com. Or, contact us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed at the bottom of this page. 

**Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our website notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
