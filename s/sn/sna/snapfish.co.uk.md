# PrivacyStatement

## Snapfish respects your privacy

Snapfish2, LLC whose registered office is at 10501 Rhode Island Avenue, Beltsville, MD 20705 ("Snapfish") and its subsidiaries respect your privacy. This Privacy Statement informs you of our privacy practices and of the choices you can make about the way information about you, including from your online activity is collected and how that information is used by Snapfish. This statement is readily available on our home page and at the bottom of every Snapfish web page. 

By visiting our website or using any of our services, you agree to your personal information being used and disclosed in the manner set out in this Policy.

How Snapfish uses automatic data collection tools:

  


## 1\. Links to non-Snapfish website

Snapfish sites or services may provide links to third-party applications, products, services, or websites for your convenience and information. If you access those links, you will leave the Snapfish site. Snapfish does not control those third party sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from Snapfish's practices. We do not endorse or make any representations about third-party sites. The personal data you choose to provide to or that is collected by these third parties is not covered by the Snapfish Privacy Statement. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any site you interact with before allowing the collection and use of your personal information.

We may also provide social media features that enable you to share information with your social networks and to interact with Snapfish on various social media sites. Your use of these features may result in the collection or sharing of information about you, depending on the feature. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and settings on the social media sites with which you interact to make sure you understand the information that may be collected, used, and shared by those sites.

  


## 2\. Collection of personal information

Snapfish collects, exports, and uses personal information to manage your relationship with Snapfish and better serve you by personalizing your experience and interaction with Snapfish. Such collection is done with appropriate notice and consent, along with required filings with data protection authorities, where required.

Snapfish may collect your personal information through your access and use of website, web-based applications, or mobile applications, during conversations or correspondence with Snapfish representatives, or when you purchase goods or services or complete an online application form.

Snapfish may collect personal information from you in connection with

  


  * product or service orders, activations, and registrations
  * profile creation and user verification for online services
  * information requests or complaints
  * marketing, newsletter or support subscriptions
  * contest entries or survey participation
  * instant credit applications
  * job applications
  * event registration
  * visits or browsing on Snapfish websites



The types of personal information Snapfish may collect from you includes:

  


  * personal and business contact information, such as name, address, telephone number, and email address
  * in some cases, your business contact data may be provided to Snapfish by a designated entity within your business or enterprise (such as a member of your IT department)
  * financial information, such as your credit/debit card number or other billing information
  * other unique information such as user IDs and passwords, product functionality, product and service preferences, contact preferences, educational and employment background, and job interest data
  * geo-location data such as your IP address or physical location when you request location based services
  * details of the products and services you have purchased from us or which you have enquired about, together with any additional information necessary to deliver those products and services and to respond to your enquiries
  * any additional information relating to you that you provide to us directly through our websites or indirectly through use of our websites or online presence, through our representatives or otherwise
  * information you provide to us through our service center, customer surveys or visits by our representatives from time to time



If you apply for instant credit, we may ask you to provide additional personal information such as salary, government issued identification number, banking/financial account information, and other information (for example from credit reporting agencies) to authenticate you and verify credit worthiness. This information will be used by our financial services providers in determining whether to extend you credit and how much to extend.

If you choose to use a "tell-a-friend" or a similar referral program on our site, we will ask you for your friend's e-mail address, social media handle, phone number, or other contact information to send your friend an invitation to participate in the program.

If you post, comment, indicate interest or complaint, or share personal information, including photographs, to any public forum on a Snapfish site, social network, blog, or other such forum, please be aware that any information you submit can be read, viewed, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to contact you, send you unsolicited messages, or for purposes that neither you nor Snapfish have control over. Snapfish is not responsible for the personal information you choose to provide in these forums.

In addition to the information you provide, Snapfish may also collect information during your visit to a Snapfish website, web-based application, or a website "powered by" another company on behalf of Snapfish, through our Automatic Data Collection Tools, which include Web beacons, cookies, and embedded Web links. These tools collect certain traffic information that your browser sends to a website, such as your browser type and language, access times, and the address of the website from which you arrived. They may also collect information about your Internet Protocol (IP) address, unique device identifier, clickstream behavior (i.e., the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with Snapfish websites or "powered by" websites) and product information. Snapfish may also use some of these Automatic Data Collection Tools in connection with certain emails and communications sent from Snapfish and therefore may collect information using these tools when you open the email or click on a link contained in the email. To learn more, read How Snapfish uses automatic data collection tools.

Snapfish also collects information from publicly or commercially available sources that it deems credible. Such information may include your name, address, email address, preferences, interests, and demographic/profile data. The information Snapfish collects from its public or commercial sources may be used along with the information Snapfish collects when you visit Snapfish's sites. For example, Snapfish may compare the geographic information acquired from commercial sources with the IP address collected by Automatic Data Collection Tools to derive your general geographic area.

Snapfish may also collect some information that is not personal information because it does not identify you or anyone else. For example, we may collect anonymous answers to surveys or aggregated information about how users use our websites, products or services.

  


## 3\. How we use your information

Snapfish may use your information to

  


  * manage our relationship with you
  * assist you in completing a transaction or order
  * prevent and detect security threats, fraud or other malicious activity
  * communicate with you about Snapfish products, services or support and send marketing communications

We will give you the opportunity to choose your privacy preferences regarding the marketing communications we send (see Your choices and selecting your privacy preferences).

Credit card information is used only for payment processing and fraud prevention. Salary information, government issued identification number and other sensitive personal information is not used for any other purpose by our financial services providers or Snapfish and will not be kept longer than necessary for providing the services, unless you ask us to retain your credit card information for future purchases.

  


## 4\. How we share your information

Snapfish will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others except as described in this Statement. Snapfish shares personal information in the following ways:

Snapfish retains service providers and suppliers to manage or support its business operations, provide professional services, deliver complete products, services and customer solutions and to assist Snapfish with marketing and communication initiatives. These providers and suppliers may be located in the US or other overseas locations and include, for example, credit card processors, debt collectors, providers of customer support and live-help, marketing and communications, hosting and IT service providers, email service providers, automated data processors, shipping agents, management and support of Snapfish websites, order fulfilment and delivery. Suppliers and service providers are required by contract to keep confidential and secure the information received on behalf of Snapfish and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Snapfish.

From time to time, Snapfish participates in marketing initiatives with other companies, including websites "powered by" another company on behalf of Snapfish. As part of these initiatives, certain Snapfish services and marketing communications may be delivered at the same time as those from other companies. Some of these services and communications offer you the option to share personal information with both Snapfish and the other companies participating in these initiatives. For example, you may receive marketing communications from Snapfish and other companies or have the opportunity to register online for software products from multiple companies. If you choose to provide personal information only to Snapfish, Snapfish will not share this information with the other companies participating in that marketing initiative. If you choose to provide personal information to the other companies, that personal information will be handled according to the privacy policy of those companies, which may differ from Snapfish's policies and practices.

Snapfish may also transfer your personal information to other entities in Snapfish's corporate group in the US and Worldwide. By accessing Snapfish websites, registering for an account or service, or otherwise providing Snapfish with your personal information, you consent to this transfer of your personal information throughout Snapfish's international group of companies.

Except as described in this Statement, Snapfish will not share the personal information you provide to Snapfish with non-Snapfish third parties without your permission, unless to: (i) respond to duly authorized information requests of police and governmental authorities; (ii) comply with any law, regulation, subpoena, or court order; (iii) investigate and help prevent security threats, fraud or other malicious activity; (iv) enforce/protect the rights and properties of Snapfish or its subsidiaries; or (v) protect the rights or personal safety of Snapfish, our employees, and third parties on or using Snapfish property when allowed and in line with the requirements of applicable law.

Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, Snapfish decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is Snapfish's practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.

  


## 5\. Where we store your personal data

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or one of our suppliers.

## 6\. Children's privacy

Snapfish does not knowingly collect information from children as defined by local law, and does not target its websites or mobile applications to children under these ages. We encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online and mobile activities and interests.

## 10\. Access to and accuracy of your information

Snapfish strives to keep your personal information accurately recorded. We have implemented technology, management processes and policies to help maintain data accuracy. Snapfish provides individuals with reasonable access to personal information that they provided to Snapfish and the reasonable ability to review and correct it or ask for anonymization, blockage, or deletion, as applicable. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as requiring a password and user ID, before granting access to your data. To view and change the personal information that you directly provided to Snapfish you can return to the web page where you originally submitted your data and follow the instructions on that web page, or contact the Snapfish Privacy Office. Snapfish will respond to access requests within 30 days.

  


## 11\. Keeping your personal information secure

Snapfish takes seriously the trust you place in us. To seek to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the information, Snapfish utilizes reasonable and appropriate physical, technical, and administrative procedures to safeguard the information we collect and process. Snapfish retains data only as required or permitted by local law and while it has a legitimate business purpose. Where your information is no longer required, we will ensure it is disposed of in a secure manner.

When collecting or transferring sensitive information such as credit card information we use a variety of additional security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. The personal information you provide us is stored on computer systems located in controlled facilities which have limited access. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as credit card number or password) over the internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

Credit card numbers are used only for processing payments and are not used for other purposes. As part of real-time payment processing, Snapfish subscribes to fraud management services. This service provides Snapfish with an extra level of security to guard against credit card fraud and to protect your financial data.

If we make significant changes to our Statement that materially alter our privacy practices, we may also notify you by other means, such as sending an email or posting a notice on our corporate website and/or social media pages prior to the changes taking effect.

## 14\. How Snapfish uses automatic data collection tools

The following sections provide additional information about commonly-used web technology tools.

  


## 15\. Cookies

A "cookie" is a small data file transferred by a website to your computer's hard drive. Snapfish or its service providers send cookies when you surf our site or sites where our ads appear, make purchases, request or personalize information, or register yourself for certain services. Accepting the cookies used on our site, sites that are "powered by" another company on Snapfish's behalf, or sites where our ads appear may give us access to information about your browsing behavior, which we may use to personalize your experience. Cookies are typically classified as either "session" cookies or "persistent" cookies.

  


  * Session cookies do not stay on your computer after you close your browser.
  * Persistent cookies remain on your computer until you delete them or they expire. Most browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but you can usually refuse cookies or selectively accept cookies by adjusting the preferences in your browser. If you turn off cookies, there may be some features of our site that will not be available to you and some Web pages may not display properly.



In certain countries you may also adjust your Snapfish.co.uk and associated cookie preferences by using a preference manager tool in this Statement which is available from the site you are visiting.

You can find information on popular browsers and how to adjust your cookie preferences in the help and support section of your browser.

From time to time, Snapfish will use Flash local shared objects (LSOs) to store Flash content information and preferences. LSOs perform similar functions to HTML browser cookies and deposit small files on your computer, which are commonly called Flash cookies. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies and cookie management tools provided by your browser may not remove Flash cookies. To learn more about Flash Cookies and how to manage the related privacy and storage settings, please visit the [Adobe Systems website ](http://www.adobe.com/).

  


## 16\. Web beacons

Some Snapfish and third-party web pages, applications, and HTML-formatted email use Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about your website usage and your interaction with email, as well as to measure performance on Snapfish, applications, and websites "powered by" another company on Snapfish's behalf. A web beacon is an electronic image, called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date of a page viewed, and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. Depending on the context, web beacons may also refer to content on a third-party server, and may be used by service providers to deliver relevant advertising to you.

You may be able to disable web beacons in email messages by not downloading images contained in the message you receive (this feature varies depending on the email software used on your personal computer). However, doing this may not always disable a web beacon or other automatic data collection tools in the email message due to specific email software capabilities. For more information about this, please refer to the information provided by your email software or service provider.

If you choose to receive marketing emails or newsletters from Snapfish as specified in Your choices and selecting your privacy preferences, Snapfish may automatically collect personal information about you. For example, through web beacons and personalized URLs embedded in these emails or newsletters, Snapfish can track whether you've opened those messages and whether you've clicked on links contained within those messages. For more information on embedded web links, see below.

  


## 17\. Embedded Web links

Emails from Snapfish, Internet keyboard keys preconfigured by Snapfish, and promotional icons preinstalled on your PC desktop often use links designed to lead you to a relevant area on the Web, after redirection through Snapfish's servers. The redirection system allows Snapfish to change the destination URL of these links, if necessary, and to determine the effectiveness of our marketing initiatives.

In emails, such web links may also allow Snapfish to determine whether you have clicked a link in an email, and this information about the interaction may be connected to your personal identity. If you do not want Snapfish to collect information about the links that you click, you can:

  


  * change your choice about how you receive communications from Snapfish (i.e. choose a text-based version of the message where available) or choose not to click links in an email that Snapfish sends
  * delete the promotional icons preinstalled by Snapfish on your PC desktop or choose not to click on those
  * reconfigure the Internet keyboard keys on certain PC models to launch a destination URL of your choice by using the instructions provided with your PC



## 18\. Snapfish ads and offerings on third-party websites

Snapfish contracts with service providers to place ads on websites owned by third parties. In addition, some websites may be "powered by" a service provider to provide Snapfish offers on Snapfish's behalf. These service providers may send cookies from and use web beacons on these third-party websites and on our websites. The cookies and web beacons may enable Snapfish to collect information about the pages you viewed and the links you clicked.

Most web browsers offer you the ability to inform websites and ad networks that you do not want your online activities tracked through a "Do Not Track" feature.

You can learn more about network advertising and how to opt out by visiting [http://www.aboutads.info ](http://www.aboutads.info/).
