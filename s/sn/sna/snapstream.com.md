# SnapStream: Privacy Policy

Updated February 28, 2007

Thank you for visiting the home of SnapStream Media, Inc. (“SnapStream”).

**1.0 Overarching Commitment**

SnapStream is committed to protecting the privacy of our users’ personal information. The SnapStream Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”), set forth below, provides a detailed description of what information SnapStream currently collects, how SnapStream protects said information, and means for SnapStream users to contact SnapStream concerning collection of their personal information and the Privacy Policy. 

The Privacy Policy covers information collected when using any SnapStream website (“Site”), including but not limited to the SnapStream store (“Store”), Couchville.com ("Couchville"), SnapStream.Net (“.Net”), the SnapStream Forums (“Forums”); SnapStream Beyond TV (“Beyond TV”); SnapStream Beyond Media (“Beyond Media”); SnapStream Firefly PC Remote (“Firefly”); and SnapStream Firefly Mini PC Remote (“Firefly Mini”). The Privacy Policy will be updated when necessary; so, please check here (http://www.snapstream.com/privacy.asp) for future updates or contact SnapStream directly for a copy through the means set forth below in Section 7.0.   


**2.0 Categories of Information**

2.1 “Personally Identifiable Information” means any information that identifies or can be used to identify or contact the user to whom such information pertains. This includes information that is not Personally Identifiable Information but is used in a way that makes the information personally identifiable. Such uses include linking the information with Personally Identifiable Information from other sources, including, but not limited to, name, address, phone number, email address, and credit card information. To the extent unique information (which by itself is not Personally Identifiable Information) such as a personal profile, a unique identifier, or an IP address is associated with Personally Identifiable Information, then such unique information will also be considered Personally Identifiable Information. Personally Identifiable Information does not include information that is collected anonymously (i.e., without identification of the individual user), or demographic information not connected to an identified individual.

2.2 “Non-Personally Identifiable Information” means any information SnapStream collects that cannot be directly linked to an individual user.

**3.0 Information Gathered**

3.1 SnapStream Site: When a user visits our Site, certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information is recorded. SnapStream automatically documents what pages the user visits and for how long, from where the user linked, the user’s IP address, and other technical statistics, none of which is used to personally identify the user. SnapStream collects the data to learn from where Site visitors come, what Site features users use most, and other similar development- and maintenance-related information so that SnapStream can improve service for our users. SnapStream urges the user to read the Google/Urchin Privacy Policy as well, located at <http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy.html>. 

3.2 SnapStream Store: When a user orders products from the Store, certain Personally Identifiable Information is recorded, including, but not limited to, name, address, phone number, email address, and credit card information. Certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information is also recorded, including, but not limited to IP address, items ordered, and the referring URL. The Store is currently powered by Yahoo!. SnapStream urges the user to read the Yahoo! Privacy Policy as well, located at http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/us/.

3.3 Couchville: When a user visits Couchville, certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information is recorded. SnapStream automatically documents what pages the user visits and for how long, from where the user linked, the user’s IP address, and other technical statistics, none of which is used to personally identify the user. SnapStream collects the data to learn from where Couchville visitors come, what Couchville features users use most, and other similar development- and maintenance-related information so that SnapStream can improve service for our users. 

Additionally, when a user creates a personalized line-up in Couchville, Couchville will place a cookie file on the user’s hard drive. Said cookie does not contain any personally identifiable information but does record the zip code and tv service provider provided by the user. Upon the user’s next visit to Couchville, the cookie will be called up, providing a faster, user-specific interface. Cookies can be blocked or removed through your browser features; however, blocking or removing cookies will deny the user customized content delivery.

3.4 SnapStream Beyond TV: When a user uses Beyond TV, certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information is recorded, including but not limited to, whether the user is upgrading from a previous version. Additionally, users are given the option to enable certain advanced features. Should the user choose to enable the advanced features, certain Personally Identifiable Information may be gathered by SnapStream, including, but not limited to user viewing preferences and recording choices and preferences.
