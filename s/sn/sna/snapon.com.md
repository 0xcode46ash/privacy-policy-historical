# Privacy Practices Statement

**Privacy Practices Statement**

**Snap-on Incorporated Online Privacy Policy**

**Our Commitment to Privacy**

The privacy of your personally-identifiable information is important to us. As part of our commitment to the privacy of your personally-identifiable information, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally-identifiable information may be requested. 

The privacy practices set forth in this Privacy Policy are for this Site only.  Other Snap-on affiliate web sites may have different practices.  If you link to or otherwise visit these or any other websites, please review the privacy policies posted at those sites.

**The Information We Collect**

In general, when you visit our Site you remain anonymous, but on some pages, you need to provide personally-identifiable information to register, order products and contact Snap-on Incorporated ("Snap-on"). The types of personally-identifiable information collected at these pages may include: 

Name, Company , Snap-on Customer Number (if applicable), Address, City, State, Zip Code, Country, Email Address, Phone Number, Fax Number, Credit/Debit Card/Procurement Card Information 

**The Way We Use Information**

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order to complete that order or to provide a more personalized shopping experience. We do not and will not share this information with third parties other than Snap-on's affiliates and employees except to the extent necessary to complete that order. In addition, we may share certain information about you and any purchases you make with independent Snap-on dealers in your area.  We maintain credit/debit card/procurement card information only until payment for your order is processed unless you authorize the information to be stored for future visits. If you later decide that you do not want us to store such information, you may contact us at [eorders@snapon.com](mailto:eorders@snapon.com) and ask us to delete such information. 

We use information about your purchases to make recommendations for additional products or special offers you might be interested in unless you tell us you do not want to receive such information, in which case you can contact us at [eorders@snapon.com](mailto:eorders@snapon.com) and ask us to stop sending you such information. 

We also use return email addresses and customer addresses which you provide to us when placing an order or accessing this website to answer the email and correspondence we receive, confirm your order, send renewal notices, notify you of important changes in the functionality of the Web site, update you on new products, and communicate special offers we think you might be interested in. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with third parties other than Snap-on's affiliates and independent Dealers. If you do not want to receive this information in the future, please contact us at [eorders@snapon.com](mailto:eorders@snapon.com).

 We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our Web site and gather information for product management and development at Snap-on. For example, we may tell our sales and marketing staff that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our Web site, or that Y number of software licenses were ordered during a particular time period, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. This information may also be shared with Snap-on's affiliates and independent dealers. 

Finally, we will not use or share the personally-identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

**Our Commitment to Data Security**

We have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. When you place orders or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software receives encrypted information through the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) of your internet browser which encrypts the information you input before it is sent to us and prevents anyone else from reading it as the information travels from your computer to ours.  If you are still concerned about placing an order online, call a customer service representative at 1-877-762-7664 and place your order via phone.

**Cookies**

Snap-on uses cookies on this website for the purpose of storing and maintaining passwords, and to provide you with an updated, more personalized visit each time you visit our website, for instance, by making you aware of what’s new on our website since your last visit.. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. 

**Our Commitment to Children's Privacy**

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our Web site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our Web site is structured to attract anyone under 13. Any parent or guardian that learns that their child may have submitted personally-identifiable information should contact us immediately at [eorders@snapon.com](mailto:questions@snapon.com).

**How You Can Access or Correct Your Information**

You can access and correct all your personally-identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by clicking on "Your Account" and entering your user id and password. You are solely responsible for the maintenance and security of your user id and password. For other questions related to updating or changing your account information, please send an e-mail to [eorders@snapon.com](mailto:eorders@snapon.com). If any errors in your personally identifiable information cannot be corrected by accessing "Your Account", please contact us using the contact information below.  You may also contact us using the information below to ask us to remove your personally identifiable information from our records, electronic or otherwise.  However, we will need to maintain certain information about your product purchases in our records for purposes such as warranty and product information.
