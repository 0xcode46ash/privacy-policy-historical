# Privacy Practices Statement

**Privacy Practices Statement**

 **Snap-on Incorporated Online Privacy Policy**

 **Our Commitment to Privacy**

The privacy of your personally identifiable information is important to us. As part of our commitment to the privacy of your personally identifiable information, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this site. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information is requested. 

The privacy practices set forth in this Privacy Policy are for this site only. Other Snap-on affiliate Web sites may have different practices (see appendix of sites below). If you link to or otherwise visit these or any other Web sites, please review the privacy policies posted at those sites. 

**The Information We Collect**

In general, when you visit our site you remain anonymous, but on some pages, you need to provide personally identifiable information to register, order products and contact Snap-on Incorporated ("Snap-on"). The types of personally identifiable information collected at these pages may include: 

Name, Company, Snap-on Customer Number (if applicable), Address, E-mail Address, Phone Number, Fax Number, and Credit/Debit Card/Procurement Card Information 

We also enable you to submit information about other people. For example, we request that you provide us with information about your dealer or representative or, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name and address. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: dealer or representative’s name and contact information, and a gift recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number. 

**The Way We Use Information**

We use the information you provide when placing an order or accessing this Web site to complete that order and to provide a more personalized shopping experience. 

We maintain credit/debit card/procurement card information only until payment for your order is processed unless you authorize the information to be stored for future visits. If you later decide that you do not want us to store such information, you may contact us at [eorders@snapon.com](mailto:eorders@snapon.com) and ask us to delete such information. 

We also use your information to communicate with you, for example, to answer the e-mail and correspondence we receive, to confirm your order, to send more information about becoming a dealer, to send renewal notices, and to notify you of important changes in the functionality of the Web site. 

We may use your information to make recommendations for additional products or special offers, and to provide you with updates on new products that we believe may be of interest to you. If you do not want to receive this information in the future, please contact us at [eorders@snapon.com](mailto:eorders@snapon.com).

From time to time, we may share certain information with select third parties including other Snap-on affiliates and independent Snap-on dealers in your area to enable them to offer products or services that may be of interest to you. If you do not want us to share your information, please contact us at [eorders@snapon.com](mailto:eorders@snapon.com).

We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena or a law enforcement agency’s request.

We will not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

**Customization and Aggregate data**

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our Web site and gather information for product management and development at Snap-on. For example, we may tell our sales and marketing staff that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our Web site, or that Y number of software licenses were ordered during a particular time period, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. This aggregate information may also be shared with Snap-on's affiliates and independent dealers. 

**Our Commitment to Data Security**

We have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. When you place orders or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software receives encrypted information through the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) of your internet browser which encrypts the information you input before it is sent to us and prevents anyone else from reading it as the information travels from your computer to ours. If you are still concerned about placing an order online, call a customer service representative at 1-877-762-7664 and place your order via phone.

 **Cookies**

Snap-on uses cookies on this Web site for the purpose of maintaining a shoppers id allowing us to keep track of items in your shopping cart. We also use cookies that are for identifying who you are after logging in or registering. These cookies can also be used for creating a more personalized visit each time you visit our Web site, for instance, by making you aware of what’s new on our Web site since your last visit. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive.

 **Children's Privacy**

Snap-on has no intention of collecting personal information from children at this site. 

**How You Can Access or Correct Your Information**

You can access and correct the personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by clicking on "Your Account" and entering your user id and password. You are solely responsible for the maintenance and security of your user id and password. For other questions related to updating or changing your account information, please send an e-mail to [eorders@snapon.com](mailto:eorders@snapon.com). If any errors in your personally identifiable information cannot be corrected by accessing "Your Account", please contact us using the contact information below. You may also contact us using the information below to ask us to remove your personally identifiable information from our records, electronic or otherwise. However, we will need to maintain certain information about your product purchases in our records for purposes such as warranty and product information. 

**Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites**

Sometimes we may offer promotions or specials that are sponsored by or co-sponsored with identified third parties. By virtue of their sponsorship, these third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that you submit to participate in the promotion or special. Snap-on has no control over the third-party sponsors' use of this information. We will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if third-party sponsors will obtain such information.

 **Changes to the Policy**

Our privacy practices, like the online medium itself, are subject to change. If we make any substantial changes, we will notify you by posting a prominent announcement at our site. 

**How to Contact Us**

Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies or wish to have your personally identifiable information deleted from our records, please send an email to [eorders@snapon.com](mailto:eorders@snapon.com) or mail correspondence to Snap-on Incorporated, 2801 80th Street, Kenosha, WI 53141.
