# Snapfinger Privacy Policy

Protecting the privacy of our customers and clients is of great importance to us at Snapfinger, Inc. ("Snapfinger"). This Privacy Policy explains the type of personal information we collect, and how we use, protect and disclose that information.

We are strongly committed to preserving online privacy for all of our web site visitors, including children. Our website is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect information about children or sell products to children. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we will not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, you must ask your parent or guardian to assist you in using our website.

  1. Collection of Personal Information.

Restaurants use our web-based remote ordering services to allow you to place orders through the internet, mobile devices, call centers, and other "remote" methods. As a result of those orders, Snapfinger receives and collects certain personal information about our customers, which may include name, address, zipcode, phone number, credit card numbers, email address, and order history.

  2. Location Data.

In some instances, our website may include various location-based features, such as determining your state and country origin. To provide these location-based features, Snapfinger and the restaurants may collect, use and share your location data, including the real-time geographic location of your mobile device.

  3. Use and Disclosure of Personal Information.

Snapfinger will not disclose your personal information to any person or entity except (i) Snapfinger will send your personal and other order information to the restaurants you order from using our system, (ii) Snapfinger may provide personal information to our vendors and suppliers when necessary, (iii) Snapfinger may share certain personal information with our affiliates in order to complete transactions, (iv) Snapfinger may transfer personal information to any successor in connection with a sale of all or substantially all of our business or assets (whether by way of stock sale, asset sale, merger, business combination, reorganization or otherwise), (v) Snapfinger may disclose your personal information if it is necessary in order to provide products or services to you, including purchaser verification, authentication, geolocation and authorization for any orders (and contacting you when necessary), and (vi) Snapfinger may release personal information to comply with law, enforce or apply the terms of any user agreement, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Snapfinger, customers and clients, or others. Restaurants may use your personal information to contact you concerning products, services and promotions which may be of interest to you. Upon receiving your permission, we may share your personal information with such third parties to advise you of products, services and promotions. The use of your personal information provided to such third parties is governed by their privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our clients or for their collection or use of your personal information. We encourage you to read the privacy policies and statements of those restaurants which are posted on the site from where you placed your order. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Snapfinger. Therefore, we disclaim any liability for any third party's use of your personal information in a manner in conflict with this or their own privacy policy.

If you are a California resident, you may ask us to refrain from sharing your information (whether collected online or offline) with third parties for their marketing purposes. Please tell us your preference by contacting us at [support@snapfinger.com](mailto:support@snapfinger.com).

The security of your personal information is very important to us. We use industry-standard technical safeguards and an employee code of conduct and training to help ensure the integrity and privacy of your personal information. Only authorized Snapfinger employees, agents and independent contractors are permitted to access your personal information, and all such employees, agents and independent contractors must agree to maintain the privacy and confidentiality of your personal information in accordance with our policies.
