SnapApp requires that account holders be eighteen (18) years of age or older. 

Payment Information: Credit Card and direct debit payments for SnapApp are processed through a third party payment processing provider.

We also track some of the pages that you visit on our Website through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs). In addition, SnapApp uses third-party service provider partners to employ anonymous cookies for analytical, accounting and data integrity purposes. 

Other sources: We may receive information about you from other sources, including publicly available information or information available from third party sources, such as updated delivery and address information from our carriers or third parties, and add it to our account information, generally for updating purposes. We may also obtain information about you through optional co-registration and/or advertisements on sites operated by third parties.

You may reset your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to reject cookies generally.
