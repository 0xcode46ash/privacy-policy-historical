Our services enable our clients to create and administer their surveys. We may host our clients’ surveys on our servers and collect the responses to those surveys. We may also carry out an analysis of this data to produce reports for you. As a result, if you create a survey using our services:

  * we will hold, store and process survey data for you,

but as explained below we do not use the survey data or contact information ourselves or provide it to third parties, except in the limited circumstances described below.

If you are a respondent to a client survey we will collect and store the responses that you submit, and may carry out an analysis of this data to produce a report to our client. Please note that our client remains responsible for this data and its management, as explained below in ‘How We Use the Information’.

### Storage and Security

The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”).

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information and data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security, and any transmission of data to our website is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
