We collect several types of information from and about users of our Websites, including:

  * information by which you may be personally identified, such as name, postal address, email address or telephone number ("personal information");

  * records and copies of correspondence between you and Sarepta
  * data about your internet connection (including your IP address, operating system and browser type), your search queries on our Websites, the equipment you use to access our Websites and other Website usage details (including traffic data, location data, logs and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on our Websites).
  * Your responses to surveys that we might ask you to complete for research purposes related to our business.



We collect this information:

  * Directly from you when you provide it to us via online forms (e.g. registration forms on our Websites for our services), mail, email, fax, or phone.
  * Automatically as you navigate through our Websites through cookies and other tracking technologies described below.



The information we collect automatically is statistical data, and does not identify any individual. It helps us to improve our Websites and to deliver a better and more personalized service by enabling us to estimate our audience size and usage patterns, store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our Websites according to your individual interests, speed up your searches and recognize you when you return to our Websites.

The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include:

  * **Cookies (browser or flash cookies).** A browser cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. Certain features of our Websites may also use local stored objects (or flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from and on our Websites. You are able to limit access of flash cookies to your computer with add-ons and other tools available online.

  * To present our Websites and their contents to you according to your preferences.
  * To develop statistics and analysis to improve and further develop our Websites and the information and services we may offer from time to time.

Our Websites or forms in which we collect information from you, will have an “Opt-In” option for you to allow Sarepta and companies working on its behalf to communicate with you regarding information and services that may be available to you. If you register for one of our Websites, we may provide you with information or services consistent with the information you provide. For example, if you identify yourself as a parent of a child with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), we may ask you to provide medical information such as the genetic mutation responsible for your child’s disorder. We will use this and other information you may provide to offer you relevant information about DMD, opportunities to participate in clinical trials, products and services, or other information.

  * To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all of Sarepta’s assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by Sarepta about users of our Websites is among the assets transferred.
  * To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it. (For example, if you give us an email address to send information about a DMD diagnosis, we will use that email address to provide such information to you.)
  * With your consent and/or for any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.



We may also disclose your personal information:
