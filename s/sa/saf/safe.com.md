Safe collects Non-Personal and Personal Information when you actively provide it in the context of online and hardcopy surveys, forms, trade shows, communications and evaluation activities including requesting support and licenses. In addition we use cookies and other technologies to passively collect information.

**LOGS**  
As is true of most websites, when you visit [www.safe.com](http://www.safe.com/), we gather certain information automatically and store it in a log file. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) address, top level domain name (for example .com, .gov,. ca, etc.), date and time of visit to the site, Internet Service Provider (ISP), type of browser used, web pages accessed and documents downloaded. The information we gather is used to help us administer our website, monitor traffic, improve the website’s accessibility and navigability and gather general preferences.

**CLICK-THROUGH URLS**  
Some of our email messages contain click-through URLs linked to specific content on the Safe Software website. When you click one of these URLs, you pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our communications. If you prefer not to be tracked, simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email.

**CLEAR GIFs**  
Clear GIFs (a.k.a. beacons or tags) are tiny graphic images placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an email message.

We may use this information to tailor our communications to meet your preferences.

**SOFTWARE USAGE REPORTING**  
Upon installation of a licensed copy of software, we may collect Non-Personal Information. Non-Personal Information will be automatically combined with results gleaned from other users.
