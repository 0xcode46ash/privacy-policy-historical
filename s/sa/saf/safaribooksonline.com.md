1\. Information We Collect

Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) means information that can be directly associated with you (such as your name, email address, or telephone number), or information about activities directly linked to you (such as subscriptions that you have licensed or purchased). We collect PII in the following ways:

1.1  Information that you provide to us directly:

  * When you contact or communicate with Safari, we may gather information such as your name, physical address, email address and phone number
  * When you participate in a promotional offer (such as a trial subscription) and/or purchase products or services, we may gather information regarding the offer that you participate in, and any products or services that you purchase, as well as financial information such as your credit card number.
  * When you register for an online account, subscribe to a newsletter, participate in communities or an event, program, class or promotion, or click on a URL, we may gather user preferences, product interests, industry focus, community choices and other customer profile information.

products and services 

  * Certain products and services that you acquire from us may connect and transmit telemetry and system/product data to us or our authorized agents. This data may include, but is not limited to, system model, operating system, host ID and IP address.



We use this information to manage and administer our products and services, and as the basis for advising you of the availability of updates and new versions, providing agreed upon testing and monitoring of services that we provide, enhancing our products and services, and improving and targeting our communications with you.

  * When you are on Safari's websites, we collect information about the pages you visit. Some web pages use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to automatically collect information from you. We may send one or more cookies (small text files containing a string of characters) to your computer to uniquely identify your browser. We may use "web beacons" (electronic images also known as pixel tags or clear gifs) to recognize a Safari cookie on your computer when you view or act upon a Safari web page, a Safari advertisement posted on a third-party web page, or an   
email from us.
  * Cookies, web beacons and similar technologies enable us to collect information about your visits to our websites, such as:
    * Internet Protocol Address
    * Browser type
    * Operating system
    * Referring site (site you visited before coming to our site)
    * Date and time of visit
    * URL of pages visited
    * Other browsing behavior, such as products and white papers downloade



Most browsers allow you to remove and block cookies and web beacons. If you do so, you will need to re-enter your User Name and password to access certain parts of our web sites and you will be served only generic information that is not focused on your specific interests.  Also, you may not be able to use certain Safari web site features or take full advantage of our offerings.

1.4 Information from other sources

  * From time-to-time we may receive information from other sources, such as commercial contact lists or companies that we acquire, and we may combine that information with information previously collected.
  * If you give us PII on behalf of someone else (or someone else gives us PII on your behalf), we require that the person providing the PII to us must have consent to do so from the person whose information is provided.
  * Some Safari events, web sites or services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with a third party.  When you provide PII in relation to them, both Safari and the third party(ies) may receive the information collected and use the information according to each company's privacy policy and agreement with you.
