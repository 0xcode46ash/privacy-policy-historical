### 1.3 INFORMATION WE COLLECT THROUGH ONLINE TECHNOLOGY:

Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited. 

Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by us and our affiliates, and other companies with whom we do business, such as technology service providers, analytics providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports from these companies based on the use of these technologies by these companies, and the reports may be based on the analysis of individual and/or aggregated usage.

This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.

We engage a third party to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. That third party company may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/).

### 1.4 INFORMATION FROM OTHER SOURCES:

From time-to-time we may receive information from other sources, such as commercial contact lists or companies that we acquire, and we may combine that information with information previously collected.

If you give us PII on behalf of someone else (or someone else gives us PII on your behalf), we require that the person providing the PII to us must have consent to do so from the person whose information is provided. To request the removal of your PII, whether it was provided by you, by a friend, or by a third party marketing company, please see the "Access and Accuracy" section below.

Some Safari events, websites or services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with a third party. When you provide PII in relation to them, both Safari and the third party(ies) may receive the information collected and use the information according to each company's privacy policy and agreement with you. We recommend reading the privacy statement of our co-branding partners as well, if you are accessing our services through a co-branded offering.

We may share or disclose your PII with:

  * Companies that are related to Safari, in order to support business and marketing processes

  * Our websites include links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Safari. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.
  * As necessary, if we suspect a violation of our policies or to protect the rights or safety of any person or entity
  * Government agencies, law enforcement agencies and others, based on a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to respond to judicial process, valid government inquiry, or is otherwise required by law
  * The buyer, if Safari or any of its assets are sold. In the event of a sale of Safari or its assets, you will be notified via a prominent notice on our website of any related change in uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding those changes.

## 6\. SECURITY

Safari uses administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of PII against loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

It is important to us to maintain the accuracy of your contact information. We provide individuals with reasonable access to their PII in order to have it corrected, amended or deleted where it is inaccurate or inappropriate for the specified purposes of processing.

Safari's policy is to share your personal information only if you have given us your consent, for instance, by your agreeing to this Policy through your use of our sites.

At this time our websites do not respond to web browser "do not track" signals or comparable signals or mechanisms. There is much current discussion in the industry, among government agencies, lawmakers, and the public regarding alternative "do not track" response standards. We will continue to monitor "do not track" developments, with the expectation of modifying our policy in the future as these issues are resolved.
