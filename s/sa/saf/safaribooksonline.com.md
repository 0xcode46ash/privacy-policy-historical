* **Information Collection and Use  
**Safari Books Online is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others except as disclosed in this statement. 

Safari Books Online collects information from our users at several different points on our website. We consider all of the information we collect from you to be Personal Identifying Information, including your email address, name, password, mailing address, job information, skill information, demographic information, and credit card information. Safari Books Online uses this information to serve your needs as well as our own legitimate business purposes. Our company may use your Personal Identifying Information to help us improve our Web site, or for our company's marketing and promotional purposes (for example, email announcements of new books in the service). 

All Personal Identifying Information will be treated confidentially within our company. While our policy is not to share this information with third parties, we may share this information with affiliates of Safari Books Online, LLC, as well as with our business partners (for example, reseller sites that offer the Safari electronic reference library services). We may also release personal information when we believe that release is appropriate to comply with the law, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Safari Books Online, our users, or others. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 

When you voluntarily post Personal Identifying Information to a public area of this Web site (for example, public notes), that information may be collected and used by others. Since this information is public, we can't prevent other users from collecting it. 

* **Special Notice to Parents  
**While we have no intention of seeking Personally Identifiable Information about minors who visit this Web site, the same privacy policies will apply to that information. In addition, when we can identify a user as a minor, the Personally Identifiable Information will not be used for further marketing and promotion. We encourage you to ask your children to seek your permission before they provide information about themselves or their family members over the Internet. 

* **Special Notice to Kids  
**Ask your parent or guardian for permission before you send any personal information over the Internet. 

* **Registration  
**To use this website, either as a trial user or a subscriber, you must first complete the registration form. During registration, you're required to give your email. This email address is used to contact you about the services on our site in which you've expressed interest. If you are registering for Safari as a result of a promotional offer, you may also be required to provide additional information as part of the terms of the promotion. 

* **Ordering  
**When you place an order, we request information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number and expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with you. 

* **Cookies  
**Safari Books Online uses "cookies" to improve the quality of your visit to the Safari site by providing you with personalized information and features. Cookies are a software technology that enables our systems to recognize your computer and collect non-personal information about you. This type of information includes: type of browser used to access the Internet (i.e. Netscape 6.2, Internet Explorer 4.0), type of operating system (i.e. Windows 95, Macintosh), and the domain of your Internet service provider. Cookies are anonymous; Safari Books Online does not know the name, email address, phone number, or home address of anyone who visits our site. Safari does not sell or rent any information that we gather through the use of cookies. 

You can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies or to block cookies. If you block cookies, you will not be able to use certain site features or functions. 

* **Log Files  
**We use IP addresses from our log files to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to Personally Identifiable Information. 

* **Sharing  
**We sometimes share aggregated demographic information with our partners and resellers. This is not linked to any information that can identify an individual person. 

We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. This company does not retain, share, store or use Personally Identifiable Information for any secondary purposes. 

When we partner with another party to provide specific services (for example, ship book purchases), we will share names or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. 

These parties are not allowed to use Personally Identifiable Information except for the purpose of providing these services. 

* **Links  
**Safari Books Online contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site, and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects Personally Identifiable Information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Safari Books Online. 

* **Surveys & Contests  
**From time to time, we request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving this site. 

* **Security  
**Safari Books Online takes every commercially reasonable precaution under current industry standards to protect user information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line using those standards. 

When our registration/order form asks you to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industryâ€”SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers (e.g. Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer) becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked (or open) when you are just surfing. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information off-line. All user information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk or customer service representative) are granted access to Personally Identifiable Information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that we store Personally Identifiable Information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage. 

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [techsupport@safaribooksonline.com](mailto:techsupport@safaribooksonline.com "blocked::mailto:techsupport@safaribooksonline.com"). 

* **Special Offers

* **Correction/Updating Personal Information  
**To change your Safari account information (address, credit card, etc.), Login on to your Safari account.Click the "Account" link in the upper right hand corner and follow the instructions for updating your account information, If you have questions or need help with making changes, e-mail [customer-service@safaribooksonline.com](mailto:customer-service@safaribooksonline.com "blocked::mailto:customer-service@safaribooksonline.com"). 

* **Choice/Opt-Out  
**You are always notified when your information is being collected by any outside parties, so that you can make an informed choice as to whether you should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not. 

We will send you email messages when we need to tell you about things that effect your subscription or service. We also occasionally send subscribers email announcements of special offers or new services. You can choose to opt-out of receiving such marketing messages by clicking "unsubscribe" at the bottom of any such e-mail message. 

* **Notification of Changes  
**If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on www.safaribooksonline.com/PRIVACY. If we decide to use Personally Identifiable Information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users via email. Users will be able to opt out of any new use of their personal information. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
