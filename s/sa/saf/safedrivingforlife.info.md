## Introduction

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to set out the manner and purposes for which we will obtain and process your personal information. By using this website, you are consenting to the collection and use of your personal information in the way we describe in this Policy and to our Terms and Conditions.

## Who We Are

This website is hosted and managed by TSO (The Stationery Office Limited). Registered address: 29 St John's Lane, London, EC1M 4NA. TSO is a registered Data Controller as defined by the UK Data Protection Act 1998 (Act). We obtain, process and store personal information in accordance with the Act and all other applicable UK privacy legislation.

## Obtaining Your Personal Information

We may obtain personal information about you when you register to use this website, place an order with us or when you provide feedback about our products or services.

## Processing Your Personal Information

We will use the personal information that you provide us with to process your order for our products or services and to ensure that any goods ordered are delivered to the address specified.

When you place an order with us we may, if necessary, contact you to confirm that we are fulfilling the order in accordance with your instructions and according to our own high standards. We may also contact you to provide or obtain any other pertinent information concerning your order.

When you enquire or provide feedback about our products and services we will use the contact details that you have provided to respond to you.

Any feedback that you provide will help us to understand how our products and services are perceived by our customers and which of our products and services are of most interest. We may use such information to tailor our service offerings to suit your needs and improve our product and service offerings for the benefit of our customers generally.

In order to source the product that you require and ensure that it is delivered to the delivery address that you have specified as quickly as possible, it sometimes may be necessary for us to pass your delivery address details to an external publisher or supplier acting on our behalf to enable them to dispatch the goods that you have ordered directly to you. However, your order will always be managed by TSO and we will only provide our suppliers with the minimum information necessary to facilitate the delivery of the goods to you, such as your name, address and the details of the products to be supplied. Our suppliers have provided sufficient security guarantees in relation to any personal information that we might provide them with for these purposes and they are required to act only on our instructions in relation to any such information.

## Direct Marketing Material

We will use your personal information to keep you informed of products, services and events that we feel may be of interest to you or your business. We may also use your personal information to keep you informed of new and/or existing products that are similar to those which you have previously purchased.

You may at any time ask us to cease or not commence sending you direct marketing material by contacting our customer services division on Tel: +44 (0)333 202 5070 or by sending an email to [tsoproductupdates@tso.co.uk](mailto:tsoproductupdates@tso.co.uk).

Upon receipt of notification that you do not wish to receive marketing material from us, we will action your request within a reasonable time period.

## Email Marketing Communications

TSO offers a free email newsletter subscription service to keep you informed of our products and services. All recipients of our newsletter have either consented to receiving such material or have placed an order with us for similar products or services.

We incorporate a tracking system in our email marketing communications which allows us to monitor whether the email has been opened and which links are the most popular. This allows us to tailor and refine our service to ensure that the emails you receive are relevant to your interests.

Where you have consented to receiving email marketing material from us or are currently receiving material relating to similar products or services, you may at any time ask us to cease sending you such material by sending an email to [tsoproductupdates@tso.co.uk](mailto:tsoproductupdates@tso.co.uk) with the heading unsubscribe or you can go to your [**free updates page**](http://10.254.170.61/webshop/bookstore.asp?ACTION=PRODUCTUPDATES&TRACKID=000578) (you will need to login if you have not already done so) and click the 'unsubscribe' link at the foot of the page. Unsubscribe instructions are also clearly outlined at the bottom of every direct marketing email that we send you.
