|  | Privacy Policy  


The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at SAFRA. Here are the types of information we gather. 




**What About Cookies?**




**Does SAFRA Share the Information It Receives?**

Information about our members is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice. 




**How Secure Is Information About Me?**




**Which Information Can I Access?**

SAFRA gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with SAFRA for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. 

**What Choices Do I Have?**




**Are Children Allowed to Use SAFRA?**

_(Condition of use subject to SAFRAâ€™s policy on online booking of events)._ If you are under 18, you may use SAFRA only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. 

**Disclaimer, Notices, and Revisions**

If you choose to visit SAFRA, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Disclaimer, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the Republic of Singapore. If you have any concern about privacy at SAFRA, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. 

Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the Disclaimer will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of member information collected in the past without the consent of affected members.
