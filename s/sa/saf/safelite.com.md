### BELRON USTM PRIVACY POLICY

Belron US, parent company of SafeliteÂ® AutoGlass, recognizes that your right to privacy is very important. We recognize that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act responsibly. That's why we have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe the types of personal and non-personal information we collect through our various Web sites (collectively, "Web sites"), how we use such information, and to whom we disclose such information.

### WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

**Personal Information**  
In general, we collect personal information from you when you voluntarily provide it to us by registering on any of our Web sites; signing up to enter a promotion, participate in an event or survey, receive newsletters or other literature; making product, project, or service inquiries; and contacting us (including our webmaster, customer service representatives, or other employees) by e-mail.

In connection with these activities, we may collect personal information from you, including, but not limited to, your name, physical address, e-mail address, age, gender, telephone number, fax number, user name and/or password associated with the use of any of our Web sites or web portal(s), occupation, company name, name of position within company, whether you are a customer, how you heard about the Belron US family of brands, and other demographic information.

**Non-personal information**  
As part of the standard operation of our Web sites and in order to better serve you, we may collect/obtain certain non-personal information from you including, but not limited to, your browser type (e.g., Netscape or Internet Explorer), operating system (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), Internet service provider, IP address, Web sites visited, and the domain name from which you accessed the Web sites (e.g., yahoo.com).

In addition, we may collect information about your browsing behavior, such as the date and time you visited our Web sites, the areas or pages of our Web sites that you visit, the amount of time spent viewing our Web sites, the number of times you return to our Web sites, and other click-stream data. We may use cookies to collect this information which may be combined with your personal information. A cookie is a small text file that may be stored on the hard drive of your computer which enables us to recognize your computer when you return to our Web sites.

You are always free to decline cookies, but in doing so you may not be able to use certain features on our Web sites. The "help" segment of the toolbar on most browsers explains how to configure a browser to not accept new cookies, how to have the browser inform a user when they receive a new cookie, and how to erase cookies from a computer's hard drive.

We may use web beacons to assist us in understanding how visitors to our Web Sites use such sites and/or to collect information regarding users' activities on the web. We may utilize the services of a third party to collect such information for us. 

### HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?

We may use the information we collect from you for any of the following purposes: to facilitate your use of our Web sites and better understand your needs; to fulfill your requests for information related to our company, products and services; to send you information, promotional materials, and offers from our company as well as from our subsidiaries and affiliates; to contact visitors to our Web sites when necessary; to help address problems with our Web sites; to administer our Web sites; to conduct internal reviews of our Web sites (e.g., to determine the number of visitors to specific pages within the site); to help us better understand visitors' use of our Web sites; to protect the security or integrity of our Web sites; to consider your request for consideration of employment with the Belron US family of companies; and for such other purposes provided in this Privacy Policy. Non-personal information will be used for these purposes as well to monitor our Web sites and provide a greater online experience for our visitors.

### WILL WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU?

We may disclose information collected from you to the following entities for the following purposes: to Belron US employees, independent contractors, subsidiaries, affiliates, consultants, business associates, service providers, and suppliers, if the disclosure will enable that entity to perform a business, professional, or technical support function for us; to employees, independent contractors, service providers, and suppliers of Belron US to fulfill a product or service request; to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request and/or to cooperate with law enforcement and other authorities in investigating a claim of illegal activity.

We may use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to protect our service, Web sites, customers, or others; and/or to our third-party marketing or service providers who may use such information in their business operations or who may contact you with information they feel may be useful to you.

### DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN?

We do not direct our Web sites to, nor do we knowingly collect any personal information from children.

### DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER PRACTICES ON THIRD-PARTY WEB SITES?

Our Web sites may contain links to other third-party Web sites (including but not limited to those of our marketing partners), which may have privacy policies that differ from our own. We are not responsible for the content, safety, privacy or accessibility of any information provided on third-party Web sites. Accordingly, we recommend you review the privacy policy posted on any Web site that you may access through our Web sites.

### HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?

While we strive to safeguard your personal information, data transmissions over the Internet, including e-mail, cannot be guaranteed 100 percent secure. Therefore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit, and any information you transmit is done at your own risk. We cannot be responsible for disclosures of your personal information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties, and we encourage you to exercise prudence in selecting the information you send via the Internet, including via e-mail.

### WILL THERE BE CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY IN THE FUTURE?

To improve our ability to serve you, we may make modifications, improvements, deletions, or amendments to the Web sites at any time we deem appropriate. We recommend that you revisit this Privacy Policy periodically to ensure that you are aware of our current privacy practices. Your continued use of our services following any changes signifies your acceptance of these changes.
