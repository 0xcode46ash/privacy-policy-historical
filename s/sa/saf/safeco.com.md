We collect personal information about you from:

#### Safeco's use of your personal information

We treat your information with respect and concern for your privacy. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our customers or former customers to anyone, except as permitted by law.

For example, we may share any or all of your information with our affiliated companies and independent Safeco representatives C Independent Insurance Agents and Financial Advisors authorized to sell Safeco products. We may also disclose any or all information we have collected about you to companies that perform services on our behalf and to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements.

When we make this type of disclosure it is done to service your Safeco account or policy, or to inform you about Safeco products and services. Before disclosing your information, we require these companies to promise to keep it confidential and use it only for the transaction we request.

#### Independent Safeco Representatives

The Independent Insurance Agents and Financial Advisors authorized to sell Safeco products and services are not Safeco employees and not subject to Safeco`s Privacy Policy. Because they have a unique business relationship with you, they may have additional personal information about you that Safeco does not have. They may use this information differently than Safeco. Contact your Safeco agent or advisor to learn more about their privacy practices.
