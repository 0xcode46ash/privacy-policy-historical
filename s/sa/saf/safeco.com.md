# Safeco - Consumer Privacy Policy

### Consumer Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 07/06/2006

Safeco appreciates the trust you place in us when you purchase insurance from one of our companies. We are committed to protecting your nonpublic personal information ("personal information") and we value you as a customer. 

To learn more about how Safeco collects and uses your personal information, please read the following notice. 

#### Safeco's sources of information about you

We collect personal information about you from different sources, including:

  * The information you provide on applications or other forms (such as your name, address and Social Security number) 
  * Your transactions with us, our affiliates or others (such as your payment history and claims information) 
  * The information we receive from a consumer reporting agency or insurance support organization (such as your credit history, driving record or claims history) 
  * Your independent insurance distributor (such as updated information pertaining to your account) 



#### Safeco's use of your personal information

We only disclose personal information about our customers and former customers as permitted by law. Generally, this includes disclosures to third parties to effect, administer or enforce your transactions with us, or in connection with servicing your insurance policy. These third parties may include independent insurance producers authorized to sell Safeco insurance products, independent contractors (such as automobile repair facilities and property inspectors), independent claims representatives, insurance support organizations, auditors, attorneys, courts and government agencies. We may also disclose your personal information to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements. Before disclosing your personal information, we require these parties to enter into an agreement with us that includes a confidentiality provision. 

We may also share information about our transactions (such as payment history and products purchased) and experiences (such as claims made) with you within our Safeco family of companies. 

Safeco does not sell your personal information to others and we do not provide your information to third parties for their own marketing purposes.

#### Independent Safeco Representatives

The independent insurance agents and brokers authorized to sell Safeco products and services are not Safeco employees and are not subject to Safeco`s Privacy Policy. Because they have a unique business relationship with you, they may have additional personal information about you that Safeco does not have. They may use this information differently than Safeco. Contact your Safeco agent or broker to learn more about their privacy practices.
