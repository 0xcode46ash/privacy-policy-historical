# Privacy Policy | Safestyle UK

You have to trust the ones that you love. That’s why we have this document. Our Privacy Policy is here to reassure you about how Safestyle UK collect, use and transfer information we collect from this website.

When you share your information with us, we assume that you are happy to use it. After all, you wouldn’t give us your number if you didn’t want us to call, would you? So any information that you input into this website means that you consent to the collection, use and transfer in accordance with the terms of this policy.

Of course, we have to reserve the right to change this policy from time to time at our sole discretion – that’s just because life isn’t always set in stone is it? So it is your responsibility to check this policy regularly to ensure that you are aware of any changes. When you use of this website after a change has been posted that means that you accept of the modified privacy policy – so please make sure that you check this regularly.

## If you do not accept the terms of this policy, then simply don’t use this website and everyone will be happy.

## Information we may collect from you

When you visit, use or register with this website, you may be asked to provide certain information about yourself, including personal details. We may also ask you for information when you report a problem with our site and, if you contact us, we may keep a record of correspondence. That’s perfectly normal, in fact we would be pretty negligent if we didn’t keep records.

We also want to know what people do and don’t like about our website. So we may also collect information about your usage of this website as you and others browse our website (see section below on "Cookies").

There’s a reason for all of this. It’s to make your experience more helpful and relevant to you. So that’s why the information you provide to us will enable us to provide you with access to all parts of our website and will be used for several general purposes including: administering business activities; providing information, products and services you have requested or subscribed to; personalising your experience on this website; quality assurance monitoring; and keeping you up to date with our products and services. 

Also, sometimes we discover products and services that we think you might like. And we may allow carefully selected third parties to contact you about products or services which may be of interest to you. You acknowledge and agree that we may (and such third parties may) contact you by post, telephone or fax as well as by email. Of course, we always give you the chance to say no to this. That’s why we give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving this information at the appropriate section of the website when you register your details. If you no longer wish to be contacted in the future by us, or any of the third parties, then we won’t be offended. Simply send an email to : [customerservices@safestyle.co.uk] and insert "unsubscribe" or "stop" as the appropriate subject heading.

We will retain the personal information provided by you for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes listed in this policy.

## Disclosure of your information

We take care of your information you provide us with. It will be held by us and may only be accessed by us or any third party for the purposes set out in this policy. If we want to do anything else with it, we will always ask you first.

Now we are not planning on going anywhere. But if we sell, assign or transfer the assets of our business, or if our business is sold or merged, or if we enter into a joint venture with another business entity, we reserve the right to sell the databases maintained by the company in connection with this website (including any personal information provided by you).

Now we also have a legal and moral obligation. And, although we are sure this doesn’t apply to you, but we may also disclose personal information to third parties if: we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation; or in order to enforce or apply our terms and conditions and any other agreements with you; or to protect the rights, property or safety of our company, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

## IP addresses and cookies

Not the chocolate chip variety we’re afraid, but similar to other commercial websites, this website utilises a standard technology called 'cookies' and web server log files to collect information about how this website is used. A 'cookie' is a small piece of information sent from our website to your computer to help us to identify you quickly. The information we collect allows us to monitor website traffic and to personalise content of the website for you. The information we collect is anonymous.

So if you decide that you don’t like our cookies, then you don’t need to accept them and may alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies it is possible that some areas of this website will not function as effectively when viewed.

## Customer Reviews

By uploading text or images to our reviews and show us your windows section you are telling us that you are happy for us to use both the text and images on our website. Oh, and thanks for sharing them!

## Security

Now we know that there are some people that are not quite as nice as you and us. There are people that want your information. But you don’t need to worry unnecessarily. Because we employ security measures to protect the information provided by you from access by unauthorised persons (nasty people) and against unlawful processing (doing nasty things with it), accidental loss (leaving it on a bus), destruction or damage. So relax – your information is safe with us).

## Your rights

Life changes. And so does your information. So you may ask us to make changes to the information provided by you and/or held about you, to ensure that it is accurate and kept up to date. You may also request that we cease from processing your personal information and that we delete your data from our database or records. That’s fine – you just need to let us know. However, please note that it may be impossible to completely delete your information because of back-ups and records of deletions.

And finally – you can be sure that we will only do things with your information to the extent that such activities will not compromise privacy, security or any other legal interests.
