# Safariland™ - Privacy Policy

## Effective Date: December 16, 2009

Safariland, LLC (“company”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy statement explains data collection and use practices of the company in connection with this Web site (the “site”). It governs your use of the website and our services and products, including all software, features, and tools offered by or through us. By accessing the site, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this privacy statement. We do not sell any personal information. The information that you provide will be kept confidential and used to support your relationship with us.

## Collection of Your Personal Information

We may collect, store and use information that personally identifies you (“personal information”) for defined purposes. We may use the information to support and enhance the relationship with you, such as delivering information about our products and services to you, assisting you in signing up for an event or training, or when you purchase, download and/or register our products. The personal information we collect may include, but is not limited to, the following:

  1. Registration-related: name, title, company or organization name, e-mail address(es), phone number(s), fax number(s), work and/or home address(es), birth date, gender, information about your job function, and general information about your company or organization;
  2. Transaction-related: shipping and billing information, credit card information or other preferred payment means, history of purchases;
  3. Information about use: frequency of use, responses to offerings, types of features used;
  4. Customer service information: account information;
  5. Aggregated information; and
  6. Supplemented information about you received from other companies.



The site may also collect certain technical information about your visit. It can include information, such as the name of the Internet service provider and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you access the Internet; the type of operating system you are using, the date and time you accessed the site; the pages that you access while at the site, your manner of connecting to the Internet, the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site, other information about your geographic location, and the domain name of your Internet service provider.

## Use of Personal Information Collected

The personal information collected on this site will be used to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized. In support of these uses, we may use personal information to provide you with more effective customer service, to improve the site and any related products or services, and to make the site easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing the site to your particular preference or interests.

We may use your personal information to provide you with important information about the products or services that you are using, including critical updates and notifications. Additionally, with your permission, we may share information with our partners so they may send you information about their products and services.

When you sign up to receive promotional e-mail, we may use customized links or similar technologies to track e-mail links that you click. We may associate that information with your personal information in order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or purchase information. Each e-mail communication includes an unsubscribe link allowing you to stop delivery of that type of communication.

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as website hosting, packaging, mailing and delivering prizes, and sending information about our products, special offers, and other services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and abide by this privacy policy, and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

We may share your information within the company and its business divisions. Your information will not be shared with third parties unless it is necessary to fulfill a transaction you have requested, or in other circumstances in which you have consented to the sharing of your information. They are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. We may use your information to present offers to you on behalf of business partners. These business partners may receive aggregate data about groups of users, but do not receive information that personally identifies you.

We may also use the personal data collected for internal purposes, namely, for solving technical problems, calculating overall usage statistics, internal marketing and promotional purposes, product development and content improvement.

We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on us or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of the company; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our employees or agents, users of our products or services, or members of the public. We will cooperate with law enforcement authorities.

We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer of ownership, such as acquisition by or merger with another company. In such an event, we will notify you before information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. We also encourage you to periodically check this page for policy updates.

## Security of your Personal Information

We pay close attention to security. The company is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities.

We focus significant time and resources to ensure that user accounts and information are not misused by employees. A limited set of employees are authorized to access user accounts. They are educated about the importance of maintaining user privacy, and their access to user accounts is recorded. Our employees can access accounts and log data only for quality, security, audit, and other internal business purposes. We also implement technology and procedures to try to make sure that external parties cannot access or modify users’ personal information on our servers. These technologies and procedures include industry standard methods as well as our own proprietary methods. Nevertheless, please note that we cannot guarantee perfect security so that your personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.

## Customized Experience

We may place Internet “cookies” on your hard drives, or use Web beacons or similar technology to enhance and personalize your experience on the site. A "cookie" is a small line of text that is stored with your Web browser for record-keeping purposes and helps us provide better service to you. When you revisit the site, we may recognize you by the Internet cookie and customize your experience accordingly. We only store the minimal amount of information required to identify you. You may decline Internet cookies, if any, by using the appropriate feature of your Web client software, if available. However, declining to use cookies may impede the ability of the site to function properly.

When you perform a search within our site, we may record information identifying you or linking you to the search performed. We may also record limited information associated with every search request made by you and use that information to, among other things, solve technical problems with the service and to calculate overall usage statistics. This information is used to help improve the site, analyze trends and administer the site. Some of our sites collect information about your hardware and software in order to provide a requested service.

## Links to Other Sites

We may provide links to other sites on the Internet for your convenience to locate related information and services. These sites have not necessarily been reviewed by us and are maintained by third parties over which we exercise no control. Accordingly, we expressly disclaim any responsibility for the privacy policies, information collection practices, content, accuracy of the information, and/or quality of products or services provided by or advertised on these third-party websites. Moreover, these links do not imply an endorsement with respect to any third party or any website or the products or services provided by any third party.

## Changes to this Statement

We may occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy statement. For material changes to this privacy statement, we will notify you either by placing a prominent notice on the home page of our website or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this privacy statement to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. Your continued use of the service constitutes your agreement to this privacy statement and any updates.
