# SAS Institute Inc. | Privacy Statement

| Our Commitment to Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. SAS, our subsidiaries and affiliates ("SAS" or "we") are providing this notice to describe and explain our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. 

#### THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT

In general, you can visit this web site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may need information from you. Personal information like your name, postal address and e-mail address is obtained only when voluntarily submitted. SAS collects this information in several ways: 

  * Through the SAS Profile page (see below) 
  * Through registration, surveys and other online forms 
  * As part of an ongoing sales process 
  * While providing technical support, consultation, or product information 
  * Through the process of maintaining and upgrading our products 
  * Through automated means such as communications protocols, e-mail communications and cookies 

To provide you with timely, high-quality information, we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your professional interests and experiences with our products or services. Providing us with this information is optional. 

Personal data collected online may also be combined with information you provide to us through other sources such as product registration, call centers, or in conjunction with events such as trade shows, training seminars and conferences. Information that you supply will relate to the relationship that SAS has with you or your organization.

Web Server Logs  
In the process of administering this site, we maintain and track usage through Web server logs. Web server logs provide information such as what types of browsers are accessing our site, what pages receive high traffic, and the times of day our servers experience significant load. We use this information to improve the content and navigation features of our site. Anonymized or aggregated forms of this data may be used to identify future features and functions to develop for the site and to provide better customer service. 

Cookies  
There are various technologies, including one called "cookies" which can be used to provide tailored information from a Web site. A cookie is an element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. Some SAS pages use cookies or other technologies so that we can better serve you when you return to our site. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. For more information, please refer to user information provided with your Web browser. 

Web Beacons  
Some of our Web pages and HTML-formatted e-mail use Web beacons in conjunction with cookies to compile aggregate statistics about web site usage. A Web beacon is an electronic image, called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on a visitor's computer, such as a visitor's cookie number, time and date of a page view and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed. You may render some Web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies. 

Personalized URL Links and Personalized Message Content  
Occasionally, we may create a unique web URL link for certain visitors. If you visit one of these sites, you may find forms that are already filled out with your name, or other types of information you have previously indicated an interest in, based on information you have given us before. 

We may also personalize the content of newsletters, e-mail offers or invitations based on topics in which you have previously indicated an interest. We collect information about how you consume this type of personalized information in order to help us provide you with other information that is better tailored to your interests. 

If you choose to visit one of these personalized web URL links, you are agreeing to allow SAS to collect information about your visits and also to associate that information with other information about you and your relationship with SAS. If you do not wish your information to be used in this way, do not accept the invitation to visit these sites. 

If you decided that you want to fine-tune the information that SAS is providing to you, we invite you to update your [SAS Profile](http://www.sas.com/profile).
