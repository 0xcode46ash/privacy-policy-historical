**Web Server Logs**  
In the process of administering this site, we maintain and track usage through Web server logs. Web server logs provide information such as what types of browsers are accessing our site, what pages receive high traffic, and the times of day our servers experience significant load. We use this information to improve the content and navigation features of our site. Anonymized or aggregated forms of this data may be used to identify future features and functions to develop for the site and to provide better customer service. 

**Cookies**  
Certain technologies, called "cookies," can be used to provide tailored information from a website. A cookie is an element of data that a website can send to your browser, which your browser may then store on your system. Some pages on our site use cookies that assist you in navigating and using the site, for example, to help you access secure areas or use a shopping cart. SAS may set these types of cookies without requesting your consent. 

Other pages on the site may set cookies to collect aggregate usage information that we use to improve how the site works.

SAS may work with select third-party partners who set cookies to serve you SAS-related content, including SAS advertisements, on their sites or elsewhere on the Internet, based on your prior visits to our site. SAS also sets cookies that look at your preferences when you use the website so that SAS may offer you tailored marketing collateral, such as whitepapers, that you may be interested in.

We may also personalize the content of newsletters, e-mail offers, invitations, or SAS advertisements served to you on our third party partners’ websites, based on topics in which you have previously indicated an interest. We collect information about how you consume this type of personalized information in order to help us provide you with other information that is better tailored to your interests. If you choose to visit one of these personalized web URL links, you are agreeing to allow SAS to collect information about your visits and also to associate that information with other information about you and your relationship with SAS.
