# SANS Web Privacy Policy

SANS is very sensitive to privacy issues on the Internet. We believe it is important you know how we treat the information about you we receive on the Internet.

In general, you can visit most portions of our web site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our web servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. This information is occasionally tabulated to measure various statistics but is never released.

Sometimes, you might enter an email address or other information. Unless prominently and specifically stated otherwise, information (such as e-mail or surface mail addresses) is shared outside of SANS only with the USENIX Association for occasional mailings of relevant material.
