# City of Santa Clara : Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us. We have updated our Privacy Policy and are in full compliance with the [California Online Privacy Act of 2003](http://www.cooley.com/57676) and [California Senate Bill 1386](http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/01-02/bill/sen/sb_1351-1400/sb_1386_bill_20020926_chaptered.html).

 Our Commitment to Your Privacy and Security  
The City of Santa Clara (the City) has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate the City's firm commitment to privacy and the security of your personal information. The following information explains our policy regarding any personal information you may supply to us when visiting the [santaclaraca.gov](http://santaclaraca.gov/) domain. 

The City's goal in collecting personal information online is to provide you with the most effective service possible. By understanding your needs and preferences, the City will be in the better position to provide you with improved service. Our goal is to protect your online information in the same manner that we protect citizen and business information obtained through other means. 

Personally Identifiable Information We Collect   
Personal information we collect from you and store in our databases/servers:

  * Your first and last name 
  * Your account personal identification number (PIN) 
  * Your client barcode (if applicable) 
  * Your email address 
  * Your phone number
  * Your business certificate account number
  * Your preparer name, phone number and digital signature



Information we capture but do not store in our databases/servers:

  * Your credit card billing address 
  * Your credit card type 
  * Your credit card number and card security code (CSC)
  * The name on your card 
  * Your credit card expiration date 



What We Do to Secure Your Information  
We store your personal information in databases on servers located behind a firewall in order to protect against the unauthorized access to, or the compromise of, information contained on our servers. 

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. When you login to view your account information, we ensure your privacy by encrypting your password, and related information sent between your browser and our server using industry standard 128-bit cryptography so that if this information is intercepted, it cannot be read. 

However, you should know that in the present technological environment, no security measures are perfect, and that neither we nor any other Internet site can fully eliminate these security risks. 

Should there be an unauthorized access or suspected compromise of your personal information on our servers, we will immediately notify you through a written letter or other means so that you will be able to quickly take steps to prevent possible identity theft. 

Email Address   
On certain occasions, we may request your email address for purposes of correspondence or for City business. The City will not share email addresses with anyone outside the City or disclose user information to any third party, unless under a court order, including but not limited to the California Public Records Act. 

Log Files   
The City does not release any information about the collection of IP addresses to any third party except under court order. The City's website archives web server log files in order to create aggregate statistical reports, detect errors at the website, and implement security protocols. Aggregate reports about website visitors are generated. These reports do not contain any personally identifiable information. The web log files are eventually deleted. 

Direct Mail   
In the future, the City may use the personal data provided online to send you information about the City services and upcoming civic activities. We will neither sell nor provide your personal information for any other direct mail activities, unless under court order. 

Security   
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
