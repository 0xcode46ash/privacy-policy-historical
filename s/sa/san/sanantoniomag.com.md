# Privacy Policy

**Updated: 5/11/2007**

The Conley Publishing Group (hereinafter “Conley”) takes certain steps to protect visitors’ privacy and handle certain personal information we obtain from visitors with respect. The Conley sites include, but are not limited to, tusconlifestyle.com, sanantoniomag.com, tusconhomeandgarden.com, tusconlifestyleweddings.com, and gmtoday.com. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policies. 

Conley does not knowingly collect or solicit personally-identifiable information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If we discover that we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe any of Conley’s sites has any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at this email address: [webmaster@conleynet.com](mailto:webmaster@conleynet.com). 

**WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVERS**   
This Privacy Policy covers how Conley treats personal information that Conley collects and receives on the Web sites where this Privacy Policy is posted. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. For purposes of this policy, other information that is directly associated with personally identifiable information, such as consumer product preferences, becomes personally identifiable information. Sometimes we will refer to personally identifiable information as “personal information.” 

This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Conley does not own or control, or to people that Conley does not employ or manage. 

**WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU**

Information You Provide   
Personal information is collected when you register with Conley for services, products, and information updates. Typically, this information may include your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number. We may also request information, which you may voluntarily provide, such as gender, age, number of children, and personal interests. This information will be identified as “optional” during the registration process. If you purchase products or services from us, we will gather information that is necessary to complete the transaction you have requested. This may include credit card information, the type of products or services ordered or purchased, and the date of the order or purchase. We also gather personal information from, for example, sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional offers, voting, polling, message boards and chat rooms, registration for subscription services related to either the printed or electronic editions of content, newspapers, and the like, or from other interactive areas of our sites. 

Technologically Collected Information   
Technology allows us to collect several types of information to make our sites more interesting and useful. For example, when you visit a Conley site, we log your IP address, or the portal through which your computer enters the internet. A portal may be your internet service provider or your company, for example. By itself, your IP address is not personally identifiable. We may also use IP addresses to collect information as to how frequently various parts of our sites are visited. This information may be combined with personal information. 

The Conley sites also use cookies. Once you have registered with us, pieces of information (cookies) are sent by our Web site to your computer while you are viewing the Web site. When you return to one of our sites and log in, cookies allow our Web sites to remember who you are. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can set your browser to refuse to accept cookies. If you refuse to accept cookies, you can still use the Conley sites, but you may not have access to some of our services or to many features that may make your Web experience better. 

Many advertisements are placed on our Web sites and managed by third parties. These parties may also use cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information when you move your cursor over or click on one of their advertisements. We may have access to information from cookies used by third parties on our sites. This information may permit us to identify other sites that you have visited that are associated with the third party. Once you have clicked on an advertisement and left our sites, our Privacy Policy no longer applies. These third parties may have their own privacy policies, which you must read to see how your personal information will be handled on their sites. 

Please be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personal information on message boards or in chat areas of our sites, that information can be collected without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Conley. 

**HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED**

Conley   
We may use your personal information in several ways, including sending you promotional materials, and sharing your information with third parties so they can send you promotional materials. (“Promotional materials” refers to communications that promote the use of our Web sites or the purchase of products or services). As described below, you may choose to “opt-out” of certain uses of your personally identifiable information. 

We may use your personal information for purposes other than sending you promotional materials. For instance, we may use your personally identifiable information to communicate with you about your account, features of our Web sites such as our Terms and Conditions of Use and Privacy Policy, or improvements to our Web sites. We may also use your information to complete transactions you have requested (such as the purchase through our Web sites of a product or service). 

We may take your personal information and combine it with similar information obtained from other users to create profiles of Conley Web site users as a whole and to identify their preferences in content and advertising. This aggregated information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners as well as used by Conley and its related companies. 

Third Parties   
Subject to opt-out choices made by you, Conley may share your personal information with third parties so that they can send you promotional materials. Your personal information will become permanently subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third party when we share your information. The third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy. 

Conley may also share your personal information when you engage in certain activities on our Web sites that are sponsored by third parties, such as participating in contests, sweepstakes or games sponsored by others, purchasing products or services from a third party, or electing to receive information from a third party. 

When you authorize a third party to use your personal information, we may also share your personal information. When you participate in these activities, you will either be requested or required to agree that the sponsor or business associate may use your personal information in accordance with their privacy policies. Since you will have consented to this instance of sharing your personal information, the opt-out choice will not apply. 

Conley may sometimes use shipping companies to provide products or services. For example, a company might help fulfill prizes for a contest. In these types of situations, it is necessary to share your personal information with these companies. 

In some circumstances, your dealings with a third party may have authorized that third party to obtain your personal information from Conley and use that information in accordance with their own privacy policies. Your opt-out choices will not apply to these circumstances. Only the information that you authorized (unless separately permitted under other provisions of this Policy) will be provided to these companies. 

We transfer your personally identifiable information if Conley acquires or is acquired by, or merges with another company. 

To Comply With Law and to Help Protect the Safety and Security of You, Conley, and Others 

Regardless of any opt-out choices that you make, Conley will disclose personal information when responding to subpoenas, court orders, or legal processes when it is necessary to share information in order to prevent or investigate illegal activities, suspected fraud, violations of Conley’s terms and conditions of use, or as otherwise required by law. Conley will also disclose personal information when it believes in good faith that such disclosures will help to enforce contest, sweepstakes, game, or promotion rules; protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of your property; and/or protect the safety and security of our Web sites and property, as well as that of third parties. 

**YOUR CHOICES REGARDING THE COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR INFORMATION**   
With regard to your personal information, you have opt-out choices which are the means by which you give us, or decline to give us, your consent to use your personally identifiable information for the purposes covered by these choices. If you prefer that we do not use your registration information to allow you to receive information like promotional materials from third parties, you may decline during the registration process. Conley uses reasonable security measures to protect your information, but does not guarantee the security of your personal information. 

**UPDATING YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION AND OPT-OUT CHOICES**   
You may access and update your contact information or modify your opt-out choices by contacting us at [webmaster@conleynet.com](mailto:webmaster@conleynet.com). It may take up to four weeks for changes to your opt-out choices to take effect. 

**QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ABOUT THIS PRIVACY POLICY?**   
If you have questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [webmaster@conleynet.com](mailto:webmaster@conleynet.com). 

**PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES**   
We reserve the right to make amendments to this Privacy Policy at any time. We will notify you of any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share your personally identifiable information by prominently posting notice on the Web sites covered by this Privacy Policy. 

Any material changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective thirty (30) days following our posting of notice of the changes on the Web sites covered by this policy. Changes to this Privacy Policy may affect our use of personally identifiable information that you provided to us prior to our notification of the changes. If you do not wish to permit changes in our use of your information, you must notify us that you wish to deactivate your account with us prior to the effective date of the changes.
