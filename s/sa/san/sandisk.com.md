**COLLECTED INFORMATION AND USAGE**

SanDisk collects and uses information you provide to us or that we learn from your use of this web site. We are not in the business of selling information about you. SanDisk does not share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We may share your personal information where it is necessary for us to complete a transaction or do something that you have asked us to do. For example, we might need to provide your personal information to one of our vendors so that they can process and fulfill your product return or replacement. We might also refer your personal information to another manufacturer so that they can provide you with technical assistance for their product which you may be using in conjunction with one of our products. Whenever we may need to share your personal information, we try to provide you with the information you need to make informed reasonable choices. 

SanDisk collects and uses personal information from you in several ways:   


  * **Web Site Usage.** SanDisk, or SanDisk authorized service providers, may observe your activities, preferences, and transactional data (such as your IP address and browser type) relating to your use of this web site. While we may collect or log this information, we generally do not identify you or match this information with your other personal information. We may use this collected or logged information to diagnose web site technical problems, or to facilitate your use of the site. SanDisk, or one of our authorized service providers, also may use this information to track aggregate traffic patterns throughout this web site. EU visitors should refer to SanDisk’s [EU Cookie & Privacy Notice](https://web.archive.org/corporate/privacy-eu.asp) for a more complete cookie explanation as the use of cookies and related technologies may be understood differently in the EU. 
  * **Online Transactions.** You may be asked to share personal information in order to complete a transaction. When you purchase a SanDisk product online you may be asked for information needed to complete your order, contact you to confirm the order and, provide related customer service. This information is used, for example, to effect your transactions, to create and share aggregate reports about these transactions, and to perform credit fraud screening services for transactions between you and SanDisk and/or our authorized service providers. When you “buy direct” these purchase transactions are conducted through our distributor, eSend subject to eSend's privacy policy and contractual restrictions that limit eSend's use of your personal information to ways that you have authorized. Please note that eSend only accepts orders from SanDisk.com visitors in the United States and Canada.
  * **Product Registration & Technical Support. **SanDisk allows all purchasers of its products to register their products online. Personal information or data provided via online product registration forms is used to carry out the request, service or agreement for which the information is submitted. With your consent, we may also use the information you provide in online registration forms to notify you periodically about important changes to the web site (such as a change to this privacy policy or notice of a security breach), new SanDisk products and services, and special offers and contests that may be of interest to you. When you register, we ask for, among other things, your name, address, email, telephone number, type of product purchased and serial number or other product-identifying information, and date of purchase. 

You are also invited to share other personal information about yourself through what is known as an [eBox](https://www.customernation.com/pls/ps/ps_ebox.ebox_help?p_host=304). When you register your purchase with us and create an eBox, you are given control over and access to the personal information you provide in your eBox. Our technology partner, CustomerNation, the provider of eBox, manages your personal information in a way that enables you to control what we know about you and lets you decide how and when we can communicate with you. You can learn about [CustomerNation](http://www.customernation.com/) and its privacy policies by clicking [here](https://www.customernation.com/pls/ps/cn_aboutus.privacy).

Some information or data you may place in your eBox is not required to register your products. Where completion of data fields in your eBox is required, these fields will be marked with an asterisk. Where you provide optional information, such as information about your interests and hobbies, SanDisk only uses this information on an aggregate basis to enable us to better understand our customers, develop new products, and improve our products and services. SanDisk lmits the access of our service providers and vendors who assist with product registration, technical support and customer service through the use of confidentiality provisions and agreements that are intended to enforce this privacy policy.

We do not share product registration information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

Failure to register your product will not diminish the rights you have under the product warranty.

If and whenever you want to modify how we use your personal information or, if you prefer that we deactivate your personal information so that it is not readily accessible or usable, we will do our best to accommodate you. Click here for instructions. 

  * **Recruitment and Job Applications.** You may provide us with personal information, such as that contained on a resume or a curriculum vitae, in connection with a job application or inquiry. We may use this information throughout SanDisk (worldwide) for the purpose of employment consideration or your inquiry. We may keep your information on file for future consideration. EU applicants should consult SanDisk’s [EU Cookie & Privacy Notice](https://web.archive.org/corporate/privacy-eu.asp#employment) for additional information.
  * **Children.** Children under 13 should not send any information about themselves to SanDisk. If a child under 13 submits information through any part of the SanDisk web site, and we learn the person submitting the information is a child, we will attempt to delete this information as soon as possible. Because we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13, we do not use or disclose such information to third parties. 
  * **Public Areas.** Any information disclosed in public areas of the SanDisk web site will become public information. We cannot control the use of information disclosed in public forums, such as bulletin boards and chat rooms. You should exercise caution when disclosing information in these public areas and should refrain from disclosing your personal information. 



**USE OF COLLECTED INFORMATION**

  * **SanDisk Service Suppliers.** SanDisk works with some authorized service providers to provide technical and customer support, shipping, credit card processing, product fulfillment or other services. Where practical, SanDisk requires these companies to safeguard personal information you provide to us. To the extent it is necessary for these service providers to complete their contractual obligations to SanDisk, these third parties may have access to or process your personal information. SanDisk generally limits their use of your personal information to the purpose for which it was shared. SanDisk may sometimes permit our authorized service providers to have access to aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information. 


  * **Mergers, Acquisitions and Bankruptcy.** If SanDisk should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company, or if SanDisk should decide to buy, sell or reorganize some part or all of its business, SanDisk may be required to disclose your personal information, including information you have allowed us to see or use in your eBox, to prospective or actual purchasers or receive personal information from sellers. It is SanDisk’s practice to seek appropriate protection for information disclosed or received in these types of transactions.
  * **As Required by Law and Other Extraordinary Disclosures.** SanDisk may be required to disclose your personal information: (i) if it believes it is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, etc.) or other legal requirements of any governmental authority; (ii) would potentially mitigate our liability in an actual or potential lawsuit; (iii) is otherwise necessary to protect our rights or property; or (iv) is necessary protect the interest of other users of our web site.

**INTERNATIONAL VISITORS AND CUSTOMERS**

  * **SanDisk Worldwide.** Because SanDisk operates globally, circumstances could arise where it is necessary for us to make your personal information available to our worldwide business units. Privacy laws differ across the globe. To help visitors from countries outside the United States understand our privacy practices we provide special information on our privacy policies that may be applicable to these visitors. If it is necessary for the purposes for which you have shared personal information with us for us to share your information within SanDisk’s global operations, we will do so consistent with this policy.

Customer and technical support is available through this web site and via telephone for our European customers. These services are provided in the United States subject to the Safe Harbor principles.
