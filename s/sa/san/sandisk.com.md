**Privacy statement updates**

SanDisk may update this privacy statement from time to time. If we change our privacy statement, we will post the revised statement on our websites along with a notice indicating that the privacy statement has been updated. The revised privacy statement will supersede and replace any previous privacy policies effective as of the date on which the revised statement is posted. Your continued use of our websites, products or services after any change represents and confirms your consent and agreement to any such changes. This Privacy Policy went into effect on January 1, 2014. The prior policy can be found here [here](https://web.archive.org/about-sandisk/privacy-policy/archived-privacypolicy).

**Information we collect**

We collect different types of information, including both personal and non-personal information. “Personal information” is information that can be used to identify you, including your name, postal or physical address, telephone number, e-mail address, and other information you have provided or is required to carry out a transaction, provide a service or deliver a product. Depending on where you live, personal information may also include your real-time location, your device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address or unique device identifier (UDI). We may collect and store information you or others provide in community discussions, chats, and correspondence received through our websites and correspondence sent to us directly.

Portions of our sites may only be accessible if you register. When you register we will ask you to provide a user name and password. We will retain this information to remember you when you log in. This information may be linked to other information that we collect while you are on the sites.

Prospective employees may submit information to apply for employment with SanDisk by visiting the Careers page, which may be operated by an authorized vendor. Information collected through an online job application may include name, address, telephone and fax numbers, email address, education history, military service, immigration status and employment history or other information. Information provided through this process is subject to the privacy policy of the third party vendor, which you should review before providing information.

**The collection and use of your personal information may be necessary for us to provide you with a product or service, communicate with you, or maintain our relationship with you. Please note that if you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not be able to provide these things to you, in part or at all.**

We also collect other, non-personal types of data, including device information such as the type of browser or operating system used and SanDisk software usage statistics. We use this data, and may compile and analyze the data, in order to improve products and services, and to personalize your experience with us. Examples of non-personal information includes hardware configuration, computer or device characteristics and connection information such as browser type, version and timezone setting, operating system, and platform; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through and from our websites including date and time; cookie number; and the products you viewed, searched or purchased.

**How we collect information**

Much of the personal information we collect is collected online or through our software applications, but we also collect personal information off-line such as through customer service call centers, at in-person events, and through postal mail (such as rebate or warranty cards you send to us via mail).

Personal and non-personal information collected through one SanDisk product or service may be combined with information collected through or in connection with another SanDisk product or service.

**Cookies and other technologies we use**

We use cookies (small files placed on your hard drive), web beacons, website analytics tools, and the personal information you provide us to personalize your online experience and improve our services. Please see our [Cookie Statement](https://web.archive.org/about-sandisk/cookie-policy/ "Cookie Policy") for additional information. By accessing SanDisk sites, you consent to the placement of cookies on your browser or device.

This site is capable of recognizing when your Web browser is set to a “Do Not Track” setting or other mechanisms that allow you to exercise a choice regarding our collection of information listed in our Cookie Statement about your online activities over time or across third-party websites. We engage advertisers who may collect such information in order to provide advertisements that are more relevant to your interests.

**Use of personal information**

You agree that we may use your personal information for our commercial purposes including, for instance:

  * To deliver a product or provide a service you have requested or to provide you with product registration, technical and customer support;
  * To administer promotions that you enter such as a contest or sweepstakes;
  * To consider you for employment if you submit a job application;
  * To allow your participation in activities, such as online discussion groups or chats, communities, and surveys;
  * To communicate with you through emails, text messages or phone calls about our and our affiliates’ products and services, targeted marketing materials, service updates, and promotional offers;
  * To customize, measure, deliver and improve our products, services, content, and advertising;
  * To recognize you when you log in and to authorize your instructions after you have logged in;
  * To personalize your overall experience with SanDisk; and
  * To transfer to our authorized third parties; and
  * Other uses as indicated with the information that is collected.



**Sharing personal information**

  * SanDisk is not in the business of selling your personal information to third parties. We may share your information if you consent. SanDisk may share certain personal information within the SanDisk companies. SanDisk may also share personal information with its authorized third parties (such as our vendors) who help with our business operations, including the storage and processing of personal data for the uses listed in this privacy statement. For California residents and other regions that require specific disclosure, we will not share your information with third parties for direct marketing without your consent.



If personal information is collected with your consent as part of a promotional event, we may share that information with our promotion partner(s). We may also share aggregated and non-personally identifiable information with our commercial customers or vendors for the purposes of improving their products or services.

  * We may need to disclose your personal information to comply with applicable laws, legal processes, government or quasi-governmental requests, or to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may disclose personal information and other information available to us when we believe, in our sole discretion, disclosure is necessary or appropriate in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the rights, property or physical safety of any person, violations of SanDisk’s terms of use or other agreements, potential threats to our or our employees’ rights, property or physical safety, or as otherwise required or permitted by law.
  * If SanDisk were to undergo a re-organization, merger or sale of all or a part of our assets, we may transfer personal and non-personal information as part of the transaction.



Please remember that any information you choose to disclose in public areas of SanDisk websites (such as within community forums through a chat feature or published in a product review) may become public information. You should exercise caution when disclosing information in public areas and should refrain from disclosing personal information.

**How to access and update your personal information**

We want to be sure the information we keep for you is up to date and accurate. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that any personal information is accurate, complete and up to date. You have the right under applicable data protection laws to access the personal information that SanDisk keeps for you, on request to SanDisk, except in certain limited circumstances (for example, where an applicable law requires us to deny such access).

**Security of personal information**

We appreciate your trust in sharing your personal information with us, and we are committed to protecting it. We utilize a combination of industry-standard security technologies, procedures and organizational measures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.

By way of example, access to your personal information is restricted to employees, contractors and agents of SanDisk who need to access such data to perform their assigned job duties. We may also store your personal information on limited-access computer systems which are located in controlled facilities. If we were to transmit your personal information over the Internet, we will protect the information using encryption such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

Despite our efforts to protect your personal information, there is an inherent risk of encountering unexpected security breach in any modern day computing environment. In the event of a security breach, if our investigations indicate that there could be significant harm to you as a result of such unauthorized access or disclosure of your personal information, we will promptly notify you and the proper authorities if required by law. We also encourage you to take precautions to protect your personal information when you are online. Create strong passwords by using a combination of letters and numbers, change passwords often, and use a secure browser.

**Data retention**

SanDisk will not retain your personal information longer than is necessary to honor your choices, fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, or as required by law. Your personal information will be destroyed or permanently de-identified in a secure manner when it is no longer needed. For example, when the information is printed on paper it may be deleted or destroyed by shredding or incineration; where the information is stored electronically, it may be deleted or made unavailable by technical means to render the information unusable.

**Links to other websites and social media platforms**

We may link to third-party websites or social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube, which are outside of our control and are not covered by this privacy statement. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of third-party websites or social media platforms. If you have questions about how these other websites use your information, you should review their policies or contact them directly. By allowing a link to a third-party site, we are not in any way endorsing, promoting or representing the quality of that site.

**Children and privacy**

Our site is not directed to minors, but is intended for a general audience comprised of adults. If you are a minor in your country of residence, you may use SanDisk websites and mobile software applications only with the involvement of your parent or guardian. SanDisk does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete the information.

We do not knowingly use, disclose, compile or allow third parties to use, disclose, or compile the personal information of California residents who are under the age of 18 for the purposes of marketing or advertising products or services to such children in violation of California law. Any California residents under the age of 18 who have registered to use this site and who post content or information on this site can request that such information be removed from the site by contacting us.

**Transfer of personal information, Safe Harbor**

We may transfer your personal information to SanDisk companies worldwide, or to authorized third parties worldwide acting on our behalf for the purposes of processing, storage or fulfillment. Your personal information may be transferred, stored and used at facilities located across the world and not necessarily in the country in which you are located.

**If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your personal information for use by SanDisk and its authorized third parties to the United States and other countries where the privacy laws may be less strict. By providing your personal information you consent to that transfer.**

SanDisk complies with the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from the European Union member countries and Switzerland. SanDisk has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement.
