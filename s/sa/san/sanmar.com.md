# SanMar : Privacy Policy

SanMar Corporation promises to protect the personal information given to us by visitors to our website and information included on our electronic mail lists. 

**COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION:  
**SanMar analyzes our website logs to constantly improve the value of our website to our visitors. This includes page views, unique views, unique visitors, repeat visitors, frequency of visits, and peak-volume traffic periods. In our use of this service, we do not gather, request, record, require, collect, or track any Internet users' personally identifiable information. 

**USE OF COOKIES:**  
Cookies are small data files that are downloaded onto your computer when you visit our site and that automatically identify your browser to our server whenever you interact with our site. We do link the cookies to your personally identifiable information on our servers, but no personal information is stored in the cookies themselves. We use cookies to track your use of our site, and to authenticate users when signing in. We do not share cookies with any other site. 

**DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION:**   
SanMar does not sell, rent, loan, trade, or lease personal information collected on our website or included on our e-mail lists to any third party. 

**DATA SECURITY:**   
We take precautions to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. 

**ENFORCEMENT:**   
If for any reason you believe that SanMar has not adhered to these privacy principles, please notify us by e-mail at [customertechsupport@sanmar.com](mailto:customertechsupport@sanmar.com), and we will endeavor to review and correct the problem promptly. Please use the words 'Privacy Policy' in the subject line. 

**EXTERNAL LINKS:**   
This website provides links to various websites that SanMar does not control. When you click on one of these links, you will be transferred out of our website and connected to the website of the organization or company that you selected. Even if an affiliation exists between our website and a third party website, we exercise no control over linked sites. Each of these linked sites maintains its own independent privacy and data collection practices and procedures. If you visit a website that is linked to our site, you should consult that site's privacy policy before providing any personal information. 

**INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION TRANSFERS:**  
Any personally identifiable information that you provide to SanMar will be collected directly on servers located in the United States and maintained on servers located in the United States. If you are located outside the United States, this means that any information you provide will be transferred abroad. While SanMar is committed to providing your information with the highest level of privacy protection, we believe you should know that the general level of protection for personal information in the United States may not be the same as that provided in other countries, including those that belong to the European Economic Area.
