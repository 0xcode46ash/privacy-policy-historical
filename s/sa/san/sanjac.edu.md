# Privacy Policy | San Jacinto College

San Jacinto College is committed to the highest level of integrity in dealing with the private information of our web users as part of our overall commitment to providing a quality web site and service experience for our users. This policy will continue to be assessed against new technologies, business practices and the needs of our users.

### Information Gathering

For systems administration and site statistical analysis, the San Jacinto College automatically logs IP addresses (the location of your computer on the Internet), time of visit, type of web browser being used, and operating system or platform. We do not use these logs to track your session or to identify your personal information except as specifically noted herein. We reserve the right in the future to provide personalization of content capabilities that may track a userâ€™s session with no additional notice

### Information Use

The San Jacinto College will not provide any of your personal information from the San Jacinto College website (the "Website") to third parties without your permission, unless compelled by law or court order to do so. We will not sell any personal information to third parties for purposes of marketing, advertising, or promotion. To protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer, it is important that you log off when you are finished visiting the Website and that you maintain your individual password information in a secure location. We may collect, analyze, and disclose to others aggregated information (which includes your specific information but only as an unidentifiable part of the aggregate) gathered from overall use of the Website or particular features or areas of the Website.

### Security

We utilize https 128-bit encryption technology to safeguard personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure and accidental loss, alteration or destruction. While no system can provide guaranteed security, we take reasonable efforts to keep information you provide to us secure, including physical security at the location of the server where information is stored.

### Links Outside Our Domain

Our web site contains links outside of our domain. The San Jacinto College is not responsible for the content or policies of those sites. San Jacinto College does not necessarily recommend or endorse the services or goods offered by any advertiser, linked site or third-party on the Website.

Each individual is responsible for reviewing the accuracy of the personal information of the Website and contacting the Registrar for student information or Human Resources for employee information in the event that it is believed that information is incorrect.

### Updated Privacy Statement

In the event of a change, a revised Privacy Statement will promptly be posted to our Web site. You agree to accept posting of a revised Privacy Statement electronically on the Web site as actual notice to you. You should review the Privacy Statement periodically to remain informed of any changes. Any dispute over our Privacy Statement is subject to this notice and our Terms and Conditions, including arbitration of disputes and limitation of damages.

### Disclosure and Use of Specific User Information

We may disclose specific information (such as identity and contact information) if we believe that such disclosure is necessary or desirable to: (i) fulfill legal or regulatory requirements, (ii) protect our rights or those of others, (iii) prevent or mitigate harm or damage of any kind or nature, (iv) address abusive practices related to use of the Website, or (v) address or seek redress for a violation of the Terms of Use or other obligations to us or other users.

### Contact

When you sign in to the Website, you may receive automatically-generated email instructions or notifications produced to assist in your use of the Website. From time to time, we may contact you about changes to the Website that may be of interest to you.

### Unauthorized Users

We strive to limit access to our database to bona fide users, student and faculty. However, no verification or security system is foolproof. Therefore, we are not responsible if someone impersonates a bona fide user to circumvent our security measures and gain access to the database, including your information, nor can we be responsible for any use, reproduction, or disclosure they may make of it.

### Passwords and Account Access

When you complete account registration, you will be asked to specify a password. Only you will know your password. You will also select a password hint. If you lose your password, you can call San Jacinto College and ask us to reset it to a temporary password. We will verify your identity by asking you your password hint. Upon successful answer, we will provide you with a temporary password. You can use this to access your account. It is strongly recommended that you change your password again at this time.

### Payments

Payments can be made through the Website. Payment information is encrypted using 128-bit https encryption techniques.

### Cookies

To improve your experience with the Website, "cookies" may be used. "Cookies" are elements of data sent from the Website to your computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. These devices improve efficiency by permitting the Website to retain information (like log in information) that it can then access on subsequent visits so the user doesn't have to input it again. They also permit the tracking of your movements on the Website, which we can then use to further enhance your online experience with us. In light of their benefits, most browsers accept cookies automatically. However, if you don't wish to accept cookies, you can set your browser to decline cookies.
