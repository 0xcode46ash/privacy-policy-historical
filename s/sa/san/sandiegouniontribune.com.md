California law governs the use of the U-T San Diego services and this Privacy Policy. Users of U-T San Diego consent to the jurisdiction and venue of an appropriate court or other tribunal in San Diego as the most convenient and appropriate forum for the resolution of disputes concerning this policy. U-T San Diego is controlled, operated and administered entirely within the United States. If you are located outside the United States, please note the information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States and that by accessing or using the U-T San Diego Services you are consenting to this transfer.

#### California Privacy Rights.

A California resident who has provided Personal Information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purpose is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed Personal Information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of Personal Information, upon receipt of a request by a user or customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed. However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business maintains and adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless (1) the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure or (2) the customer refrains from exercising an option that prevents the disclosure. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.

As stated in this Privacy Policy, U-T San Diego may share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you opt-out of receiving such information. Please note that whenever you opt-in to receive future communications from a third party or refrain from opting out from such sharing, your personal information may become subject to the third party's privacy policy and practices. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use personal information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.

If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices you may send an e-mail to customerservice@UTSanDiego.com or you may contact us by regular mail at: U-T San Diego, Attention: Customer Service, 350 Camino de la Reina, San Diego, California 92108.

All requests sent via postal mail must be labeled "Your California Privacy Rights" on the envelope or post card and clearly stated on the actual request. For all requests, please include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. (Your street address is optional if you wish to receive a response to your request via e-mail. Please include your zip code for our own record keeping.) U-T San Diego will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile. U-T San Diego is not responsible for notices that are not labeled or not sent properly or do not have complete information.

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please send an e-mail to customerservice@UTSanDiego.com, or you may contact us by regular mail at: U-T San Diego, Attention: General Counsel, 350 Camino de la Reina, San Diego, California 92108.
