Privacy

This statement informs you of Bay City’s practices with respect to the online collection, use, and disclosure of personal information from this Bay City Website. Personal information is information that allows us to contact you (such as email address, home address, or telephone number) or other information that, when linked to your name or contact information, allows us to personalize your visit to our site by providing you with information that suits your interests. Bay City is the owner of this website and retains all ownership rights to the information collected at this site. Bay City reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove provisions of this Privacy Statement. Any changes to this Privacy Statement will be posted here, and we encourage you to check back from time to time.

Personalization  
Although you may use many features of this site without completing a registration or sign-up form, visitors who do register and/or sign up for special services may have access to additional features of the site and are more likely to receive information suited to their interests. For example, a registered user is eligible for additional services provided by this website such as listener clubs and personalized content. Our registration and special services sign-up forms may ask you for contact information (like name or email address) and demographic information (like zip code or age). You must provide the information in order to receive the benefits of registration or of the special service.

We may use the contact information you give us to better tailor your website experience to your interests, and to send you information about Bay City and its services as well as promotional material on behalf of some of our partners. We use other information that you provide to us to show you content in which you may be interested and to display the content according to your preferences. We will also share this information within the Bay City family in order to enhance your experience on this and other Bay City Websites.

In addition, we may share this information with advertisers or other third parties that are not part of the Bay City family on an aggregate or other basis that does not disclose your identity or contact information.

Online Surveys/Contests  
From time to time, we may conduct online surveys and contests. These ask you for contact information (like name or email address) and demographic information (like zip code or age). We may use this contact information from our surveys and contests to provide you with information about our company and promotional material on behalf of some of our partners, and to contact you when necessary.

Supplemental Information  
To enhance Bay City’s ability to tailor this site to your preferences, we may combine information that you provide us on registration and other online sign-up forms with other information about you that we may obtain. We do not share that information with any other party.

Shopping/Commercial Services  
This Bay City site may offer shopping services, which may be offered by us or by a firm that operates a store under contract with us. If our site offers shopping or other commercial services, you will use a customer order form to request information, products, and services. The order form will ask you to give us contact information (like name or email address), financial information (like account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (like zip code or age).

We will use the financial information that you provide to bill you for products and services. By giving our site your credit card and related personal information, you are authorizing our store to give that information to the merchant and credit card company in order to confirm and fulfill your order.

We will use contact information from the order form to fulfill your orders. We may also use contact data to get in touch with you when necessary. We will not otherwise use or distribute your financial information without your prior approval.

Public Forums  
This site may make available chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups. Please remember that any information that you disclose in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

Information Sharing With Third Parties  
From time to time we may enter into a special relationship with another company that is not owned by Bay City to provide additional features at this site. These special relationships may include “powered by” partners, business partners, sponsors, and co-branded sites (referred to here as “co-branded pages”). These might include, for example, pages that share our name and that of another entity, such as TicketMaster. You should look for a specific privacy statement on any such co-branded page. Any personal information that you provide when signing up at one of those co-branded pages may be shared with our third party partner. You should also check our partner’s website for information regarding its privacy policies.

Also, the nature of some features of our site may require that we share personal information about you with persons or companies outside of the Bay City family. For example, this may occur at a feature that enables you, via our site, to ask questions of persons or entities that are not part of the Bay City family. By responding to those features of the site, whether by email or direct entry of information on our Website, you are consenting to our transferring that information to such persons or entities.

With respect to specific registration modules, like contests, we may disclose personal information collected, and we will post a conspicuous statement on the registration module to the effect that we will be disclosing the information collected with third parties

Finally, we may share any of the information collected from you with these other non-Bay City companies in an aggregate basis. The aggregated information is not linked to any information that can identify you.

IP Address and Log Files  
We may use your IP address to administer our Website, to help diagnose problems with our server, to analyze trends, to track users’ webpage movements, to help identify you and your shopping cart, and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

Cookies  
This Bay City site may use a standard technology called a “cookie” to collect information about how you use the site. Cookies reside on your computer and help our website to recognize your computer’s browser as a previous visitor. This information allows us to customize delivery of information. For example, our site may use cookies to save and remember registration information or preferences that you may have set while browsing the site, to keep track of your shopping cart, to ensure you don’t see the same ad content repeatedly, to deliver content specific to your interests, and to save your password so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. We use cookies only to gather information as indicated in this policy. In addition, on occasion our site may also set a “session cookie” which helps us administer the site. The session cookie expires when you close your browser and does not retain any information about you after it expires.

Finally, we may also use an ad network provider to help present advertisements on this and other Bay City Web sites. This ad network provider, like other advertising service vendors, uses cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on the hard drive of your computer to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other sites you have visited, and to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. In doing so, the provider collects non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other clickstream data. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by these ad network providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours. If you do not want the benefits of these advertising cookies, you may opt-out by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp. However, if you do so you may not receive the full benefit from the use of our site.

Banner Advertising  
We license ad-server software from another company to place banner advertising on our sites. All of the data provided and generated by the ad-server software remains in our possession and no data is transferred to the licensor of the software. This feature of our site may, on occasion, set “cookies” on your computer. Any information collected or stored by the ad-service or the cookies is treated in the same manner as other information as described in this statement. Children’s Personal Information  
Consistent with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act:

• This site does NOT collect, use, or disclose personal information (including online contact information) of children under the age of 13.

• In the event that a child under the age of 13 attempts to register on our site, we will NOT accept the registration and will delete information received from the child.

• In the event that a child posts personal information in a public forum such as a chat room, we will attempt to delete that information once we become aware of it.

Your Choices  
This Bay City site provides you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving email communications from us and our special relationship partners. To opt-out of receiving email communications, you may:

• Modify your registered user information on our website at www.sandiego6.com/enews/signup

Access to Personal Information  
Bay City gives you the opportunity to modify or remove personal information that you have provided to us. You may do so by modifying your password-protected registered user information on our website.

Security of Your Personal Information  
Bay City employs reasonable security measures consistent with standard industry practice, for information collected through this website. We believe that we have adequate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information we collect on our website. We also use internal protections to limit access to users’ personal information to only those employees who need the information to perform a specific job.

Sale or Merger  
If this site is sold to, or merges with, another company not owned by Bay City, you should expect that some or all of the information collected from this website may be transferred to the buyer/surviving company. If so, Bay City will seek to obligate the acquiring company to use any personal information transferred by this site in a manner consistent with this statement, but cannot guarantee that it will be able to impose that requirement or that the acquiring company will comply.

Legal Process  
You should be aware that Bay City may be required to disclose your personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, such as in court or regulatory proceedings.

This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference in the Site’s Terms of Use Agreement, which is binding on all Site users.

Residents of the State of California that have an established business relationship with a company that conducts business in California, under a provision of the California Civil Code, have the right to request from that company a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information about the resident during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an Opt-out or Opt-in choice for use of Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or certain affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.

This Station qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive privacy policy and provides you with details on how you may Opt-out or Opt-in to the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes during the preceding year.

It is also necessary that we share your Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information with our operational service providers, the specialists that provide internal support to Station operations and activities and/or for Site design, development, hosting and operations including maintenance, management, storage and/or fulfillment of our membership and e-mail clubs, various contests, sweepstakes, services, events and online stores. We use operational service providers to efficiently provide the full range of content, activities and membership services we bring to you and we request that our operational service providers also protect your privacy and not disclose your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information to third party marketers that are not associated with the Station or Site. Additionally, such providers are not to use your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information for their own marketing or promotional purposes.

In the event that the assets or stock of the Station, its corporate licensee or parent company(s) are sold or transferred, merged with a different company or entity, restructured, or subject to other fundamental corporate changes, we reserve the right to disclose any and all databases compiled from Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information collected by the Station to such successor. We will seek to obligate the Station’s successor to agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy, as it may hereafter be modified, but cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so or that the successor company will comply with this obligation.

We reserve the right to collect Personal Information using any new technology yet to be developed and to use such technology to provide new services and features to you, as well as for marketing and promotional purposes. Specific information regarding your choice to Opt-in or to Opt-out to such use, or for sharing your Personal Information with advertisers, will be provided once the new technology, service, or feature is introduced.

WEBSITE COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

Generally, you may browse this Site, and watch clips of our programs, without providing any Personal Information. For certain activities (which may include, but is not limited to, contest and sweepstakes registrations, membership, viewer clubs, surveys and news/sports/weather alerts) the Personal Information you voluntarily provide may include your first/middle and last name, home address, business address, email address, telephone number, mobile phone/text messaging device number, birth date, gender, employer or personal preferences, depending on the activity.

Unless stated otherwise, we do not request contact information for a mobile phone, text messaging or any wireless device that includes a domain name address (such as “.net” or “.com”) as part of the contact information. Federal law prohibits the sending of commercial email messages directly to a wireless device that uses a domain name, unless you have first given your affirmative consent. We may inadvertently collect a wireless device number that includes a domain name when you send us an inquiry or register for a contest or membership club. However, we will not knowingly use that contact information for sending commercial email. We reserve the right to respond to user inquiries or requests sent via a wireless device that uses a domain name as such messages are not deemed to be commercial email and therefore, are not regulated by Federal law. However, when “computer to phone” commercial emails are prohibited by law, we may reject your wireless device contact information when such information is submitted for certain Site features or services. We will attempt to notify you if we will need new contact information.

For specific purposes (such as the purchase of goods and services) we may request a type of confidential personally identifiable information which shall be called “Sensitive Personal Information” and is defined as any individual’s: (1) social security number; (2) driver’s license number or state identification card number; (3) account number, credit or debit card number, with or without any required security code, access code or password that would permit access to an individual’s financial account; (4) mother’s maiden name; (5) passport number; or (6) electronic or digitized signature. Sensitive Personal Information will only be used to implement the specific activity or event it was submitted for. We will not share your Sensitive Personal Information with advertisers.

However, more general Personal Information will be used to implement the specific activity or event and will also be used for the marketing of additional events, services and merchandising for this Site and the Station.

DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

Advertising support allows us to offer, free of charge, many great activities and services to our users such as contests, membership clubs, sweepstakes and special events. However, we do not currently share Personal Information with our advertisers. However, depending on the activity, we may in the future do so and you will receive notice on the Site and/or in the rules of participation (“Rules of Participation”) for the event or activity, or via an email notice. Please be informed that our advertisers may not have the same privacy policies that we do. Therefore, you will need to tell us if you do not want to receive marketing information directly from our advertisers. You will need to check the “Opt-out” click boxes that may be included in the registration area for the particular event, in an email, or alternatively, notify the Site’s Privacy Administrator at privacy@sandiego6.com. You will also need to tell us if you do not wish to receive marketing or promotional materials from the Site and/or Station in the same manner.

We also provide you with an option to “Opt-out” of receiving advertising and promotional email from us in compliance with federal law by installing an Opt-out mechanism with all such email messages. You must use the designated method in the email message to notify us of your Opt-out request, as we cannot guarantee that other methods of notification will be effective or timely. Please be aware that we may continue to contact you via email for administrative or informational purposes, including follow-up messages regarding contests you have entered or other transactions you have undertaken. By law, such messages are not considered to be commercial email.

We are not responsible for removing your Personal Information from third party lists or entities which you have previously authorized us to share your information. You will need to contact those entities directly.

COOKIES AND IMAGE TAGS

The use of cookies is an industry standard and they are currently used on most websites, including this Site. Cookies are a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a website to the hard drive of a user’s computer so that the website administrator or a third party operational service provider may identify the computer and passively track the user’s activities on the website. Image tags work in conjunction with cookies and are small image files that may be located on select pages of our Site, or within web-based email newsletters that we may send. (Image tags are also called web beacons, web bugs, clear GIFs or single-pixel GIFs.). Tracking is important because we can better understand which parts of our website are used the most, when to launch new services and how to enhance current offerings. We may share the information we receive from cookies and image tags with third-parties and our advertisers in aggregate form, which means that such information does not contain specific Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information about any one visitor.

In short, cookies and image tags collect a user’s Internet protocols and server information. Such data files will allow our Site to remember your web browser when you visit our Site and will allow for quick and efficient access to our many services. A cookie will not allow the Site to learn any Personal Information (such as your real name and email address) or Sensitive Personal Information that you have not otherwise disclosed. Cookies and image tags allow the Site to remember important information that will make the Site easier for you to use and helpful in our administration of various activities. We do not use cookies or image tags to collect other Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information unless you give us permission to do so.

You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie or image tag is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all such devices. This is done through your browser. If you turn cookies off, you may not then have access to many features at our Site that make your Internet experience more efficient and enjoyable – like the features mentioned above – and some of our other services will not function properly.

CHILDREN’S PRIVACY POLICY

Although persons of all ages may visit our Site and participate in activities that do not require the collection of Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information, we do not knowingly or intentionally collect Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information from children under the age of 13. Except for the limited circumstances listed below, we will automatically reject and delete the registration or entry of any person we believe in good faith to be underage. Any false or fraudulent registration or entry from a minor will be deemed to be ineligible and will disqualify the minor from the receipt of a prize, benefit, or other participation.

Except to meet Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), or other regulatory and legal purposes, we will not use, store, or disclose any child’s Personal Information to a third party without prior parental consent.

EMAIL

Any communications or materials sent to the Station or Site by any user via email or otherwise, including any comments, data, questions, suggestions or the like, will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary. You agree that any use of such material does not violate any rights including, but not limited to, privacy rights, proprietary or other property rights, publicity rights, rights to credit for material or ideas, including the right to approve the way the Station uses such material. Any material submitted to us or the Site may be adapted, broadcast, changed, copied, disclosed, licensed, performed, posted, published, sold or transmitted by the Station anywhere in the world, through any medium now known or later devised.

We do not generally keep email correspondence sent to the Site. Please do not place any Sensitive Personal Information in your email correspondence to the Station that pertains to station programming or operations.

SHOPPING & E-COMMERCE

If this Site sells goods and/or services we will request Sensitive Personal Information that includes your credit card, debit card or other payment information. Alternatively, the Site may use a third party operational service provider to conduct the financial transaction in a secured manner; the third party payment will be accessible via a hyperlink from the Site and will be solely responsible for all financial transactions and the collection, use, and storage of your Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information. We may request additional Personal Information such as full name, billing and shipping address, email address and telephone number and any such information that is required to fulfill your order and to communicate with you regarding your order. Sensitive Personal Information will be encrypted or collected though a secured Internet connection generally via SSL or S-HTTP protocols. Such Sensitive Personal Information will also be stored in a commercially reasonable secure manner. We may use your Personal Information, (but not your credit card or debit card number) to contact you about future products, services and discounts from the Station unless you tell us otherwise (“Opt-out”). We will only use your credit card and debit card number to complete the specific transaction you requested.

CHAT ROOMS, MESSAGE BOARDS AND PUBLIC AREAS

For your enjoyment and entertainment, this Site may choose to offer user interactive activities such as chat rooms, message boards, and/or public forums (“Public Areas”). We will not share any Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information that is entered into the Public Area registration section on the Site with advertisers.

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to save and archive any content of any nature posted to the Site and that we may, without liability to any user: 1) disclose such content if required to do so by law or to comply with legal processes; 2) to respond to claims that any of the content violates the property, privacy, publicity or other rights of others; or 3) to protect the rights, property or safety of the Site, the Station, its employees, users and members of the public.

MONITORING AND USE OF AGGREGATE PERSONAL INFORMATION

We reserve the right to monitor and edit any Personal Information about our users, including information about the use of website activities and services, the contents of users’ email and messages for internal purposes, and when necessary, to disclose to law enforcement personnel, and/or the employer and/or Internet Service Provider of a user that is not in compliance with the Terms of Use Agreement or Privacy Policy. We will take such measures if we believe it is necessary to protect the security, integrity, and operations of this Site or Station. Without disclosure of Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information about individual users, we may provide aggregate statistics about our users, traffic patterns and related website information to advertisers, reputable third party vendors or marketing companies.

ADVERTISING AND OTHER THIRD PARTY CONTENT

This Privacy Policy does not cover third party advertising or third party content that may be present on the Site. This Site may provide banner and general advertising, in addition to other content provided by our advertisers or operational service providers. Users may from time to time purchase goods or services offered through, or otherwise participate in or send messages concerning such advertising, promotions or third party content offered through the Site. Such correspondence, transactions and agreements are solely between the user and the Advertiser or the third party content provider and do not involve the Site. Also, advertisers and such third party content providers may not have the same privacy policies that we do and you are encouraged to read their privacy policy first.

PHISHING

Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers’ personal identity data and financial account credentials. “Phishers” use ‘spoofed’ e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into divulging Sensitive Personal Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords and social security numbers. We will NEVER send an email asking you to provide or confirm Sensitive Personal Information. If you receive a communication such as this, please immediately forward it to the Site’s Privacy Administrator at privacy@sandiego6.com, and immediately delete it from your computer.

HYPERLINKS TO, AND FRAMING OF, OTHER WEBSITES

This Site often provides links to third party websites that could be of interest to our users, including the websites of our advertisers. As stated in our Terms of Use Agreement, the Station does not own or control these websites and therefore, is not responsible for the content, business practices, or operations of such websites. Third party websites linked or framed on this Site may have different privacy policies and business practices than we do. The presence of a link to a third party website does not constitute or imply our endorsement, recommendation, or sponsorship of the third party content, goods, or services available through, or contained on, the Site. By use of this Site, you have agreed that you will use the hyperlinks to third party sites at your own risk.

OFF-LINE COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

The Station also collects and uses Personal Information by other means, via on-air broadcasts, telephone, direct mail, and direct communications from members of the public. The various uses of such Personal Information may include, but are not limited to, contests and sweepstakes, loyal viewer club registration, other special membership only features/events, news tip lines, job applications, viewer complaints, and operational and business purposes.  
Except for contests and sweepstakes entries, or registrations for a loyal viewer or other special membership features/events, we do not ordinarily use your Personal Information collected off-line for promotional or advertising purposes, nor do we share it with third parties for promotional or marketing purposes. If Personal Information collected off-line will be used by the Station, its parent company(s), or corporate affiliates for promotional and marketing purposes, you have the opportunity to Opt-out of such use.

SECURITY MEASURES

We conduct the collection, management, maintenance and storage of viewer or website user information in a secure and commercially reasonable manner using acceptable industry standards of security technology and practices (such as electronic security systems and password protections) to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of Personal Information. We also request that our operational service providers take such precautions. The Station’s databases are accessible only by authorized personnel.

However, please note that when users transmit Personal Information over an unsecured Internet connection, the Site is not responsible for the security of that information during the transmission stage as your email or registration could be copied or intercepted by unknown third parties. We use a secured connection only for the collection of Sensitive Personal Information, which is necessary for the purchase of goods or services, but we do not use a secured connection for other types of activities. Therefore, you understand, acknowledge, and agree that you transmit certain Personal Information to this Site at your own risk.

REVIEW, UPDATE, CORRECT, OR DELETE PERSONAL INFORMATION OR SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION

Generally, you may review, update or delete your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information collected by the Site. You may also correct factual inaccuracies. Certain types of Personal Information that are necessary to check eligibility, such as birth date or age, cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the new information. Note that we reserve the right to terminate or delete any membership or entry if we believe the Personal Information submitted was knowingly false or fraudulent.

To review, update or delete your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information collected by the Site, please email the Site’s Privacy Administrator at privacy@sandiego6.com or click here. To have access to your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information, you must provide proof of identification such as full name, street address, city/state and zip code, user ID and password, and/or information about your recent activity on the website. We reserve the right to deny access to any user if we believe there is a question about your identity. And if the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such information. In such cases, we will provide to you with an explanation of why access cannot be provided and a contact person for further inquiries.

This Privacy Policy was last updated on January 25, 2012 and is effective immediately.
