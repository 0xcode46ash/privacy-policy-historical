Privacy Policy 

The Sacred Destinations website does not collect any personally-identifiable information from visitors. No part of the site requires you to register or log in, and we don't use cookies.

Like all websites, our web server logs track basic information about our visitors, such as how many people visited Sacred Destinations, how long they stayed, what country they're from, and what site they came from to get to ours. None of this information tells us who you are.

If you give us personal information, such as your e-mail address when writing us, we won't disclose this information to anyone else nor use it to send you sales pitches.

This privacy policy covers www.sacred-destinations.com only. Other sites we link to have their own privacy policies.
