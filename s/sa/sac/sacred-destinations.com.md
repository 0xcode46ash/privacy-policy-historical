# Privacy Policy

The Sacred Destinations website does not collect any personally-identifiable information from visitors. No part of the site requires you to register or log in, and we don't use cookies.

Like all websites, our web server logs track basic information about our visitors, such as how many people visited the website, how long they stayed, what country they're from, and what site they came from to get to ours. None of this information tells us who you are.

If you give us personal information, for example your e-mail address when writing us, we won't disclose this information to anyone else nor add it to any mailing list. 

We use Google's advertising technology to serve relevant ads when you visit our website. Google uses cookies to gather general data (which _does not include_ any personal information like your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements for goods and services that are likely to be of interest to you. You can learn more and opt out of this cookie by visiting the [Google Advertising and Privacy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html) page. 

This privacy policy covers www.sacred-destinations.com only. Other sites we link to have their own privacy policies.
