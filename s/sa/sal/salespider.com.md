1\. _Cookies_ : Like many website operators, we use “cookies” to recognize your web browser.  A “cookie” is a small piece of information that is stored in a designated file on your computer.  Each cookie has a unique number with no meaning outside of the Website.  Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information about our visitors.  
We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  Session ID cookies terminate when you close your browser.  Persistent cookies may be stored on a hard drive for an extended period of time.  Persistent cookies can be removed by following directions found under “help” in your internet browser.  You can configure your browser not to accept cookies however, if you do so, you may not be able to use certain optional features or functions of Salespider.com.   
2. _Log Files_ :  Like many website operators, we use tracking programs that collect information about log files, including Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, internet service providers (ISPs), referring/exit pages, platform types, date/time stamps and number of clicks.  The information that we collect regarding log files is not linked to personally identifying information.  
3. _Web Beacons/Web Bugs (Clear GIFs/ Single-Pixel GIFs)_ : Advertisements that appear on our website are sometimes delivered by third party advertisers.  These third party advertisers may use web beacons or web bugs to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked.  No personally identifying information is gathered through web beacons or web bugs.

2. _How do we use your email address?_ :  If you choose to provide us with your email address, we may email you from time to time to call your attention to products and offers we believe might interest you.  In addition, other registered users with Salespider.com and the Sales Spider Network will have the ability to email you to make offers and correspond with you, although all such emails will be transmitted through our servers and not directly from such users (unless you specifically provide your email address to any particular user(s)).  
3. _Can you opt out of receiving emails?_ :  If you prefer not to receive direct communications sent by us, our advertisers or other third parties, you will be given an opportunity to decline at the time you provide any information.  If you decline at the time you provide us with information or choose to opt out later, you will not receive email or other communications sent directly by us or our advertisers utilizing information collected from Salespider.com. However, if you provide your personal information as part of your User Profile and you elect to receive notifications when other users communicate with you, you will continue to receive emails from other users.  Those emails are transmitted via our servers so they will still retain the Sales Spider designation, even though they are sent by other users and not by us.
