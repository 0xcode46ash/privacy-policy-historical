PRIVACY POLICY  
  
Sally Foster respects your privacy. When you use our Web site, we will collect certain information in order to make shopping on-line possible and provide you with other services. This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") describes the information we collect online, and the manner in which we may use such information. 

COLLECTION OF INFORMATION:  
  
When you request certain services using our Web site, such as ordering Sally Foster products on-line, we will ask you to provide certain information about yourself. This information may include name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, and credit card number. This information is necessary to your receiving and/or being billed for services you request (e.g., name, address and credit card information when ordering products), and you will not be able to use such services without providing this information. 

When you visit our Web site, we will automatically collect information regarding your use. Currently, this is done using "Cookies" - small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive and relayed back to our servers. We use both Session and Persistent Cookies. Session Cookies track your progression through our Web site in a single visit and are deleted as soon as you close your browser. Persistent Cookies enable such functions as tracking items you place in your shopping cart. Persistent Cookies remain on your computer until you erase them. 

USE AND DISCLOSURE INFORMATION:  
  
We use the information we collect from you in order to provide you with services and billing as well as for collection purposes. We may use this information to improve our marketing efforts and services, analyze site usage and to customize our Web site's content and layout. We also may use this information to notify you of special offers, discounts, and new products and services via email and other on and off-line communications. If you do not want to receive these communications from us, please notify us by email at asksally@sallyfoster.com identifying the subject of the email as "Privacy". 

We may collect, create and disclose to third parties aggregate anonymous statistics regarding our customers, sales, traffic analyses and other information regarding or collected through our Web site. Other than in this anonymous form, we will not disclose your personal information without first obtaining your permission except as follows: 

We may disclose personal information if required by law or legal process, or if we believe it is necessary to do so to protect the property and personal safety of us, visitors to our Web site and other third parties. 

We may disclose your personal information to third parties providing, or assisting us in providing, services requested by you, and for billing and collection purposes. 

In the unlikely event that substantially all of the assets of Sally Foster, Inc., or its parent Entertainment Publications, Inc., are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 

By using our Web site, and providing us with information, you are consenting to our collection and the above uses of your information. You may also request to have all of your personal information collected by us removed from our database by sending a message to the following email address: asksally@sallyfoster.com, identifying the subject of the email as "Privacy", and, unless we are prohibited by law, we will remove such information within a 3-month period. 

SECURITY:  
  
We process customer orders and collect and store personally identifiable information using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. SSL encrypts the information you input before it is sent to us via the Internet. In addition, all of the customer information we collect on our Web site is secured against unauthorized access on the Sally Foster server. 

FEEDBACK:  
  
We appreciate your comments and questions regarding this Privacy Policy. If at any time you believe we have violated this Privacy Policy or any of your personal information maintained by us is inaccurate, please notify us by email at asksally@sallyfoster.com, and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to investigate and, if we deem necessary, correct such violation or inaccuracy. 

NOTICE OF CHANGE:  
  
We may modify or supplement this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will post the changes on this page, prior to the change taking effect, by showing the change(s) in bold font. This Privacy Policy will be effective as of April 1, 2005.
