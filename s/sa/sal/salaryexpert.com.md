                                           Privacy Policy
                                   Last Updated: December 2003
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) tells you about the information Baker, Thomsen Associates
Insurance Services, Inc. (“BTA”) collects through the services available on the BTA family of
websites: www.btabta.com, www.salaryexpert.com, and www.benefitsreview.com (collectively
the "Site", including SalaryExpert Pro, ePro, and various country specific versions), how BTA
uses that information, and how you (the end-user) can opt out of certain uses of information that
BTA may collect. By using BTA's services and accessing the Site, you are consenting to the
information collection and use practices described in this Policy, as modified from time to time
by BTA. Should BTA decide to change the Policy, BTA will post a new policy on the Site and
change the date at the top of the new policy. BTA encourages you to check the date of the
Policy whenever you visit the Site for any updates or changes. Please see BTA's Terms of Use
for a more detailed legal explanation of BTA's general online policies. If you have any
questions about the Policy or BTA's use of your information, please e-mail BTA at
info@btabta.com, or call us at 1.877.799.3427.
Information About You
BTA collects several types of information on the Site. BTA collects "Personal Information,"
which generally speaking, is information that can be used to identify you individually, such as
your name and address. BTA also collects "Demographic Information", which is information
about you that does not itself identify you individually. Examples of Demographic Information
include your geographic location and industry sector. BTA also collects
“ClickstreamInformation", which is information about the use of the Site, such as the Web pages
visited most often. The information BTA collects depends on what services you use on the Site.
The following provides a more detailed explanation of these types of information as well as
when and how BTA collects and uses the information. Additionally, BTA collects information
that contributes to the enhancement of the abandoned U.S. Dictionary of Occupational Titles.
This data is contributed to the eDOT Project, an independent effort to update work measures
and to www.salariesreview.com site, an online interactive salary survey. (In exchange for these
contributions, SalaryExpert gains access to these two organizations' databases for enriching of
its reported data.)
                                       Personal Information
Subscriber and Transactional Information: When you access BTA's SalaryExpert.com

Use of Your Personal Information.
Except as expressly disclosed within this Policy, BTA neither sells nor discloses information that

without the consent of the Site's users. BTA may use, sell, disclose, or otherwise dispose of
Personal Information that BTA collects in the following circumstances:
· Subscription Delivery: BTA will use your mailing address to send to you the subscriptions
  that you have ordered, and your e-mail address to contact you about renewing your


  subscription.
· Internal Analysis and Promotions. BTA may use information about you for BTA's internal
  statistical, design, operational purposes such as to estimate the Site's audience size; measure
  aggregate traffic patterns; and understand demographics, customer interest, purchasing and
  other trends among the Site's guests and BTA's subscribers. BTA may also use your Personal
  Information to market and/or promote BTA's products and services, such as sending you
  product updates. If you do not want to receive BTA's promotional materials, you may choose
  to opt out of future mailings by sending a message to: optout@btabta.com.
· Affiliates. If you order a subscription through a link on an affiliate Web site, BTA may share
  with that affiliate either your name or your company name, the amount of your purchase, and
  the time you made the purchase. BTA does not provide affiliates with any of your contact
  information.
· Transaction Processing. BTA may share your Personal Information and transactional
  information with entities as is necessary to process credit card payments or other purchasing
  or delivery systems.
· Legal Requirement. BTA may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in
  the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform with the law, respond to
  claims and complaints, or comply with legal process served on BTA or the Site; (b) protect
  and defend BTA's rights or property, the Site, BTA's employees, guests or the public.

                                       Aggregate Information
Clickstream and Demographic Information
BTA may collect Clickstream Information about you and your use of our Site whenever you visit
the Site. For instance, we may collect information such as entry and exit points for the Site (i.e.
referring URLs or domains), Site traffic statistics, page views, impressions, and operating
system and browser type. In addition, when users request Web pages on the Site, BTA's
servers automatically log the IP address of each user. An IP address is a number that is
automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the World Wide Web.
Clickstream Information and Demographic Information may be aggregated for usage, sales and
marketing purposes (“Aggregate Information”). When BTA aggregates such information, BTA
compiles the information in a manner that describes the purchases or characteristics of users of
the Site generally but does not individually identify any specific user, activity or transaction. BTA
may also use third-party software that tracks traffic directed to the Site from affiliate Web sites
and the purchases that result from this traffic. This information is similarly aggregated and is not
tied to an individual purchase.
BTA may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any
and all Aggregate Information. Should BTA share such information with other companies, it is
not traceable to any particular user, and will not be used to contact you. Should BTA correlate
any Aggregate Information to you, such information will be treated like any other Personal
Information under this policy. In rare circumstances, BTA may use such information to identify a
user when necessary to enforce compliance with an agreement between BTA and the user, to
comply with law enforcement requests, or to protect BTA's Site(s) or other users.
Cookies
BTA may make use of "cookies" on the Site. Cookies are small text files stored on a user's


computer by a Web server based on the permissions set in a user's browser software. A cookie
itself is neither designed nor intended to read any information from a user's computer (other
than the contents of the cookie); rather, it is an identifier used by the Web sites that originally
placed it on your hard drive. The actual contents of the cookie information can be retrieved by
the same server to identify the computer and subsequently to customize, monitor, or regulate
the use of a Web's sites based on information stored on the host server. Therefore, cookies
only identify the user's computer to the Web sites, which may correlate other information,
including personally identifying information, with the cookie.
BTA's utilizes cookies in order to automate access and data entry functions of the Site such as
correlating online ordering information, tailoring the Site to your preferences or interests, or
customizing promotions or marketing. In addition, cookies allow BTA to track use of the Site to
determine those areas that are useful or popular and those that are not, thereby enabling BTA
to improve and update the Site.
You may adjust your Web browsers in order to: (a) alert you of the use of cookies, or (b) allow
you to refuse to accept cookies entirely. For Internet Explorer or AOL users, you can click on
the "Start" button and then select Control Panel, Internet Options and the Security tab. If you
click on the "Custom" button, you will be able to see the cookie options. For Netscape users, in
the browser, select File, Preferences and then Advanced to view the cookie options. If you
disable cookies, certain functions on the Site may not function properly.
Links to Other Sites
Please be aware that BTA provides links to third-party Web sites as a service to guests, and
BTA is not responsible for the content or information collection practices of these third-party
Web sites. Please note that these third-party Web sites' privacy policies may differ from those of
BTA. BTA encourages you to review and understand the privacy practices associated with each
third-party Web site before providing any third-party Web site with information.
Children
The Site is intended for the use of a general audience. The Site is neither designed nor
intended to collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. To respect the
privacy of children and to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, children
under the age of 13 should not provide any Personal Information on the Site. We ask that
parents supervise their children while their children access the Internet.
Security
BTA uses commercially reasonable efforts to store and maintain Personal Information to protect
it from loss, misuse, alternation or destruction by any unauthorized party. For example, BTA
encrypts order information, including credit card numbers, using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
technology in order to protect customers' information as it is sent over the Internet to BTA's
server.

BTA's system, please send your request to info@btabta.com.
