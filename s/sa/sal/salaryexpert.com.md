Information About You. PAQ collects several types of information on our Site. PAQ collects "Personal
Information," which, generally speaking, is information that can be used to identify you individually, such as your
name and address. PAQ also collects "Demographic Information," which is information about you that does not
itself identify you individually. Examples of Demographic Information include your geographic location and
industry sector as well as information about the type of work performed including any 3 of 99 eDOT Skills Project
work measures, earnings, skills, and primary tasks. PAQ also collects "Clickstream Information," which is
information about the use of the Site, such as the Web pages visited most often. The information PAQ collects
depends on what services you use on the Site. The following provides a more detailed explanation of these types
of information as well as when and how PAQ collects and uses the information.
Personal Information and Transactional Information. When you access the Site, PAQ may collect various

personally when you submit comments, questions or suggestions, or when you request technical support.
Use of Your Personal Information. Except as expressly disclosed within this Policy, PAQ neither sells nor
discloses information that identifies PAQ's guests personally or makes it possible for other parties to contact them
directly without the consent of the Site's users. PAQ may use, sell, disclose, or otherwise dispose of Personal
Information that PAQ collects in the following circumstances:
      •    Subscription Delivery. PAQ may use your mailing address to send to you any subscriptions or reports
           that you have ordered and may use your e-mail address to contact you regarding additional
           subscriptions, reports, or services offered by PAQ or PAQ's affiliated corporations.
      •    Internal Analyses, Promotions and Databases. PAQ may use information about you for PAQ's
           internal statistical, design, operational purposes such as to estimate the Site's audience size; measure
           aggregate traffic patterns; and understand demographics, customer interest, purchasing and other
           trends among the Site's guests and PAQ's subscribers. PAQ may also use your Personal Information to
           market and/or promote PAQ's products and services, such as sending you product updates. Further,
           PAQ may use information about you such as your industry, job title and compensation, in order to

          living information. As mentioned above, PAQ's Terms of Use governs your use of the Site and, per the
          terms, PAQ claims the exclusive right to any and all submissions made by you to PAQ via the Site.
          PAQ's Terms of Use are accessible from the bottom portion of the Site home page: www.PAQ.com.
     •    Affiliates. If you order a subscription through a link on an affiliate Web site, PAQ may share with that
          affiliate either your name or your organization name, the amount of your purchase, and the time you
          made the purchase.
     •    Transaction Processing. PAQ may share your Personal Information and transactional information with
          entities as is necessary to process credit card payments or other purchasing or delivery systems.
     •    Legal Requirement. PAQ may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good-
          faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform with the law, respond to claims and complaints,
          or comply with legal process served on PAQ or the Site; or (b) protect and defend PAQ's rights or
          property, the Site, PAQ's employees, guests or the public.
     •    Company Sale. Information collected through the Site is considered a trade secret of PAQ. As the
          owner of such information, PAQ may disclose or sell such information as an asset of PAQ in conjunction
          with the sale to a third party of PAQ or a portion of PAQ's assets.
Aggregate Information:
Clickstream and Demographic Information. PAQ may collect Clickstream Information about you and your use
of our Site whenever you visit the Site. For instance, we may collect information such as entry and exit points for
the Site (i.e., referring URLs or domains), Site traffic statistics, page views, impressions, and operating system
and browser type. In addition, when users request Web pages on the Site, PAQ's servers automatically log the IP
address of each user. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you
access the World Wide Web.
Clickstream Information and Demographic Information may be aggregated for usage, sales and marketing
purposes ("Aggregate Information"). When PAQ aggregates such information, PAQ compiles the information in a
manner that describes the purchases or characteristics of users of the Site generally but does not individually
identify any specific user, activity or transaction. PAQ may also use third-party software that tracks traffic directed
to the Site from affiliate Web sites and the purchases that result from this traffic. This information is similarly
aggregated and is not tied to an individual purchase.
PAQ may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and all
Aggregate Information. Should PAQ share such information with other companies, it is not traceable to any
particular user, and will not be used to contact you. Should PAQ correlate any Aggregate Information to you,
such information will be treated like any other Personal Information under this policy. In rare circumstances, PAQ
may use such information to identify a user when necessary to enforce compliance with an agreement between
PAQ and the user, to comply with law enforcement requests, or to protect PAQ's Site(s) or other users.
Cookies. PAQ may make use of "cookies" on the Site. Cookies are small text files stored on a user's computer
by a Web server based on the permissions set in a user's browser software. A cookie itself is neither designed
nor intended to read any information from a user's computer (other than the contents of the cookie); rather, it is
an identifier used by the Web sites that originally placed it on your hard drive. The actual contents of the cookie
information can be retrieved by the same server to identify the computer and subsequently to customize, monitor,
or regulate the use of a Web site based on information stored on the host server. Therefore, cookies only identify
the user's computer to the Web sites, which may correlate other information, including personally identifying
information, with the cookie.
PAQ utilizes cookies in order to automate access and data entry functions of the Site such as correlating online
ordering information, tailoring the Site to your preferences or interests, or customizing promotions or marketing.
In addition, cookies allow PAQ to track use of the Site to determine those areas that are useful or popular and
those that are not, thereby enabling PAQ to improve and update the Site.
You may adjust your Web browsers in order to: (a) alert you regarding the use of cookies, or (b) allow you to
refuse to accept cookies entirely. For Internet Explorer or AOL users, you can click on the "Start" button and then
select "Control Panel," "Internet Options," and the "Security" tab. If you click on the "Custom" button, you will be
able to see the cookie options. For Netscape users, in the browser, select "File," "Preferences," and then
"Advanced" to view the cookie options. If you disable cookies, certain functions on the Site may not function
properly.

and PAQ is not responsible for the content or information collection practices of these third-party Web sites.
Please note that these third-party Web sites' privacy policies may differ from those of PAQ. PAQ encourages you

third-party Web site with information.

collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. To respect the privacy of children and to comply
with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, children under the age of 13 should not provide any Personal
Information on the Site. We ask that parents supervise their children while their children access the Internet.
Security. PAQ uses commercially reasonable efforts to store and maintain Personal Information to protect it from
loss, misuse, alternation, or destruction by any unauthorized party. For example, PAQ encrypts order information,
including credit card numbers, using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology in order to protect customers'
information as it is sent over the Internet to PAQ's server.

system, please send your request to paqinfo@paq.com.
