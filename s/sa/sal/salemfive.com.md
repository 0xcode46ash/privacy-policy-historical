# Salem Five: Customer Privacy Policy

|  |   
**Customer Privacy Policy**

Technology and new marketing practices have increased the amount of customer information collected and shared in today's marketplace. Consumers are concerned about the need for protection of their personal information. As a financial institution, Salem Five has a special duty to safeguard its customers' sensitive information. To serve our customers as effectively as possible, we must make use of customer information. At the same time, we want our customers to be confident that their financial records and their relationship with the Bank will be treated with the appropriate confidentiality. Therefore we have adopted the following principles to protect the privacy of the information shared with us:

  1. **Recognition of Customers' Expectation of Privacy**

Salem Five recognizes and respects the privacy expectations of its customers and will take appropriate steps to convey its commitment to financial privacy to customers and to bank staff.

  2. **Use, Collection and Retention of Customer Information**

The Bank will collect, retain and use information about individual customers only where it reasonably believes it would be useful (and allowed by law) to administer the Bank's business and to provide products, services and other opportunities to customers. 

Information provided to the Bank or an affiliate within the Salem Five organization by customers or applicants may be shared with other Salem Five affiliates, such as Salem Five Mortgage Corporation or Clippership Financial Services, Inc., in order to offer products or services we think may be of interest to the customer. However, the Bank will honor any request from a customer that their personal information not be so shared. 

  3. **Maintenance of Accurate Information**

The Bank has established procedures to ensure that customers' financial information is accurate, current and complete in accordance with reasonable commercial standards. Should we become aware of any inaccuracies in our records, we will take prompt steps to make appropriate corrections.

  4. **Employee Education**

Salem Five employees will be educated so that they understand the importance of confidentiality and customer privacy. In the event of a breach of privacy responsibilities by an employee, appropriate disciplinary action will be taken.

  5. **Protection of Information via Established Security Procedures**

The Bank will maintain appropriate security standards and procedures to ensure that only employees who are actively engaged in the discharge of their assigned duties are authorized to access or use customer information.

  6. **Restrictions on the Disclosure of Account Information**

Salem Five will not reveal specific information about customers or customer accounts to unaffiliated third parties for their independent use. However, the Bank recognizes the following exceptions to this rule: 

    1. If the customer expressly authorizes the Bank to provide such information, the Bank may honor that request. 
    2. The Bank may provide customer information to an auditor or examiner of the bank, solely for the purpose of an official audit or accounting. 
    3. The Bank may provide information to an attorney or collection agency in furtherance of a legitimate bank purpose, such as the collection of a customer debt. 
    4. The Bank may exchange information about our customers with reputable information reporting agencies or merchants in accordance with standard banking industry practice, so that we can verify the existence and condition of customers' accounts. 
    5. The Bank must comply with certain laws that require mandatory disclosure of customer information. For example, if a customer is involved in a legal proceeding, the Bank may be compelled by court order or subpoena to produce records regarding that customer's accounts or relationship with the Bank. Laws such as the Bank Secrecy Act, the Internal Revenue Code and the Right to Financial Privacy Act may require us, under certain circumstances, to provide certain customer information to government agencies. In such instances, the Bank will limit disclosure to what is required by law. 
  7. **Maintaining Customer Privacy in Business Relationships with Third Parties**

If personally identifiable customer information is provided to a third party, Salem Five will ask that the third party adhere to strict privacy guidelines that provide for keeping such information confidential.
