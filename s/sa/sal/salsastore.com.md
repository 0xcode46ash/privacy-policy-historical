In all cases involving the disclosure of information of a third party, you must obtain the consent of such individuals before disclosing their personal data to us and have informed said individuals about this Privacy Policy.

Your failure to provide personal data may justify our refusal to process your order for the purchase of products sold or to provide one or more services through this Site.
