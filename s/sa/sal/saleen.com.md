# Security

**_Security_**

The Saleen website takes every precaution to protect your personal information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

When our order form asks you to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’.

**_Information Collection & Use_**

When you visit the Saleen web site, we may collect and store information about your visit on an anonymous aggregate basis. This information may include the time and length of your visit, and the pages you look at on our site. We may also record the name of your Internet Service Provider. We use this information only to measure site activity and to develop ideas for improving our site.

There are several opportunities on our website for you to provide us with information about you such as your name, mailing address and email address. If you choose to share any personal information with us, we may store it and use it for marketing purposes. We will not sell your information to any other company without prior notification.

Please be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personal information in public areas of our web site such as the bulletin board, this information can be seen and used by others. We encourage you to use good judgment when sharing information in these forums.

**_Links_**

Please remember that when you click on one of these links, you are leaving our Website and entering another. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other websites, and we encourage you to read their privacy statements (which may differ from ours).

**_Orders_**

We request information from you on the order form in our E-commerce area. Here, you provide contact information (e.g. name and shipping address) and financial information (e.g. credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with you. We occasionally use outside vendors to ship orders. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

**_Cookies_**

Our website makes use of “cookie” technology. A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive containing information about you. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once you close your browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If you opt to reject the cookie, you may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that you will be limited in some areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target your interests to better enhance your experience while visiting our site.

**_Notification of Changes_**

Saleen reserves the right to alter its privacy policy as business needs require. Any changes made to this policy will be posted on our web site in a timely manner
