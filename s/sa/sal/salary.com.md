# Salary.com About Us

Salary.com gathers information from site visitors from time to time to enhance existing services or provide additional services. The company gathers only the information essential for understanding visitors in such a way as to provide better compensation information. This may include contact information such as name, email address, telephone number, and company name, and perhaps other data. The information is used exclusively by Salary.com unless otherwise noted on the site. Salary.com does not make this information available to third parties who trade or rent information for direct marketing purposes.

**Uses of the information**  
Salary.com uses the information it collects for internal purposes to develop products and services better suited to the needs of its users. Occasionally Salary.com provides users’ information to its partners, with those users’ permission. In such instances, Salary.com alerts users that it will share such information, and users may choose whether to provide the information.

Salary.com specifically asks for information about users who participate in site surveys or compensation surveys, who sign up for one of Salary.com’s offerings, or who make a specific request, so as to fulfill those services. Salary.com may also use that information to alert users about additional products and services in which those users might be interested.

Salary.com may share aggregated information about the use of this site to companies with which Salary.com has business relationships. This usage information, such as numbers and frequency of visits, is used to attract appropriate advertisers to various areas of the site. Salary.com provides this data so that advertisers and other businesses can better understand how people use partners’ content and the Salary.com site, with the goal of providing the best possible Web experience.
