Privacy Policy
It is important to appreciate that much of the personal information we collect and hold is done so by us
when we are acting as the “agent” or service provider of our customer. For example, we operate call
centres on behalf of many Australian companies, from retailers to banks and other institutions. When
you contact one of our operators at a call centre, you may not necessarily be aware that the call centre
is operated by a Salmat entity on behalf of our customer. We have set out in the Annexure to this
policy some more detail around the information we may collect and hold in respect of each of our key
businesses. Please read this carefully.
We may also collect some information that is not personal information because it does not identify you
or anyone else. For example, we may collect anonymous data or aggregated information about how
users use our websites. We do not re-identify this information to turn it into personal information.
How do we collect your personal
information?
Personal information is only collected by lawful and fair means in accordance with the Act. We collect
your personal information directly from you unless it is unreasonable or impracticable to do so. When
collecting personal information from you, we may collect in ways including:
      through your access and use of our website, or websites hosted by us;
      through your use of telephone and mobile communication (including but not limited to fixed line
       IVR services, SMS and MMS);
      through your use of electronic devices including tablets, supplied by us to you, or otherwise
       connecting to our systems in order to facilitate and enable you to provide services to us;
      during conversations between you and our representatives;
      during correspondence between you and our representatives, including electronic
       correspondence; or
      when you complete an application, contract or purchase order.
Some of the personal information Salmat holds or deals with is not actually collected by Salmat.
Because Salmat is an outsourced service provider, much of the data and personnel information it
deals with is provided to it by its clients, and has not actually been directly collected by Salmat from
the individual concerned.
It is impracticable for us to collect information directly from you when we are acting as the “agent” or
service provider of our client, our client has already collected the relevant information from you (or
another third party), and our client has provided it to us for our use in providing services to or on behalf
of our client. For example, we act on behalf of many customers in sending email and SMS
communications. To enable us to do so we may use our customer’s database of personal information
which our customer has supplied to us. It is impracticable for us to “recollect” this information from you
directly before we use as requested by our client.
In respect of personal information which is provided to us by our clients, we do seek client assurances
that all such personal information has been collected lawfully and in compliance with the Privacy Act
and that all required consents have been obtained for, and disclosure statements made in respect of,
the intended use of that personal information. Salmat however will not be responsible for, and accepts
no liability in respect of, any failure by a client to do so.
We may also collect personal information from third parties who are not our clients including for
example, from third party companies such as data providers and brokers, credit reporting agencies,
law enforcement agencies and other government entities.

What happens if we can’t collect your
personal information?
If you do not provide us with the personal information described above, some or all of the following
may happen:
      we may not be able to provide the requested products or services to you, either to the same
       standard or at all, or we may not be able to supply services to our clients which will enable our
       clients to do the same; or

       want, including information about discounts, sales or special promotions, or we may not be able

example in relation to (i) employee records; (ii) related bodies corporate; (iii) provision of services to
State or Territory authorities; and (iv) operations outside Australia relating to personal information of
non-Australians. Any permitted handling of personal information under such exemptions will take
priority over this Privacy Policy to the extent of any inconsistency.

as the Spam Act 2003 (Cth). At any time you may opt-out of receiving marketing communications from

You may request access to any personal information we hold about you at any time by contacting us
(see the details below). Where we hold information that you are entitled to access, we will try to

example, we may need to refuse access if granting access would interfere with the privacy of others or
would result in a breach of confidentiality. If that happens, we will give you written reasons for any refusal.
If you believe that personal information we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate, then
you may request us to amend it. We will consider if the information requires amendment. If we do not
agree that there are grounds for amendment then we will, where possible and practicable, add a note
to the personal information stating that you disagree with it.
