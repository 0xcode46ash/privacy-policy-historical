**Privacy Policy**

The Salvation Army is committed to safeguarding your privacy online, and has taken numerous steps to ensure that your privacy is safeguarded at all times when using this site. The following policy will explain how your personal information is stored and treated. This policy is subject to change.

Please note that if you voluntarily disclose personal information online, for example through using our discussion forum, chatroom and contacts sections, then the Salvation Army can not be held responsible for any unsolicited messages that are received as a result of this information being available publicly.

Certain sections of our website are password protected and therefore require registration. These passwords are the responsibility of the user and should be kept secret.

If you have any requests concerning your personal information or any queries with regard to these practices, please contact us by e-mail at 

[registration@salvationarmy.org](mailto:registration@salvationarmy.org)

As this website is UK based, your rights under the UK's Data Protection Act 1998 are provided for on the registration page. 

**What personally identifiable information does the Salvation Army collect from me?**

The Salvation Army collects information in several ways from different parts of our network of web sites.

Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, The Salvation Army asks for your name, e-mail address, birth date, gender, post code and personal interests. If a page asks you for your password, and you enter it correctly, then you are no longer anonymous to the Salvation Army for the duration of that session. A session is finished when your browser is closed, or the website specifically finishes the session.

In addition to registration, we ask you for personal information when completing our feedback form. This information will be used to ensure that we can respond to your enquiries efficiently. The more information you submit, the more specific an answer we can give.

The Salvation Army also requires certain information in order to process credit card donations correctly. Our work worldwide is divided into over 50 territories, and any donation, regardless of its final destination, has to be processed in the donor's local territory. The information collected when making a donation will automatically be routed securely to the relevant office in the donor's territory, where it may also be added to the territory's own donor management system.

The Salvation Army collects IP addresses and sets cookies for reporting purposes. This is data about our users' browsing actions and patterns and does not identify any individual. It is used purely to help improve the website. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. 

**What happens if information about me is incorrect?**

Firstly, go to the registration page and update your account:

[www.salvationarmy.org/registration.nsf/update?openform](https://web.archive.org/registration.nsf/update?openform)

If that does not resolve the issue, then e-mail us at:

[registration@salvationarmy.org](mailto:registration@salvationarmy.org)

**How does the Salvation Army use my information?**

The Salvation Army's primary goal in collecting personal information concerning users is to grant them access to secured areas of the website, such as the discussion forum, and to personalise the user's website experience. The registration page also allows users to opt in to a regular e-mail newsletter.

**With whom does the Salvation Army share my information?**

The Salvation Army is prohibited by virtue of the UK's Data Protection Act 1998 from disclosing any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed. 

Donations:   
If you make a donation from the Salvation Army website, the information you give such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to our payment processing merchant. This is to enable the transaction to take place. Information collected from an online donation may also be added to a local territory's donor management system, which in some cases are operated by trusted third parties.

Shopping:   
If you make a purchase from the Salvation Army website, the information you give such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to our payment processing merchant. This is to enable the transaction to take place.

Finally, the Salvation Army may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating the Salvation Army's Terms of Services or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the Salvation Army's rights or property, other The Salvation Army users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. 

**Collection, use and distribution of your information**

The Salvation Army does sell or rent user information. If you do not wish to allow your data to be shared, you can choose not to use a particular service or select to opt out of your information being shared on the registration page 

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, the Salvation Army cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
