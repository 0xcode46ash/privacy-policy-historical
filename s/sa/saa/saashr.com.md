Unless otherwise agreed to by electronic signature, contact information gathered is not shared with outside organizations or sold to third parties. 

We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. 

## Access to Personally Identifiable Information

If SaaS _hr_.com partners and their end-user client companies request SaaS _hr_.com to delete their personal information, either by postal mail at the contact information listed below, or by using electronic signature, SaaS _hr_ will do so provided that deletion of data will not prevent SaaS _hr_ from complying with its legal obligations.

SaaS _hr_ will retain partner and/or end-user company information for as long as such partner account is active. SaaS _hr_ will retain and use user information as necessary to comply with SaaS _hr_ 's legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce SaaS _hr_ agreements.

SaaS _hr_ will occasionally send users information on its products, services, special deals, promotions, or industry research information. Out of respect for user privacy, SaaS _hr_ presents users with the option to not receive these types of communications by requesting so in writing, by electronic signature, or by using the unsubscribe mechanisms included in promotional emails sent by SaaS _hr_. 

If a partner, eligible employee, or representative wishes to subscribe to SaaS _hr_ newsletter(s), SaaS _hr_ will use the name and email address provided by such party to send the requested material.

## Business Transitions

In the event SaaS _hr_ goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, users' personally identifiable information might be among the assets transferred. Users who are on the current list of recipients of communications referenced earlier will be notified via e-mail or prominent notice on the SaaS _hr_ website for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of users' personal information. 

## Security

The security of user personal information is important to SaaS _hr_. SaaS _hr_ follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to SaaS _hr_ , both during transmission and once the company receives it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, SaaS _hr_ cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

## Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. SaaS _hr_ uses cookies on its website. SaaS _hr_ does not link the information users submit while on the SaaS _hr_ site stored in cookies to any personally identifiable information. 

SaaS _hr_ uses session ID cookies to enable session tracking for SaaS _hr_ customers who login using its website. A session ID cookie expires when a user closes their browser. SaaS _hr_ does not use cookies to monitor a user navigating the website outside of its business applications. If a user rejects cookies, the user may still use SaaS _hr_ 's web site, but the user's ability to login and use the SaaS _hr_.com business application may be limited. 

SaaS _hr_ also uses persistent cookies for visitors who do not login into SaaS _hr_ application. Persistent cookies are data that may be sent to your web browser and stored on your computer. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browsers help directory. Please see more about cookies at this website: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie>. 

## 3rd Party Tracking

Our Service Providers use both session ID and persistent cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site, in order to provide customized user experience for you. The use of cookies by our service providers is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. 

Our third party Service Providers employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons) that help them better manage content on our site. With Web Beacons, when a visitor accesses certain pages on the Site an anonymous notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us or by our Service Providers. Web beacons work in conjunction with cookies to let us know what portions of our Site are of interest to you and to help us provide you with tailored information from our website. Most web browsers can be configured not to accept cookies, or to notify you if a cookie is sent to you. If you turn off cookies, web beacon technologies will still detect anonymous visits, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other anonymous information or personally-identifiable information and are disregarded. 

## Web Beacons

SaaS _hr_ employs, Google Analytics, a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a users computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers personally identifiable information. To learn more about our advertising companys use of clear gifs, please go to [http://www.google.com/analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/).

This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, internet service providers (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating systems, date/time stamp, and click stream data. 

SaaS _hr_ uses this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze web site visitor trends and to track users' movements on the outside-facing website. 

We may also disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend our rights or property, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability. 

You can use the Site without providing any Personal Data; however, you may not be able to use certain Services.
