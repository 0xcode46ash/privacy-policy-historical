## About SampleStuff

Hey there! My name's Sam and I'm a full-time college student at the University Of Connecticut. (If you happen to go there and see someone running from one class to the next with a laptop, that's probably me) I started this blog about 3 years ago just as a way of helping my friends and family save money and I can't believe how much it's grown since then. I sincerely thank all our readers for their support whether it's giving me a heads up on deals, spreading the word about us, or even just visiting, so thank you all =)
