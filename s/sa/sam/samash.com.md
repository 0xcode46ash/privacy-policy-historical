## Cookies and Pixel Tags

A cookie is a small removable data file that is stored by your web browser on your computer. Cookies help to assure you a consistent and predictable experience on our site. For example, we use cookies to remember the items in your Shopping Cart, recognize you when you return to our website, analyze visitor behavior, and provide you with special offers related to your interests.  You can set your browser to warn you each time you receive a cookie or to reject all cookies and still use our site. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your site experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly.

We may use pixel tags to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with our sites and services. We also collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring Web site addresses.

The anonymous information we collect for placing advertising is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major web sites.
