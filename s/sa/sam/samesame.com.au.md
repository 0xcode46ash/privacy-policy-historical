  1. How is personal information collected?    
SameSame.com.au is a new national gay and lesbian website. In order to provide customers with a quality service, SameSame.com.au offers customers the ability to sign up as a community member, interact with other members, subscribe to our newsletter, enter competitions and purchase tickets online through [http://www.SameSame.com.au](http://www.samesame.com.au/). In order to provide these services, SameSame.com.au collects personal information about customers. Collection of this information will occur at the time you enter a competition, make a purchase or when you register as a SameSame.com.au member through our website.
  2. What personal information does SameSame.com.au collect and why?   
If you purchase tickets, register as a member or enter a competition through SameSame.com.au, we need to collect personal information about you, including your name, address, email address and telephone number(s). The reason we need this information is so we can contact you to send you a prize, or to notify you in the case of an event cancellation or change of event details. We also need some of this information in order to process your online credit card payment. SameSame.com.au will also provide you with the opportunity to receive special offers and promotions if you wish to do so. Even if you initially choose to subscribe to receive special offers, you may also unsubscribe or resubscribe at a later stage - all you need to do is visit [http://www.SameSame.com.au/p/newsletter/](http://www.samesame.com.au/p/newsletter/) (or contact SameSame.com.au through the contact details at 12 below). 
  3. Will personal information be given to anyone else?   
SameSame.com.au will not sell or trade personal information about you to or with third parties.

Sometimes, SameSame.com.au needs to collect personal information about individuals who are not customers. This will usually arise where we collect the name and business contact details of our clients. SameSame.com.au's policy is to only use personal information collected from non-customers for the main business purpose for which it was collected.
