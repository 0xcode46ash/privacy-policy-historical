## What Personal Information About Customers Does Same Day Music Gather?

The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience at Same Day Music. Here are the types of information we gather. 

  * Information You Give Us: We receive and store most information you enter on our website or give us in any other way (such as by phone). We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you. 
  * Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Websites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses Same Day Music. These include your IP address, the last page you visited, and a session ID we store on your machine so we can preserve information about you as you travel from page to page (such as your shopping cart contents). A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit Websites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at Same Day Music if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist. 
  * E-mail Communications: At this time we do not send any email communications other than emails relevant to orders you have placed. In the future we will send customized promotional email newsletters, but only to those who have opted to receive them. Also, any time you receive a promotional email, you will receive instructions on how to prevent receipt of any further promotional emails. To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we may choose in the future to receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Same Day Music if your computer supports such capabilities. 
  * Information from Other Sources: For example, we may sometimes receive updated delivery and address information from our shippers or other sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily. 



## What About Cookies?

Cookies are very small alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to a file on your computer through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as storage of items in your shopping cart between visits, storing a record of recent items you have browsed, and other personalized content. 

  * We cannot use "cookies" to access any personal information on your computer, and we cannot use "cookies" to do anything dangerous to your computer. 
  * Cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of Same Day Music's coolest features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on. 
  * However, we want you to know that cookies are not required for basic use of the site, and the "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.

## Does Same Day Music Share the Information It Receives?

No, we will never share your personal information with anybody else, ever. We are in the business of serving you better, not selling your information to others. 

The following exceptions apply in order to allow such activities as filling your order when it is not shipped directly from our own warehouse: 

  * Agents: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to the personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 
  * Promotional Offers: Sometime in the future we may send offers to selected groups of Same Day Music customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, you will be able to exclude yourself from any further such mailings. 
  * Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that Same Day Music, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 
  * Protection of Same Day Music and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Same Day Music, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Same Day Music reserves the right to disclose information identified as likely to be fraudulent (whether proven or not) to government agencies, credit-card companies, their investigators, and the proven cardholder. 
  * With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. 



## How Secure Is Information About Me?

  * We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. 
  * We reveal only some digits of your credit card number when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. 
  * It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.
