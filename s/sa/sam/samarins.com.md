##  What information do we collect?

We do not collect and keep any personal information online from you unless you volunteer it when contacting us using our Contact form.   
We only collect and store the following non-personal aggregate information: your IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) and if possible domain name as well as the type of browser and operating system used to access our website. If you linked to the Samarins.com website from another website, we also collect the address of that website. 

## How do we use collected information

We use this non-personal aggregate information to help us make our site more useful to visitors - to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors are using. We do not track or record information about individuals and their visits. We may use the information you provide in [Contact form](https://web.archive.org/web/20101128231449id_/http%3A//samarins.com/contact3.html) to respond to your questions or comments and we reserve the right to retain whatever information you submit, including your name, e-mail address and any questions or comments submitted. We will not send you any other email unless you contact us first and specifically request information, technical help, or assistance. We do not share, sell or rent this information to any third parties unless this will be required by law. 

## Links to Third Parties 

Samarins.com web sites contain links to other web sites. When accessing the web sites of third parties, including through ad banners and other links, you will be accessing sites that are not operated or controlled by Samarins.com. These sites may collect anonymous and personal information by various methods, including the use of cookies. The privacy policies of these web sites may not be the same as those of Samarins.com and may not afford visitors and citizens the same level of protection. Visitors should contact these advertisers to verify the privacy policies of these web sites and their terms of use when accessing them and prior to providing any anonymous or personal information. 

## Cookies and Web Beacons

Cookies are small pieces of information that a Web site transfers to a visitor's computer for record-keeping purposes while at the site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and you'll find cookies at most major Web sites. We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. We also use third party advertisements on Samarins.com to support our website. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and/or web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing Canadian ads to someone in Canada, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).   


## DART Cookies

We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest based targeting”). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track your personal information. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).  
You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to log-in to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.
