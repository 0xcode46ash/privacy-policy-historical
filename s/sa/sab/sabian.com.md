# SABIAN Cymbals - Privacy Policy

SABIAN considers your personal privacy an important priority.  We have created this information policy because we have a fundamental respect for our members' right to privacy.

 The information collected on the Zone members is only for the use of SABIAN and its designated agents to better understand and serve its customers.  We will not sell or otherwise provide this information to other companies or other individuals.

 This information is collected through direct questionnaires filled out on the site, and linked to Zone member files.  Other information collected in digital polls is not linked to Zone member files and is anonymous.

 SABIAN encourages the interest of children in various aspects of music.  We are pleased that children may be interested in SABIAN products and in drumming, although the Zone and the site as a whole is not directed at children.  We are aware that children may not be able to make informed choices about use of the Internet, or about providing personal information on line.  SABIAN encourages parents to take an active role in monitoring their children's use of this Site, and of the Internet in general.  Parents of children under the age of 13 are requested to provide consent before we can establish a membership and accept information from children in the zone.  Parents are also welcome to see the information that has been collected in their child's Zone member profile page, and have the right to delete or change the information provided.  The exact date of birth is required only to determine which potential Zone members are under the age of 13.  This information is not retained by SABIAN in any form and is not used for any other purpose.

 Any member can access their profile (username and password required) from 'The Zone' section of www.sabian.com.  A member may see their personal information currently on file, and have the option of making changes to this information as required.

 Should a member choose to discontinue their membership, SABIAN will delete the identifiable personal information on file in respect of that member, in the course of removing the membership.

 Data transmission and storage on the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and SABIAN does not make such a guarantee.  SABIAN safeguards the personal information provided by Zone members by using industry-standard methods and technology to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of such information.

 If you have any questions, please contact us:
