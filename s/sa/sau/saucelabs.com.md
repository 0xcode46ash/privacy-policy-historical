# Sauce Labs: Privacy Policy

What personal information about customers does saucelabs.com gather?

The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at saucelabs.com. Here are the types of information we gather.

Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future services for you, improving our service, and communicating with you.

Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses saucelabs.com or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of saucelabs.com on other Web sites.

E-mail Communications: To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from saucelabs.com if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences.

Information from Other Sources: We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. 

What about cookies?

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features based on who you are.

The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of saucelabs.com's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to use any saucelabs.com services that require you to Sign in. 

How secure is information about me?

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.

We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. 

What about third-party advertisers and links to other websites?

Sauce Labs does not display Third-Party advertisements on saucelabs.com at this time. 

What information can I access?

saucelabs.com gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with saucelabs.com for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. The list of information you can access will change as our Web site evolves. 

What choices do I have?

As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to use a service or to take advantage of such saucelabs.com features as Your Profile.

You can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in the "Which Information Can I Access?" section. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.

If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences. (If you do not want to receive Conditions of Use and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of saucelabs.com, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.)

The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of saucelabs.com's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to use any saucelabs.com services that require you to Sign in. 

Are children allowed to use saucelabs.com?
