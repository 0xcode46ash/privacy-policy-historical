# SAUSD - Privacy Policy

The Santa Ana Unified School District (SAUSD) maintains the SAUSD website as a public service.  The following is the privacy policy for this site (all publicly accessible pages in the sausd.k12.ca.us domain): 

## Cookies

The SAUSD website will not require the use of cookie files or cookies to view public information.  A cookie file is an electronic record containing unique information a website can use to track such things as passwords (lists of pages visited) and the date when a specific page was accessed or to identify a user session at a particular website.  A cookie is often used in commercial sites to identify the items selected for a specific shopping cart or web portal.  The SAUSD website may require the use of cookies to facilitate applications that display user-specific web pages.  Information gathered through the use of cookies will only be used by the SAUSD website to facilitate the display of information to the web user. 

## Contacting the District Web Developer

If you send the SAUSD Web Developer an electronic mail message with a question or comment that contains personally identifying information, or fill out a form that transmits this information to the Web Developer, the Web Developer will only use the personally identifiable information to respond to your request and analyze trends.  The Web Developer may redirect the text of your message to another government agency or person who is in a better position to answer your question.  While doing this, however, the Web Developer is bound by procedure to withhold your identifying personal information from the forwarded email.  The Web Developer may direct you to personally contact another agency or person. 

## Newsgroups/Forums

SAUSD forums are public.  Anything posted that contains inappropriate content will be deleted. 

## Collection of information and how it is used

Information is collected for analysis and statistical purposes for site management functions.  This information is not reported or used in any manner that would reveal personally identifiable information.  Log analysis tools are used to create summary statistics, which are used for purposes such as assessing what information is of most interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance for problem areas. 

## Children’s Privacy

The district does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.  Any personal information on a child under the age of 13 that is discovered will be deleted from our system.   **SAUSD encourages parents to go online with their kids**.  Here are a few tips to keep children safe on the Internet: 

  * Teach kids never to give personal information, unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult.  Includes name, address, phone, school, etc.
  * Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate.
  * Look for web site privacy policies in order to find out how your child’s information is treated.



## Mission and Purpose

The SAUSD website is intended to serve as an official compilation of SAUSD electronic resources and services and to provide a means of communication between SAUSD and the public.  The site is organized around four audiences: 

  * Teachers
  * School Administrators
  * Families & Communities
  * Students



The design and layout of the SAUSD website is the responsibility of SAUSD’s District Web Developer. 

## HyperLinks

Any links outside the SAUSD website are provided as a convenience to our viewers.  SAUSD has no control over the content of these linked sites.  SAUSD does not necessarily endorse any products or services sold by any of these linked sites.  SAUSD will link to sites only if they are determined to be aligned with the district's goals and standards. 

## Linking to the SAUSD Website

### What you can do

You do not need to get advance permission to link to the SAUSD website if you are making a simple link to the SAUSD homepage. 

You may also link to one of our sub pages, where appropriate.  The district reserves the right to change sub pages at any time without notice, so it is up to you to continuously verify your links to the district sub pages. 

### What you should not do

Do not capture district pages within your frames, or otherwise present district content as your own.  Any link to our site should be a full forward link that passes the client browser unencumbered to the district site.  The BACK button should return the visitor to your site if the visitor wishes to back out.  You should not link to individual graphics or tables within district pages, especially in an effort to place the downloading burden on district servers.  Such an action may be considered a misuse of district resources. 

### Reciprocal Links

The SAUSD Website does not enter into reciprocal link agreements.  We provide links to sites that are consistent with goals and standards of our district.  Our link to your site does not obligate you to provide a link back to the district site.  You are, however welcome to do so. 

## Changes to this Privacy Notice

Because privacy laws within the United States are in a state of flux and subject to change, SAUSD reserves the right to change this Privacy Notice effective when it is reposted to the SAUSD website.  When changes are made to this Privacy Notice, SAUSD will not reduce the scope of this Privacy Notice.
