**Direct Marketing**

Where we use your information for the purpose of promotional and marketing purposes, we’ll use your personal information to send you direct marketing and to better identify products and services that interest you. We do that if you are one of our supporters, clients or customers or if you’ve interacted with us another way (such as entering a prize promotion, asking to receive e-mails, enquiring into hospitality (whether for a match day or non-match day), competitions or registering your interest by other means).

This means we’ll:

  * create a profile about you to better understand you as a supporter, client or customer and tailor the communications we send you (including our marketing messages);
  * tell you about other products and services you might be interested in;
  * recommend better ways to manage what you spend with us, like suggesting a more suitable product based on what you use; and

We may also share personal information with external auditors, e.g. the audit of our accounts.

We may disclose and exchange information with law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations. 

We may also need to share some personal information with other parties, such as potential buyers of some or all of our business or during a re-structuring. Usually, information will be anonymised but this may not always be possible. The recipient of the information will be bound by confidentiality obligations.

We are dedicated to the protection of children’s personal information. We recommend that children read this privacy policy with their parents and/or guardians. We endeavour to limit the amount of personal information we collect from individuals who are under the age of 13.

We keep different information for different lengths of time but as a rule we will not keep any information in a form that allows the identification of the person it is about for any longer than we have a reason to have it.

**Where your personal information is held**

Information may be held at our offices and those of our third party agencies, service providers, representatives and agents as described above (see above: ‘ **Who we share your personal information with** ’).

Some of these third parties may be based outside the European Economic Area. For more information, including on how we safeguard your personal information when this occurs, see below: ‘ **Transferring your personal information out of the EEA** ’.
