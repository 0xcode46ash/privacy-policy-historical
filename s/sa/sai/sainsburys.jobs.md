### Cookies

Sainsbury's Online Recruitment uses Cookies to make accessing the site more convenient as you won't need to remember your user number. Cookies in conjunction with registration details will allow us to welcome you by name and over time personalise the site content to reflect your preferences. For security reasons you will still need to enter your password and where more than one user uses the same machine it will not be possible to offer this service. The Sainsbury's Online Recruitment Cookie will remain on your hard disk indefinitely.

If you prevent us from placing Cookies on your computer during your visit, then it will not be possible to use the site effectively because the system relies on the Cookie to keep track of the current order, your customer number and your session ID.

Please note that we do not use Cookies to retrieve personal information about you from your computer, unless the information has been knowingly and willingly been provided by you.
