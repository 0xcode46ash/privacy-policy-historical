## Sailthru Industry Best Practices Notice

Sailthru, Inc. ("Sailthru" or "we") has a no tolerance spam policy. "Spam" means unsolicited communication to persons with whom client does not have a business relationship or who have not specifically requested (opted-in to) Customer’s mailing.

A client’s account will be terminated if such client sends Spam. Please contact us immediately to report any suspected abuse. Please forward the complete email in question, including headers. If applicable, please also unsubscribe from the newsletter using the link at the bottom of the email if you no longer wish to receive emails from the sender. We will take the appropriate action against the sender of the email in question. 

All users of our Service must agree to only sending permission-based email. This means that all recipients sent to must have opted-in to receive communications from the sending organization. The opt-in process requires that a potential user actively selects the products or services they are interested in and wish to subscribe to. 

An opt-in can occur either via a sign-up form on client’s web site, at a point-of-sale sign-up form, or on a physical sign-up sheet. Purchased lists may not be used within the Sailthru system, regardless of the source or permission status. 

As a user of Sailthru’s services, you may not: 

  * harvest emails from web sites
  * purchase lists (whether they are opt-in or not)
  * rent lists
  * borrow or lend lists
  * have a subscription form that subscribes users to an unrelated list
  * send out unrelated offers or unrelated content to your newsletter list
  * add an email address into a list without the subscriber’s permission



You may:

  * send out a regular newsletter to a recipient who has opted-in to receive it
  * send out information and content to recipients who have requested to receive content on that topic from your organization
  * send out user triggered emails that result from actions carried out on your website



##### Policy Enforcement 

Sailthru has a no tolerance Spam policy. The strict measures we take to enforce our policy include, but are not limited to: 

We monitor use of the system for any large increases in sending emails 

  * We utilize a content-checking utility to screen and flag any message that contains words common to unsolicited emails.
  * A record is saved of every email that is sent through the system.
  * Any customer found to be using Sailthru’s services for Spam will be immediately cut-off from use of the services.
  * We maintain the IP address and date subscribed for every new subscriber.
  * Every email, whether text or HTML, contains a mandatory unsubscribe/opt-out link at the bottom of the message. This unsubscribe link cannot be removed.



##### Procedure for Handling Complaints

Your account will be immediately terminated if we determine in our sole discretion that you send Spam. We provide our product only to those who follow our strict Anti-Spam Policy. Using the system to send out emails to addresses obtained in any way other than a subscriber opting-in to your list may incur a $100 (US) charge per substantiated incident (i.e. per email) in accordance with state and federal regulations. If you cannot provide proof that these addresses were subscribed to the list, lack of proof is also considered a 'substantiated incident' and will incur a $100.00 (US) charge per incident. 

To determine whether you have sent spam we will: 

  * review the content of the message in question
  * review your subscriber list for patterns common to harvested lists
  * review the Spam complaint
  * view the records to see when the subscriber was subscribed and their IP address

## Cookies and Other Technologies Used by Sailthru

Like many companies, we use cookies and other technologies on our Site and through our Service. Also, by using the Service, you agree that we can place cookies on your device, mobile platform or website as described in our Privacy Statement and this Cookie Notice.

##### What We Do

Sailthru partners with its Account Holders to analyze traffic and other end user activity on behalf of such Account Holders to improve their visitors’and subscribers’ experiences. Sailthru uses cookies, web beacons, Javascript and other technology on its Account Holders’ sites, on the Site and if you receive an email from us or through our Service. If you are a subscriber to one of our Account Holders, we rely on your subscription and the Account Holder’s privacy practices to provide the Service. If you don’t want your browser data to be collected by Sailthru when you visit sites that use Sailthru, you can see the section below entitled "How to Control Cookies".

Sailthru may use web server log files and tracking technologies to collect and analyze certain types of technical information, such as cookies, IP addresses, device type and usage information including time spent on particular pages or number of clicks.

##### Sailthru’s Use of Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies on our Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. If you wish to deactivate cookies while visiting our Site during your browsing session, please see "How to Control Cookies" below. Please note that you may need to erase all cookies that have already been placed on your computer in order to delete the Sailthru cookie.

We sometimes enter into partnerships or hire service providers to help us with our Site and advertise our products and services. The use of cookies by these partners and service providers is not covered by our Privacy Statement or Cookie Statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. In addition, we may provide information to such partners and/ or service providers about how our visitors use our Site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners and service providers also understand how people use our Site. Our third party partners and service providers employ images and scripts that help them better manage content on our Site.

##### How to Control Cookies

The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct users on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies or delete cookies. If you are a user, we strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of web business services like ours. All of our Account Holders must certify that their subscribers have opted-in to receive services; therefore, by disabling cookies you cannot take advantage of your subscriptions and their most attractive features. Some cookies serve an essential function and the websites cannot work properly without them. Where such essential cookies are used, they cannot be disabled.

For more detailed information on how to control cookies you may wish to visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/ "www.allaboutcookies.org")

##### Sailthru’s Use of Web Beacons

We may also use tracking technologies called web beacons to collect information about your visit to the Service. These are small images or Javascriptembedded in web content and HTML-formatted email messages and are ordinarily not visible to users. Like cookies, this technology enables us to track pages and content accessed and viewed by users of the Service. Also, when we send HTML-formatted (as opposed to plain text) emails to you, this technology may be embedded in such emails. Using web beacons allows us to determine whether emails have been opened or links were accessed, and identify aggregate trends, individual usage, and generate statistics about how our Service is used. This enables us to provide you with more relevant content or additional information about our products and services.

Web beacons also allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons enable the ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.

Web beacons are often used in combination with cookies; however unlike cookies, web beacons cannot be declined when delivered via a regular web page. However, they can be refused when delivered via email. If you do not wish to receive this technology via email, configure your email software to disable HTML images or refuse HTML emails (selecting the option for text only viewing). Setting your browser to decline cookies or to prompt you for an opt-in response before cookies are set will also reduce web beacons' functionality.

Sailthru uses Third Party Services includingGoogle Analytics, to collect information about how visitors use the Site in order to optimize visitor experiences. Google Analytics uses web beacons and cookies in order totrack visitor page views and clicks within pages, length of time spent on our Site, and the search term or referring site that brought a visitor to our Site.

##### Do Not Track

Since there is no uniform technological standard for "Do Not Track", our Site does not respond to browser "Do Not Track" signals.
