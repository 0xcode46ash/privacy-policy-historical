# Sailor Jerry | Privacy Policy

## Privacy Policy

This Privacy Statement sets forth the information gathering, use, and dissemination practices of Sailor Jerry Ltd. ("SJ") in connection with the World Wide Web site located at www.sailorjerry.com (the "Site"). This Privacy Statement addresses SJ's practices regarding information collected only directly through or from the Site. It does not address or govern any information gathering, use, or dissemination practices related to information collected other than directly through or from the Site, including, without limitation, from or via telephone, facsimile, postal mail, personal delivery, or other or additional offline means or media. SJ can be contacted by mail at 421 N. 7th Street Suite 416 Philadelphia, PA 19123, by phone at 215.625.2561, by facsimile at 215.625.2773, or by e-mail at [customerservice@sailorjerry.com](mailto:customerservice@sailorjerry.com)

## 1\. Collection of Personal Information from Site Visitors

SJ may collect or track (1) the home server domain names, e-mail addresses, type of client computer, files downloaded, search engine used, operating system, and type of Web browser of visitors to the Site, (2) the e-mail addresses of visitors that communicate with SJ via e-mail, (3) information knowingly provided by the visitor in online forms, registration forms, surveys, e-mail, contest entries, and other online avenues (including, without limitation, demographic and personal profile data), and (4) aggregate and user-specific information regarding which pages Site visitors access.

SJ may place Internet "cookies" on visitors' hard drives. Internet cookies save data about individual visitors, such as the visitor's name, password, user-name, shopping cart, screen preferences, and the pages of a site viewed by the visitor. When the visitor revisits the Site, SJ may recognize the visitor by the Internet cookie and customize the visitor's experience accordingly. Visitors may decline Internet cookies, if any, by using the appropriate feature of their Web client software, if available.

When a visitor performs a search within the Site, SJ may record information identifying the visitor or linking the visitor to the search performed. SJ may also record limited information for every search request and use that information to solve technical problems with the services available directly or indirectly in connection with the Site and to calculate overall usage statistics.

## 2\. Use of Personal Data Collected

Personal data collected by SJ may be used by SJ for many reasons, for example, for editorial and feedback purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, for a statistical analysis of users' behavior, for product development, for content improvement, for fulfillment of a requested transaction or recordkeeping, or to customize the content and layout of the Site. Aggregate data on visitors' home servers may be used for internal purposes, and individually identifying information, such as names, postal and e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and other personal information which visitors voluntarily provide to SJ may be added to SJ's databases and used for future calls and mailings regarding Site updates, new products and services, and upcoming events.

SJ also may use Site visitor data to contact the Site visitors regarding account status and changes to the submissions agreement, privacy statement, and any other policies or agreements relevant to Site visitors.

## 3\. Disclosure of Personal Data to Third Parties

SJ shall not disclose any of your personally identifiable information to third parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SJ may disclose or distribute identifiable or non-identifiable data to a third party with which SJ enters or reasonably may enter into a corporate transaction, such as, for example, a merger, consolidation, acquisition, or asset purchase, or to a third party pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other form of legal process, in response to a request by or on behalf of any local, state, federal, or other government agency, department, or body, whether or not pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other form of legal process, or if determined by SJ in its sole judgment that such disclosure or distribution is appropriate to protect the life, health, or property of SJ or any other person or entity. While SJ may undertake efforts to see that such third party is under a contractual obligation to use the personal data solely for the purposes for which the data was disclosed, such third parties may be independent third parties over which SJ may not exercise control, and SJ is not responsible for their conduct, actions, omissions, or information handling or dissemination practices and SJ will not be liable therefore.

This Site may contain links to other World Wide Web sites or advertisements for or placed by third parties. SJ is not responsible for the privacy practices of such Web sites, advertisers, or third parties, or for the content of such sites or advertisements. It is possible that these links or advertisements, themselves, may be used by third parties or others to collect personal or other information about Site visitors. It is solely the visitors' obligation to review and understand the privacy practices and policies of these other Web sites and of these advertisers and third parties.

## 4\. Security Measures

SJ has implemented numerous security features to prevent the unauthorized release of or access to personal information. For example, credit and debit card details are sent by secure SSL encrypted means to process the payment of any and all orders. Please be advised, however, that the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to or from SJ via this Site or e-mail cannot be guaranteed. Accordingly, SJ is not responsible for the security of information transmitted via the Internet. Instead of communicating with SJ via e-mail or the Internet, visitors can contact SJ by mail at 421 N. 7th Street Suite 416 Philadelphia, PA 19123, by phone at 215.625.2561, by facsimile at 215.625.2773.

## 5\. Opt-Out Right

Except as necessary for SJ to provide the services, information, or products requested by a visitor, the visitor may opt out of having his or her personally identifiable information, which has been voluntarily provided to SJ through an account registration, customer order, or electronic news or information subscription, prospectively retained by SJ, used by SJ for secondary purposes, or disclosed by SJ to third parties by contacting SJ via postal mail, e-mail, or telephone at the addresses set out above. (This does not apply to collection of the type of Web browser of the visitor to the Site or to information provided or collected that does not meet the above description.)

## 6\. Access to and Ability to Correct Personal Data

Upon a visitor's request via postal mail, e-mail, or phone, SJ will provide to the visitor a summary of any personally identifiable information retained by SJ regarding the visitor, which information has been voluntarily provided to SJ through an account registration, customer order, or electronic news or information subscription. A visitor may modify, correct, change or update their personally identifiable information by contacting SJ via postal mail, e-mail, or telephone at the addresses or numbers above.

## 7\. Collection of Personal Data from Children

To the extent that SJ is able to determine the age of users by their submissions to or communications with the Site, SJ will not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personally identifiable information from individuals under the age of eighteen ("children") without their parent's or guardian's consent, which information has been voluntarily provided to SJ through an account registration, customer order, or electronic news or information subscription.

Upon request from a parent or guardian of a child who has provided such personally identifiable information to the Site, SJ will (i) provide to the parent or guardian a description of the specific types of information collected from the child, (ii) provide to the parent or guardian a means and stated procedures to review such information and to halt future disclosure, use, and maintenance of such information (e.g., the parent or guardian has the option to consent to the collection and use of their child's personally identifiable information without consenting to the disclosure of that information to third parties), as applicable, (iii) cease collection in the future of such information from the child, or (iv) provide any combination of the foregoing.

SJ is prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an activity on the child's disclosing more personally identifiable information than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity.

If there are no age restrictions on a contest which requires registration, and if a child wins, notification and prizes will be sent to the parent(s) or guardian(s) identified in the initial registration process.

## 8\. SJ's Right to Contact User

SJ reserves the right to contact Site visitors regarding account status and changes to the subscriber agreement, privacy statement, and any other policies or agreements relevant to Site visitors.

## 9\. Right to Change Privacy Statement

SJ may change this Privacy Statement at any time. It is the obligation of users visiting the Site to familiarize themselves with this Privacy Statement. Any change to this Privacy Statement shall be effective as to any visitor who has visited the Site before any change was made.
