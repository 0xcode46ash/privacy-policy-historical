Our privacy & cookie policy takes into account several legal instruments, including:

  * the Data Protection Act 1998
  * the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 as amended by The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) (Amendment) Regulations 2011

 **Notification of change of privacy & cookie policy**

We reserve the right to amend this privacy statement. You are advised to visit this website section periodically in order to keep up to date with the changes in our privacy policy.

 **CONSENT**

By using our website, our social media pages (such as Facebook), subscribing to our services, donating to us and/or shopping online you agree that we can place the types of cookies set out below on your device and use your data in accordance with this policy.

In order to remember that you have accepted our use of cookies, we will place a temporary cookie to remember your consent for 3 months.

 **PRIVACY POLICY**

 **Emails terms of use**

Emails aren’t always secure, and they may be intercepted or changed after they’ve been sent. Save the Children doesn’t accept liability if this happens. The contents of emails reflect their author's views and not necessarily those of Save the Children.

Please _do not_ send Save the Children any financial data through email.

The information in emails is confidential, so if you’ve received one by mistake, please delete it without copying, using, or telling anyone about its contents.

 **How do we collect information?**

We may collect information about you whenever you interact with us. For example, when you contact Save the Children regarding our activities, register as a supporter, send or receive information or make a donation to us, you specifically and knowingly provide us with your personal information.

We may also receive information about you from third parties – but only if you’ve given them permission to share your information.

 **What information do we collect?**

When you interact with us, we may collect names, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, bank account details for setting up a regular direct debit and, where appropriate, dates of birth. We _do not_ use cookies to collect this type of information. All online financial transactions will be encrypted using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).

 **Will we disclose the information we have collected to outside parties?**

If you give your consent, we may pass your information to our service providers, associated organisations and other related organisations which may share the aims and objectives of Save the Children. If you do not want this to happen, please tick the box where provided.

We may also need to disclose your information if required to do so by law.

 **How we protect your personal information?**

We take appropriate physical, electronic and managerial measures to ensure that we keep your information secure, accurate and up to date, and that we only keep it as long as is reasonable and necessary.

Although we use appropriate security measures once we have received your personal information, the transmission of information over the internet is never completely secure. We do our best to protect personal information, but we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted to our website, so any transmission is at the user’s own risk. However, any payment card details (such as credit or debit cards) we receive on our website are passed securely to our payment processing provider according to the Payment Card Industry Security Standards.

 **Job applicants and current and former employees**

If you apply to work at the Save the Children, we will only use the information you give us to process your application and to monitor recruitment statistics. If we want to disclose information to someone outside the Save the Children - for example, if we need a reference, or need to get a ‘disclosure’ from the Criminal Records Bureau - we will make sure we tell you beforehand, unless we are required to disclose this information by law.

When recruiting for a post based in another country, Save the Children will sometimes need to transfer your personal information to that country to progress the recruitment. It may be that that country does not provide the same level of data protection as in the European Economic Area.

If you are unsuccessful in your job application, we will hold your personal information for 6 months after we’ve finished recruiting the post you applied for. After this date we will destroy or delete your information.

If you begin employment with us, we will put together a file about your employment. We keep the information in this file secure, and will only use it for matters that apply directly to your employment.

Once you stop working for us, we will keep this file according to our record retention guidelines. You can contact us to find out more about this.

If you apply for a job or volunteering opportunity we will also collect information so we can assess your suitability for the role.

Please refer to the [Data Protection, Privacy and Recruitment Statement](https://jobs.savethechildren.org.uk/our-policies/dataprotection/) for further information.

 **Your credit card information**

If you use your credit card to donate to us, buy something or make a booking online, we pass your credit card details securely to our payment processing partner as part of the payment process. We do this in accordance with the Payment Card Industry Security Standard (PDF download), and don’t store the details on our website.

 **Can you gain access to your personal information?**

You may request a copy of the personal information relating to you which is kept on file by Save the Children (for which we may charge a small fee) by contacting the [Data Protection Officer](mailto:mailto:dataprotection@savethechildren.org.uk).

 **How to update my information or change my marketing preferences?**

If you want to update the information we hold for you, or you think any information we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, please get in touch as soon as possible. Please email [supportercare@savethechildren.org.uk](mailto:supportercare@savethechildren.org.uk), or telephone 020 7012 6400 (or 00 44 20 7012 6400 if you are calling from outside the UK).

 **COOKIE POLICY**

 **Cookies and how we use them**

 _ **What are cookies?**_

Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user’s device.

You can find more information about cookies at: [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/ "Link to All About Cookies website \(opens in a new window\)") and [www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ "Link to Your Online Choices website \(opens in a new window\)") for a video about cookies visit [www.google.co.uk/goodtoknow/data-on-the-web/cookies](http://www.google.co.uk/goodtoknow/data-on-the-web/cookies "Link to Google website \(opens in a new window\)")

 _ **Do we use cookies?**_

Yes.

 _ **Types of cookies**_

There are two broad types of cookies - 'first party cookies' and 'third party cookies':

  * First party cookies are cookies that are served directly by the website operator to your computer, and are often used to recognise your computer when it revisits that site and to remember your preferences as you browse the site. Basically, these are our cookies.
  * Third party cookies are served by a service provider on behalf of the website operator, and can be used by the service provider to recognise your computer when you visits other web sites. Third party cookies are most commonly used for web site analytics or advertising purposes.



In addition, cookies may be either 'session cookies' or 'persistent cookies'. Your computer automatically removes session cookies once you close your browser. Persistent cookies will survive on your computer until an expiry date specified in the cookie itself, is reached. We use both session and persistent cookies.

 _3\. Functionality cookies:_ These cookies remember choices made by the user and enhance the features, e.g. language or users location. This cookie is also used to remember a user's preferences for a font size, or customisable parts of a web page.

 _4\. Targeting or advertising cookies:_ These cookies collect information about the users' browsing habits. This may also include your use of social media sites, e.g. Facebook, etc. or how you interact with our website which then shows you relevant content elsewhere on the internet. NB. These may also be used to remarket to you in limited circumstances.

We have assessed our cookies based on the [ICC Cookie Guide](https://www.cookielaw.org/media/1096/icc_uk_cookiesguide_revnov.pdf). The majority of our cookies fall into the first two categories. However, we also use cookies on our webpages which are in categories 3 and 4.

Some of this will be used by third party cookies to target you with relevant advertising (see below).
