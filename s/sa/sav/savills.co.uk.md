# Savills UK | Privacy & Cookies

Savills is a trading name of Savills plc. Savills is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. This Privacy Policy explains how we use the information we collect about you, how you can instruct us if you prefer to limit the use of that information and procedures that we have in place to safeguard your privacy.

## 1. The information we collect and how we use it

When you register with our web site in order to receive our research reports we need to know your name, e-mail address, and contact telephone numbers, sectors in which you are interested and geographic regions of interest.

We gather this information to allow us to process your registration and provide you with the research reports requested by you.

From time to time we may provide your information to our customer service agencies for research and analysis purposes so that we can monitor and improve the services we provide. We or our agents and sub-contractors may contact you by post, e-mail or telephone to ask you for your feedback and comments on our services.

On registration you may have indicated that you were happy to be contacted by our group of companies with information about special features of our web site or any other service or products which we think may be of interest to you. If you no longer wish to receive this information, please send a blank e-mail message to [data@savills.com](mailto:data@savills.com)

You may also have elected to receive information from third parties which we think may be of interest to you. If you would rather not receive this information, please send an e-mail to [data@savills.com](mailto:data@savills.com)

We may also provide your information to carefully selected third parties whose products or services we believe may be of interest to you. If you do not wish us to disclose your information in this way, please send an e-mail to [data@savills.com](mailto:data@savills.com)

## 2. How we protect your information

The internet is not a secure medium. However we have put in place various security procedures as set out in this policy.

Savills takes the security and privacy of its customers' personal information extremely seriously. We have strict internal procedures which cover the storage, access and disclosure of your information.

## 4. Updating your details

If any of the information that you have provided to Savills changes, for example if you change your e-mail address, name or payment details or if you wish to cancel your registration, please let us know the correct details by sending an e-mail to [data@savills.com](mailto:data@savills.com) [or by sending a letter to Savills Database Management, Finsbury Circus House, 15 Finsbury Circus, London EC2M 7EB]

## 5. Your consent

By submitting your information you consent to the use of that information as set out in this Policy. If we change our Privacy Policy we will post the changes on this page, and may place notices on other pages of the web site, so that you may be aware of the information we collect and how we use it at all times. We will also e-mail you should we make any changes so that you may consent to our use of your information in that way. Continued use of the service will signify that you agree to any such changes.

Because the Internet infrastructure is global the information you provide may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area that do not have similar data protection legislation during use as set out in this Policy. However, we have taken the steps outlined above to try to improve the security of your information. You should be aware that if you request updates from our Asia Pacific offices, your data will be shared with those offices. However your data will still be subject to Savills' internal confidentiality procedures.
