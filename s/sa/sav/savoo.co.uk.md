**Privacy Statement**

Savoo is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our many offerings. This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically. This Privacy Statement only covers the site Savoo.

**

Savoo is in compliance with the current draft of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) specification, <http://www.w3c.org/P3P>, dated April 16, 2002. This specification was developed to allow users to more easily evaluate the use of personal information collected by the web sites they visit. Thus, if your browser is Microsoft Internet Explorer Version 6, or later, your browser can electronically interpret the P3P version of our privacy policies.  


If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

In addition, we might receive information about you from other sources (such as service providers) for tracking purposes. We may add the information we receive about you to your existing account. Like other websites, we also automatically receive and record certain types of information every time you visit us. We use "cookies" and the other information to enhance your experience and present you with personalized offers. See "Cookies and IP Addresses" section below.  


**With whom your Information may be shared

Savoo does not sell trade or rent your personal information to other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:   


**Service Requests or Loan Products -** If you submit a request for a loan product or service offered through this website we will share the personal information contained in your request form, such as your full name, physical address, telephone number, property location and self-assessed value, with lenders in our provider network strictly to process and fulfill your request. All lenders in our provider network, which include banks, mortgage lenders and brokers, have entered into marketing agreements with Savoo and are required to comply with federal and state privacy regulations. The lenders may contact you by telephone, email, or mail based on the information you provided to us in order to process and fulfill your request, even if you have opted into the National Do Not Call List administered by the Federal Trade Commission or any state equivalent Do Not Call List. If one of the lenders contacts you by telephone and you wish not to be contacted again by that lender with respect to your inquiry, then you should specifically make a request to that lender not to contact you again. If the lender disregards your request and contacts you again, please let us know immediately by sending an email to Savoo [Customer Care](http://savings.zendesk.com/home). Please note that the lenders may maintain the information you provided whether you elect to use their services or not.
