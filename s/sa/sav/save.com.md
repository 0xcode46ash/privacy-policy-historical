# Coupons, Inc. Business Site

Coupons, Inc.  
Coupons, Inc. recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of all information provided to us and to our clients through the use of our services and related websites. We created the following policy guidelines with a fundamental respect for your right to privacy to guide our relationship with you. 

About This Privacy Statement  
The following Privacy Statement covers how Coupons, Inc. treats personal information that Coupons, Inc. collects and receives on its own behalf or on behalf of its clients. Personal information is information about you that identifies you specifically like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Coupons, Inc. does not own or control, or to people we do not employ or manage. Some of our clients, such as Smartsource, Boodle, WebMD, and various corporate clients, have their own privacy statements that can be viewed on their web sites. 

General  
Coupons, Inc. collects personal information in connection with several of our business services. We collect personal information primarily in connection with services provided to other businesses, and their use of that data is covered by their privacy policies. We collect and use personal information as described in the sections below. 

We will never share, sell, or rent your personal information with anyone without your advance permission except as described in this Privacy Statement or unless ordered by a court of law. Personal information is stored in a highly secure data center environment, and access to the information is limited to those Coupons, Inc. employees with a need to manage it. 

Printing Coupons from Web Pages, Emails, and Banner Ads  
Coupons, Inc. requires the installation of a small piece of software on your computer—either an ActiveX object or an Internet Plug-in. You do not have to provide any personal information to install or use the software. The software does not collect any personal information from you or your computer or your browser. In some cases we collect zip codes in conjunction with the installation of our software. Zip codes are not personal information, but the zip code may be combined with personal information at another time, as described in this Privacy Statement. 

If you have trouble printing a coupon, in some cases you may be allowed to order one in the mail and/or provide feedback on your problem. We collect your name, postal address, email address, and other personal information in order to mail you a coupon or correspond with you regarding your technical problem. We may automatically collect information about your computer operating system and browser and combine that information with your personal information in order to better diagnose the problem. The information collected in this manner is not used for any other purpose. 

We similarly provide our clients with the ability to send you a coupon if you correspond with them. They may collect your name and address and email address using our system, and we will use that information only to send coupons to you as requested by our client. 

Some coupon programs allow you to tell a friend about the coupon you just printed. In that case we may collect your name and email address. We will also collect the names and email addresses that you provide to us in order to send them a coupon. We will only use this information to send the coupons as you requested. This information is **not** retained in our system. 

Information Collected Other Than From Coupon Printing  
From time to time Coupons, Inc. may collect information before or after you print a coupon, or with no associated coupon. In some cases, we will collect personal information on our own behalf to fulfill your requests for offers and promotions, provide you with ongoing promotional opportunities and to send you advertising and promotions on behalf of our clients and advertisers. In such cases you will always be provided with notice that we intend to collect personal information and you will have an opportunity to opt-out of future messages or use of your personal information. 

Coupons, Inc. may collect personal information on behalf of its clients. It may associate such information collected with other, publicly available information, or information that you have previously provided, only if you indicated that it was OK to receive third party offerings. You will always be provided with notice that personal information is being collected and given a link to the privacy policy of the company that will receive the information. If Coupons, Inc. is also retaining this personal information, you will be notified and given a link to this Privacy Statement. 

Our clients and advertisers may collect personal information before or after offering you a coupon. Coupons, Inc. does not have any control over such collection. You should refer to the privacy policy of the company collecting the information. 

Printing Coupons from Microsite Networks  
Coupons, Inc. provides technology and services to other marketing companies offering collections of coupons on a network of websites. These websites incorporate elements (primarily branding and navigation) of their affiliates, who promote their coupon services. Coupons, Inc. does not control the collection of personal information on those networks, although we do host the pages. These Microsite Networks may collect personal information as part of a registration process, in connection with advertising and promotions, or other purposes. Coupons, Inc. collects such personal information only on behalf of its client and has access to such personal information only in connection with its operation and maintenance of its clients’ networks. 

Cookies may be used to store your login information, if you choose. Session IDs and other temporary settings may be used to provide you with the best experience while browsing through and printing coupons. 

In some cases, Coupons, Inc. may itself be an affiliate of one of these Microsite Networks. If you visit such an affiliated site, you will be given notice that Coupons, Inc. also collects information, and this Privacy Statement will apply to our use of your information. 

If you provide personal information on a Coupons, Inc. controlled Microsite Network affiliate web site, we may collect personal information. You will be given an opportunity to indicate whether you want to receive offers from the Microsite Network and/or from third parties. We may use your personal information to present offers to you on the web site and if you gave permission, in email. If you gave permission, we may allow others to send you offers. You can change your personal profile or marketing preferences at any time by using the features provided on the site. 

Our Websites  
Client-side cookies are used to verify the login status of our clients using products or services linked directly with our website. Use of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site; however, the user may not be able to access all areas of our site. 

At times we will use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our web site. We also may track browser types to help us understand our visitors' needs related to our web site design. 

There are optional sections of our web site where input forms require your name, company, and e-mail address. These forms or in some cases the emails you receive as a result of filling out the forms provide the ability to opt-out of receiving future emails of any sort from Coupons Inc. If you opt-in to receiving email communications from us, then we may send information to you on our products or services. 

Coupons Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any other web sites to which we link. 

From time to time we may display ads from other companies or third party ad servers. Coupons, Inc. is not responsible for their privacy practices. 

Email  
Coupons, Inc., (sometimes doing business as Conduit Media) provides email marketing services. Our service enables businesses to send permission-based emails to their subscribers and others who have indicated an interest in receiving third-party offers. Coupons Inc. believes in the tenets of permission-based email marketing. Our clients may only use our services to send emails to customers and prospects that have agreed to receive email from them or from third parties generally. Coupons Inc./Conduit Media forbids the transmission of unsolicited commercial email (spam) via our system. 

Coupons, Inc./Conduit Media maintain lists of consumer email addresses and other personally identifiable information collected in accordance with this Privacy Statement, and also on behalf of third parties who collect such information pursuant to their own privacy policies. In the case of third party lists, we require such third party to supply the source of the names and email addresses and the method used to capture the data. We also require them to certify that they are in full compliance with CAN-SPAM. 

If our clients choose to use their own opt-in list of email addresses, we require them to supply the source of the names and email addresses, and the method used to capture the data. The manner in which the names were captured is important when responding to subscriber complaints that Coupons Inc./Conduit Media may receive. We also encourage our clients to respect their customers’ time and attention by controlling the frequency of mailings to individual email addresses. 

_How do we protect your privacy?_  
We use strict security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of data used by our system. 

_Why did you receive an email from our system?_  
If you received an email from us, it is because one of our clients used the Coupons Inc./Conduit Media service to send you an email. Our clients must agree that all email addresses used in our system are opt-in names that have given permission to the client to send them email. We promise to keep your email address secure and private and agree not to use it for other purposes. Every email message sent includes a link to opt-out from future mailings. We process such requests as soon as possible but always within 10 days. You will always have the choice to be removed from the specific list that sent you the email or all lists managed by Coupons, Inc./Conduit Media. Please keep in mind that if you opt-in to a list that is managed by Coupons, Inc./Conduit Media in the future, you may receive mailings again. 

_CAN SPAM email Changes._  
Starting January 1, 2004 the federal CAN-SPAM Act, focusing on protecting email recipients from predatory and abusive commercial email practices, came into effect. We applaud these new protections that have been a part of our email policy even before the CAN-SPAM legislation. Coupons, Inc./Conduit Media is fully CAN-SPAM compliant. 

_How do I get off an email list?_  
Each email sent through the Coupons Inc./ Conduit Media system contains a link that allows subscribers to unsubscribe from receiving emails from the sender. Each email sent contains an easy and automated way for you to unsubscribe. Also, you can change your expressed interests at any time. If you wish to unsubscribe or change your interests, simply follow the instructions at the bottom of any email. If you have received an unwanted email sent by the Coupons Inc./Conduit Media system, please forward a copy of the email with your comments to [abuse@conduitmedia.com](mailto:abuse@conduitmedia.com). 

_Verified Opt-in_  
As an email list manager we try very hard to ensure that the web sites whose lists we manage are following best practices for opt-ins, but we recognize that we cannot verify the opt-in status of every name on every list that is provided to us by our list owners, which is why we make it easy for anyone to opt-out. 

If you have received unwanted, unsolicited email sent via the Coupons Inc./Conduit Media system, or purporting to be sent by Coupons Inc./Conduit Media, please forward a copy of that email with your comments to [abuse@conduitmedia.com](mailto:abuse@conduitmedia.com) for review. 

If you have any questions about this Privacy Statement or the use of personal information in any of our services, please contact us at: [privacy@coupons.com](mailto:privacy@coupons.com).
