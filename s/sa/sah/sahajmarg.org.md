# Shri Ram Chandra Mission - Privacy Policy

## Introduction

This is the policy of the Shri Ram Chandra Mission of India and its national and regional Shri Ram Chandra Mission sister organisations throughout the world (hereafter collectively referred to as SRCM ) concerning the personal information that they collect, store and process of their members ( abhyasis ) and other persons.

No content from this site may be copied, framed, reproduced, republished, uploaded, posted, transmitted, or distributed in any way, except that you may temporarily download one copy of the content on any single computer or print one or more copies of the content for your personal, noncommercial use only, provided you keep intact all copyright, trademark and other proprietary notices.

## Objectives of this privacy policy

This privacy policy seeks to achieve that the personal information that SRCM collects, processes and stores of its members is:

  1. Fairly and lawfully processed.
  2. Processed for limited purposes.
  3. Adequate, relevant and not excessive.
  4. Accurate.
  5. Kept no longer than necessary.
  6. Processed in accordance with the data subject’s rights.
  7. Secure.
  8. Transferred only to sister organisations with adequate protection.
  9. Transferred only to third parties with permission from the data subject or as required by law.



## Collection and processing

Persons that apply for membership of SRCM provide personal information. This information is stored in a database of members worldwide and processed in relation to membership administration, issuing of membership cards, and in relation to the services that SRCM provides to its members, such as participation at satsangh, seminars and other events, and sales of and subscriptions to books, magazines and other articles. This personal information is stored and when needed processed as long as the person remains a member of SRCM.

Up to 2012, the database of members worldwide was located in India for members residing in India, and located in a data centers in India and the United States for members not residing in India. (Prospective) members filled out paper forms; this information was entered at national or regional level in spreadsheets, and sent via email to USA which may be forwarded to India (in case of prospective members not residing in India), where it was entered into the database. For members residing in India, the information on the paper forms was directly entered into the database by coordinators. This system will be phased out during 2012.

In 2012, a new data management system will gradually be introduced, located in the USA, with the name AIMS (Abhyasi Information Management System). AIMS will be installed in one or more servers owned and rented at data centers located in India and the USA.

For most countries, an online interface ( web form ) will enable persons to apply for registration as member of SRCM and for a membership card directly with AIMS in the USA. Certain specific information will be forwarded to a vendor located in India where the Membership Card will be produced. For some countries, paper forms may continue to be used, before the data is entered into AIMS. SRCM issues membership cards, which are manufactured in India.

For India, paper forms will be used for the foreseeable future; the information on the paper forms will be entered into the database by coordinators.  However, SRCM may, when appropriate, choose to utilize the web form for Indian members who are able to submit their details online.

In addition, SRCM occasionally processes personal data related to non-members (e.g., family or friends of members that participate in events or hold subscriptions to magazines or book series). This data may be submitted by the persons themselves or by others, e.g., a member of SRCM submitting registration information for a seminar for his family, or giving a magazine subscription as a present to a family member.

In addition, SRCM may process data related to former members, e.g., when they maintain subscriptions to SRCM magazines or other publications after their membership has expired. Certain specific information will be forwarded to a vendor located in India where the publication subscriptions, audio, video, photographs and other print media are produced and distributed under license fro SRCM.

For the purposes of registration for events or subscriptions to journals or books, the relevant personal information in the membership database may be accessed or copied to facilitate the registration or subscription process.

In addition, SRCM shall process data related to Prefect Lists. This information is shared with the President and other responsible functionaries of the Mission.

If SRCM wants to use personal information for any purpose not described in this Privacy Policy, it will ask for prior consent.

## Updating and correction

SRCM strives to update any out-dated information and correct any inaccurate information. When the personal information of members of SRCM has changed, e.g., in case of change of address, or when their data needs correction, members are requested to submit an on-line notification form, available at <https://apps.sahajmarg.org/idcard/updateCardRequest?action=update>

## Deletion

Personal data stored and processed in relation to a particular event or to subscriptions will be deleted when no longer needed in relation to the organisation of the event or the subscription. This will happen at the latest 2 years after the end of the event or 2 years after the termination of the subscription, unless there is a requirement for longer retention under applicable law.

Local SRCM centres may ask participants in satsangh and other events to sign a register of participants (‘golden book’). These registers are kept as a record of attendance and are destroyed at the latest 10 years after they are full or no longer used.

When a person terminates his/her membership of SRCM, his/her personal information is deleted, in as far as not still required for specific purposes, e.g., in conjunction with recent participation in events, ongoing subscriptions, or processing of donations. Upon request of such a person, his/her personal data will be deleted forthwith if it is not otherwise required to be retained by applicable law.

In order to request deletion of personal information from the membership database, you can use the notification form mentioned above. If you would like confirmation that your personal information has been deleted from the membership database, please contact the Data Protection Officer for your region.
