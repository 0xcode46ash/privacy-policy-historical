## What This Privacy Policy Covers

This policy covers how S2KI treats personal information that S2KI collects and receives, including information related to your past use of S2KI products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.

This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that S2KI does not own or control, or to people that S2KI does not employ or manage.

## Information Collection and Use

S2KI may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.

When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. Once you register with S2KI and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.

S2KI collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners, including information about your use of services that we offer.

S2KI automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you request.

S2KI uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

S2KI does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

  1. We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with S2KI under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help S2KI communicate with you about offers from S2KI and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
  2. We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;
  3. We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of S2KIÃ•s terms of service, or as otherwise required by law.
  4. We transfer information about you if S2KI is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, S2KI will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
  5. S2KI displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria \- for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.



S2KI does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.

## Cookies

S2KI may share this information with internal and external partners for the purpose of providing S2KI services.
