# Sysinternals Freeware - About Us

Sysinternals LLC ("Sysinternals"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsoft Corporation, is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy statement applies to the data collected by Sysinternals through the Sysinternals site (the "Site"); it does not apply to data collected through other online or offline Sysinternals sites, products or services. 

##  Collection of Your Personal Information

We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you. The personal information we collect may include, for example, name, email address, date of birth, and demographic information. 

We may collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with the Site. We also collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring Web site addresses. 

##  Use of Your Personal Information

The personal information collected on this Site will be used to operate the Site and to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized. 

In support of these uses, Sysinternals may use personal information to provide you with more effective customer service, to improve the Site and any related products or services of Sysinternals or its affiliates, and to make the Site easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing the Site to your particular preferences or interests. 

We may use your personal information to provide you with important information about the product or service that you are using, including critical updates and notifications. Additionally, with your permission, we may send you information about other Sysinternals products and services, and/or share information with Sysinternals partners so they may send you information about their products and services. 

Sysinternals occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as Web site hosting, packaging, mailing and delivering prizes, answering customer questions about products and services, and sending information about our products, special offers, and other new services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. 

Sysinternals and its affiliates may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Sysinternals or the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Sysinternals and our Web site; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Sysinternals products or members of the public. 

Personal information collected on the Site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Sysinternals or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using the Site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. Sysinternals abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. 

##  Control of Your Personal Information

Except as otherwise described in this statement, personal information you provide on the Site will not be shared outside of Sysinternals and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your permission. 

If you would like to update your contact preferences, please contact us by [clicking here](mailto:customerservice@winternals.com). You may also stop the delivery of future email newsletters or marketing messages by following the specific instructions in the email you receive. 

Please be aware that this privacy statement and any choices you make on the Site will not necessarily apply to personal information you may have provided to Sysinternals or its subsidiaries and affiliates in the context of other, separately operated, products or services offered by Sysinternals or its subsidiaries and affiliates. 

##  Access to Your Personal Information

You can review and edit the personal information you have provided in your optional public areas profile by following the instructions in the "Public Areas" section of this statement. You can access and request that we update the personal information you have otherwise provided at the Site, if any, by contacting us using the methods described at the bottom of this statement. 

##  Security of Your Personal Information

Sysinternals is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. Additionally, when we transmit sensitive personal information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. 

##  Use of Cookies 

We use cookies on this Site to ensure the integrity of the registration process and to personalize the Site. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. 

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of delivering relevant content, eases site navigation, and so on. When you return to the web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the site's features that you customized. 

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually choose to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to use interactive features of this or other web sites that depend on cookies. 

##  Public Areas

To use the forums, chat rooms and other public areas on the Site, we request that you create a social nickname which is the name you will be known by to others in public areas. It is also possible to create an optional profile for public areas during registration. In your profile, you may include such information as your name, location, homepage, interests, messaging user names, and an avatar. All such information is optional and, while you may choose to hide your email address from other users of public areas, everything you enter in your profile will otherwise be visible to other users of public areas on the Site. We urge you to be careful only to enter information on your profile that you are comfortable sharing with the public at large. You may edit, delete, or modify information in your profile at any time by logging in to the Site's public areas and navigating to the "Member Control Panel Menu." 

##  Changes to this Privacy Statement

We may occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy statement. For material changes to this privacy statement, we will notify you either by placing a prominent notice on the home page of our web site or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this privacy statement to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. Your continued use of the service constitutes your agreement to this privacy statement and any updates.
