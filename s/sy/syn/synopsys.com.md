Synopsys Privacy Policy

**_Synopsys is committed to protecting your online privacy on our website. The privacy practices described in this Privacy Policy apply to synopsys.com and to all of our websites and wholly owned subsidiary websites._**

We strive to treat your personal information as safely and securely as reasonably possible. Please read the following privacy policy to better understand how your personal information may be collected and used as you access various areas of our website. 

As described below, your information may be collected by Synopsys, Inc. (“Synopsys”), disclosed to third parties, and used by third parties and Synopsys. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect about you and what may happen to that information. Some of the reasons why we collect your personal information include: 

  * Register to access certain parts of the site
  * Register to subscribe to newsletters 
  * Participate in discussion forums 
  * Provide registered users a more personalized and meaningful experience on the Synopsys website



We occasionally employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, and processing credit card payments. These third party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. We do not sell, rent, share, or otherwise disclose personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes.

**Collection of Personally Identifiable Information**

**REGISTRATION**  
In order to use certain protected areas of this website, such as SolvNet® support, DesignWare® Download Request, or to request a white paper, you first must complete a registration form and/or create a user name and password. During registration you are required to give contact information (such as name and email address). We may use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest. This information may also be shared with Synopsys subsidiaries and business partners. 

**APPLICATION FORMS**  
If you submit your resume online for a job opening, we require that you provide certain personally identifiable information, including your name, address, phone number, and employment and education history. This information is necessary to process your application and to contact you.

**SURVEYS OR CONTESTS**  
From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). 

We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, and sometimes to send participants an email newsletter if requested.

In some cases, we may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; any such provider is prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose.

**“EMAIL THIS ARTICLE” REFERRALS**  
If you choose to use the “Email this article” function (on web pages where it is available) in order to send another person the article, we will ask you for the recipient’s email address and your email address. We will automatically send the recipient a one-time email that includes a text-only version of the article. Synopsys does not store this personally identifiable information after sending the one-time email.

**Collection of Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

**LOG FILES**  
As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, and date/time stamp. 

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. This information is used to better understand and improve the usability, performance and effectiveness of Synopsys websites.

We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.

**COOKIES**  
Some Synopsys web pages use "cookies," which are small files saved on your computer. Cookies help us recognize your user preferences and can improve your future web visits, but they do not allow us to identify who you are. You can set your web browser to notify you when you are receiving a cookie and choose to reject it. However, rejecting cookies may affect the performance of the Synopsys web site and prevent you from accessing certain Synopsys information.

**Communications**

**SPECIAL OFFERS AND UPDATES**  
We may occasionally send you information on products, services, and training or events that might be of interest to you.

Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see the “Choice and Opt-out.” 

**NEWSLETTERS**  
If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. Please see the “Choice and Opt-out” section.

**SERVICE-RELATED ANNOUNCEMENTS**  
We may send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if you are a customer and we have a support announcement related to the product you are using, we might send you an email. 

Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

**PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION:**  
We occasionally share personally identifiable information with third parties acting as either agents or service providers acting on our behalf.

**AGENTS & SERVICE PROVIDERS **  
We use an outside shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for services. We use other third parties to provide certain specific services on our site, such as discussion forums and registration for certain classes and events. 

When you sign up for these particular services, we may share your personal information as necessary with authorized third party agents or contractors in order to provide the requested service or transaction. For example, if we need to ship something to you, we must share your name and address with a shipping company. 

We only provide third party agents and service providers with the minimum amount of personal information necessary to complete the requested service or transaction. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.

**LEGAL DISCLAIMER**  
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.

**LINKS TO OTHER SITES**  
This website contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Synopsys. Please be aware that we, Synopsys, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. 

When you leave our site, we encourage you to be aware and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. 

This privacy statement applies only to information collected by Synopsys websites. 

**DISCUSSION FORUMS**  
If you use a discussion forum on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.

**Security**

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). 

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we may post those changes to the privacy policy URL, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we may notify you here or by means of a notice on our home page.
