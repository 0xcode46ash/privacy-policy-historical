 **Tracking Technologies / Cookies**

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. However, we do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. Session cookies are temporary cookie files, which get erased when you close your browser. Since WebPages have no memories, when the user logs in to the web site a new session cookie will be generated, which will store the users’ browsing information and will be active until the user leaves the site and closes the browser. Once closed these cookies are automatically deleted.

When the user restarts the browser and goes back to the site that had created the cookie, the website will not recognize the user. The user will have to log back in (if login is required). A user going from page to page will be treated by the website as a completely new visitor. A Session cookies tracks visitor behavior from page to page so the visitors don't get asked for the same information they had already given to the site. A session cookies allows users to proceed through many pages of a site quickly and easily without having to authenticate or reprocess each new area they visit. We are not using the information stored in session cookies for any other purpose nor are these shared with third party tools or websites.

A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. These files stay in one of the browser's subfolders until these are deleted manually or the browser deletes them based on the duration period contained within the persistent cookies files. Persistent cookies help websites remember user information and settings when they visit them in the future. This results in faster and more convenient browsing since last visit.  Some of the features made possible by persistent cookies include: language selection, theme selection, menu preferences, internal site bookmarks or favorites, among many others. A persistent cookie enables a website to remember user on subsequent visits, speeding up or enhancing user experience of services or functions offered by the website. We are not using the information stored in persistent cookies for any purpose nor are these shared with third party tools or websites. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” directory. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited.

 **Web Beacons / Gifs**

3rd party tracking technologies on our site may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons) that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We are using analytics programs such as Google Analytics and Pardot. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our visitor’s personally identifiable information. This information is used only for Analytical purpose.

 **Analytics / Log Files**

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically through analytics programs such as Google Analytics and Pardot, and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

 **3rd Party Tracking**

The use of tracking technologies by our service providers, technology partners or other 3rd party assets (such as Google Analytics and Pardot) on the site is not covered by our privacy policy. These 3rd parties may use cookies, clear gifs, images, and scripts to help them better manage their content on our site. We do not have access or control over these technologies. We do not tie the information gathered to our Customers’ or Users’ personally identifiable information.

 **Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting**

We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites.  Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.  If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by [clicking here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp "Unsubscribe"). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.
