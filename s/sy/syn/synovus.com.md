Our most important asset is our customers’ trust. Keeping customer information secure and using it only as our customers would want us to is a top priority for us.

**Here is our covenant to you, our customer:**

  1. We have never sold and will never sell information about you to anyone for any reason.
  2. We will safeguard, according to strict standards of security and confidentiality, any information you provide to us.
  3. We will limit the collection and use of your information to the minimum required to deliver superior service. This includes the chance for us to design and offer you specific products, services and other opportunities that would benefit you.
  4. We will permit only authorized team members who are trained in the proper handling of customer information to have access to your information. This means only team members who need to know information to provide products and services to you will be allowed access.
  5. We will tell you in plain language, initially and at least once every year while you are a customer, what information we collect from you, where we obtain that information and how we plan to use it. As discussed later, you have several choices (which you may select at any time) on how you would like for us to manage your information.
  6. In addition to restricting access to customer information, we also maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable legal standards to keep your information private and secure.
  7. We will not use or disclose --- internally or externally – personally identifiable medical information for any purpose other than underwriting or administration of your insurance policy, claim or account, or as disclosed to you when the information is collected, or to which you consent.
  8. We will always maintain control over the confidentiality of information; even on those occasions when we allow offers to be made from reputable outside companies.
  9. Whenever we hire other organizations to provide support services, we will require them to conform to our privacy requirements and to allow us to audit them for compliance.
  10. For purposes of credit reporting, verification and risk management, we will exchange information about you with reputable reference sources and clearing house services.



**We care about your privacy.**

Guarding our customers’ privacy has always been one of our highest priorities. In order to protect you, the information we maintain about your relationship with us helps us identify you and prevent unauthorized persons from getting information about you or your accounts.

We are also dedicated to serving your needs. One way we do this is by providing you with information that may help you manage your finances; for example, the availability of new or upgraded products and services and special offers such as credit line increases or rates which are being promoted for a limited time. We believe communicating these opportunities can result in advantages for you such as:

  * Increased convenience
  * Improved personalized service
  * Real savings of time and money



**In order to deliver these benefits to you, we may need to disclose the information we collect about you (as described below). Therefore, we want you to understand what information we collect and how it is used.**

**We collect and disclose only information that is necessary to serve you and administer our business.**

In the process of serving you, we obtain certain "non-public personal information" --- information about you that is not available publicly. This information comes to us from a variety of sources, including:

  * Information you provide directly to us on applications, other forms or otherwise (such as Social Security Number, assets and income).   
 
  * Information related to your transactions with us (such as account balance, payment history, and credit card usage) or with others.   
 
  * Information we receive from third parties (such as consumer reporting agencies or credit or employment references).  
 
  * Information obtained at your request (such as aggregated information from multiple financial providers for the purpose of developing a financial profile or plan for you).



We limit the collection and use of this information to that which is needed to administer our business and to provide superior service to you.

How we use information about you:

  * For identification purposes to protect your accounts and guard against unauthorized access.  
 
  * To better serve you and to identify additional products and services that may help meet your needs or that will result in added savings or convenience to you.  
 
  * Only in accordance with the principles stated in this covenant.



Additional information about disclosures:

Additionally, we may disclose non-public personal information we collect as described above as permitted or required by law to non-affiliated third parties who perform administrative functions on our behalf such as processing your accounts or preparing your account statements. We may also disclose this non-public personal information to non-affiliated third parties where necessary to conduct business, such as companies performing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements. We will not, however, sell or provide your information to telemarketing companies for their independent use.

**Your choices regarding information disclosure**

We are committed to protecting your information and to using it in ways that will improve our service to you. We also want you to know that you have choices about how your information may be disclosed.

**If you are comfortable with the promises that are discussed in this covenant and will allow us to exchange information about you as outlined, then you do not need to contact us.**

If you would prefer to limit disclosure of your information, please see the options below.

_**Option 1:** Do Not Disclose With Outside Companies_

We may disclose non-public personal information about you with companies not part of our corporate family. Examples of such organizations would be companies for whom we issue private label or affinity credit cards and financial services providers such as insurance companies or non-financial companies with whom we have formed an alliance to provide special services to our customers; such as airlines, publishers, retailers.

_If you prefer that this information about you **not** be disclosed with non-affiliated third parties (other than as permitted or required by law), you must notify us by calling the following toll-free number: 1 (800) 695-0987 --- and selecting Option 1. Choosing this option would still allow us to disclose within the Synovus family of companies described below._

**If disclosure of this information is permissible, you do not need to contact us.**

_**Option 2:** Do Not Disclose Within the Synovus Family of Companies_  
(to include the companies listed in this notice, Synovus Trust Companies and companies who may join us in the future)

It is possible that the banks and other financial service provider companies (such as mortgage, securities and insurance companies) within our Synovus family would exchange the information we collect about you (as described above) among themselves for the purposes listed above. Our trust companies would participate only on a limited basis, primarily receiving information.

_If you prefer that this information **not** be disclosed with companies in our corporate family, you must notify us by calling the following toll-free number: 1 (800) 695-0987 --- and selecting Option 2\. Choosing this option still allows us to disclose with non-affiliated third parties discussed above. Also, even though you have selected this option, there is certain information such as your transactions and our experiences with you that we may share as permitted by law._

**If disclosure of this information is permissible, you do not need to contact us.**

_**Option 3** : Do Not Disclose With Either the Synovus Family or Outside Companies_

_As outlined in Options 1 and 2, if you prefer that information about you **not** be disclosed with banks or companies within the Synovus family nor with non-affiliated third parties (other than as permitted or required by law), you must notify us by calling the following toll-free number: 1 (800) 695-0987 --- and selecting Option 3._

**If disclosure of this information is permissible, you do not need to contact us.**

_Additional information about your choices_

As you can see, you have choices about our disclosure of information about you.

  * You may choose to allow us to exchange such information (under strict confidentiality standards). If you choose this option, **you don’t need to do anything**.

You could also choose to allow us to disclose information within our corporate family while choosing not to allow us to disclose with companies outside our corporation. (Your selection in this example would be Option 1.)

  * Once your request has been processed, it will remain in effect until you request a change. You may request a change at any time throughout the year by calling us toll-free at 1 (800) 695-0987 and selecting the option that reflects your choice.  
 
  * If a joint account customer chooses not to allow disclosure of this information, that decision will apply to the entire joint account.  
 
  * In order to protect your choice and to maximize our ability to administer your choice, the toll-free telephone number will be the only authorized means to inform us of your decision not to disclose information.



If at any time you become an inactive customer or close your account(s), we will continue to adhere to the privacy policies and practices described in this notice.

Our commitment to you is to handle your financial matters with discretion, treating them as if they were our own. If you have any questions regarding our privacy policies or procedures, please contact the compliance officer of the appropriate Synovus company where you are a customer. (Please note: if you are a customer of more than one Synovus company or if you have multiple accounts with us, you may receive more than one notice.)

Please note: Third parties may have access to information related to our customers that has been obtained independently from us (for example: through credit rating agencies or public real estate records). Mailings or solicitations based on this information are not within our control.

March 2001. This covenant supercedes any previous privacy statement issued.
