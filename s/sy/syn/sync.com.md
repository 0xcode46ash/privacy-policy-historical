# Sync | Securely store all your sensitive files with Sync.com

[Terms of Service](http://www.sync.com/terms "Terms of Service") | [Privacy Policy](http://www.sync.com/privacy-policy "Privacy Policy")

## At Sync.com, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy lets you know when and how Sync.com uses, collects or discloses your personal information. 

Personal information is information that can be used to identify or contact you individually, and other information that Sync.com needs to provide you with the products and services you have requested. Personal information typically includes your name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number and credit card or payment information. Under certain circumstances, an IP address may be considered personal information. Personal information does not include contact information about a person in their business capacity, such as the name, title, business address, or telephone number of an employee of an organization.

Sync.com has 10 Privacy Principles, based on those established in Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, or PIPEDA. Sync.com has implemented policies and practices to give effect to these principles. Sync.com has implemented procedures to protect personal information, has established procedures to receive and respond to complaints and inquiries, has trained its staff and communicated to them information about Sync.com’s policies and practices, and has developed information explaining Sync.com’s policies and procedures. This Privacy Policy tells you about how Sync.com’s policies and procedures comport with each of these Principles. 

## Principle 1 — Accountability

Sync.com is responsible for personal information under its control. Sync.com has designated a Privacy Officer who is accountable for its compliance with our Privacy Policy and PIPEDA. Sync.com’s Privacy Officer is accountable for our compliance with PIPEDA, but other individuals at Sync.com may be responsible for day-to-day collection and processing of personal information and may also be delegated to act on behalf of the Privacy Officer.

Sync.com may on occasion use outside companies, called third parties, to help us provide our products or services to you. Regardless of where these third parties are located, we require that they also comply with PIPEDA and with Sync.com’s Privacy Principles. 

## Principle 2 — Identifying Purposes

You have a right to know how your information will be used. Sync.com will explain why we need your information before or when we collect it, if the purpose is not already clear. We will assume that the purpose is clearly identified when we use your personal information to: Provide you with the products or services you have requested; Process your payment, including recurring payments as you request; Communicate with you about the products or services you have requested; Ensure that you are properly registered to use our products and services and to receive any associated technical support; and Inform you of any important product revisions or updates. Sync.com will also collect log information that includes your IP address and the time that you access our service. This information is stored in log files and is used for security, to improve performance and for aggregated and statistical reporting. This log information is not linked to personal information gathered elsewhere on the site. Sync.com may also use your personal information for secondary purposes such as:

  * Letting you know about new or upgraded Sync.com products and services; and
  * Inviting you to participate in customer surveys or other opinion- gathering devices.



Aggregate data is general information about groups of customers, and does not identify individual customers. Sync.com may combine your information with that of other customers to generate aggregate data that can be used to improve our products and services or develop new ones. For example, we may tell a third party how many users have subscribed to a particular service, but not identify that you personally are a subscriber. 

  * As is reasonably required to fulfill your service or product requirements, provided such third parties shall be bound to appropriate privacy requirements;
  * To comply with a legal process such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena, court order or law enforcement request;
  * To resolve a contractual dispute regarding your use of any Sync.com product or service;
  * To resolve issues related to the use of your account for illegal activities; or
  * To protect the personal safety of other users or members of the public in an emergency.



## Principle 3 — Consent

Sync.com will collect, use and disclose your personal information only with your knowledge and consent, except where permitted or as required by law. We will not rent, sell, or otherwise distribute your personal information without your permission. Where appropriate, Sync.com will generally seek consent for the use or disclosure of the information at the time of collection. In certain circumstances, consent with respect to use or disclosure may be sought after the information has been collected but before use (for example, when Sync.com wants to use information for a purpose other than those identified above). Sync.com will seek consent when the information is likely to be considered sensitive. Implied consent will generally be appropriate where the information is less sensitive or where it can be reasonably inferred that you are consenting to the use and disclosure of personal information for certain purposes. 

You control any future secondary use of your personal information, such as sharing it with marketers. You can prevent future secondary use of your information by “opting out” when Sync.com collects your information or at any time by simply contacting us. Opting out only applies to the secondary purposes because we may need to contact you regarding the usability of our services or notify you of important product revisions or updates. To change your privacy preferences, please go to www.sync.com and log into your account.

## Principle 4 — Limiting Collection

Sync.com will collect personal information only for the purposes we’ve identified or for the primary uses described above. We shall collect information by fair and lawful means only. We will collect personal information in the following circumstances:

  * When you subscribe to use our services, whether free or through a paid subscription;
  * When you provide payment information for use with a paid subscription;
  * When you contact Sync.com to request information;
  * When we are provided such information from a third party who you authorized to share such information.



We will mark as optional any question we ask that seeks information that is not necessary to provide you with the Sync.com product or service you request. 

Sync.com uses “cookies” to collect information and improve our products and services. A cookie is a small data file that is stored on your device. Cookies cannot be used to see any other data on your computer, nor can they determine your e-mail address or identity. We may use “persistent cookies” to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to our service. We may use “session cookies” to enable certain features of our service, to better understand how you interact with our service and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our service.

Those cookies may be used to track your involvement with the advertising site. You may choose not to accept these cookies. Sync.com does not control these parties, and you should review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use personal information. 

## Principle 5 — Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention

Sync.com will not use or disclose your personal information other than for the purposes for which it was collected unless we receive your consent or unless we are required or permitted to by law. The content of the files that you store on our service is encrypted and only You can decrypt it. When providing information in response to a legal inquiry or order, we will verify its validity and disclose only the information that is legally required. Sync.com will make reasonable efforts, within the bounds of the law, to notify you should your personal information be subject to disclosure.

Sync.com will keep your personal information only for as long as it needs to for the purposes identified above, as required by law, or as necessary to resolve any disputes you may have concerning our services. Sync.com will follow internally set guidelines and use care in the disposal, destruction, or de-identification of personal information to prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to such information.

## Principle 6 — Accuracy

Sync.com will maintain accurate, complete and up-to-date personal information as required for the identified purposes associated with its collection. Please let Sync.com know if your contact or other personal information changes. To update your personal information, please go to www.sync.com and log into your account. 

## Principle 7 — Safeguards

Sync.com protects the personal information in our possession and control by using security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information. We work to protect personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration using industry-recognized security safeguards. We restrict internal access to personal information to select members of our team.

Sync.com maintains procedures for addressing and responding to all inquiries or complaints from its customers about Sync.com’s handling of personal information.
