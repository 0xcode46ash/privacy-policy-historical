# Sync.ME - Magically update your contacts

Last modified by September 2, 2013

Sync.ME understands you want to keep certain information private, and, consequentially, we have drafted the following privacy policy (the " **Privacy Policy** ") to ensures that you are aware of the type of information collected by us and, by using the Service, the uses that you permit us to make of such information.   
This Policy is designed to help you decide whether to use the Service and in what manner, by outlining the restrictions we take upon ourselves in gathering, storing and using your information.   
This Policy is incorporated into, subject to and a part of the Terms of Use. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, you may not and should not use the Service. The definitions in the Terms of Use apply to this Privacy Policy.

 _ **Information Gathered from Users**_

Sync.ME gathers information mainly to provide, maintain and improve the Service. Because the purpose of Service is to synchronize between your Contacts and such Contacts Profiles and to synchronize your Profile (or Sync.ME Card, if applicable) and your Contact’s Profiles with other end users’ Contacts list we must gain access to certain information regarding you and regarding your Contacts.

  
With respect to you and your Contacts, Sync.ME may access and store a name, phone number and Sync.Me may also access your Profile, including your Profile name, Profile picture (or link thereto, if retrieving and storing the images are prohibited by law or by the terms of service of the applicable Approved Platform), e-mail, birthday, status, notes and information your friends on such Approved Platform have made available to you.

  
_**Logs**_

As most sites do, Sync.ME systems may automatically record and store technical information regarding the method and nature of your use of the Service including your requests, actions, referred and exit pages, pages visited, use time, IP, platform type, operating system information, number of clicks, browser information, social network user ID number and relevant cookies. 

_**Cookies Information**_

Sync.ME's systems may automatically send cookies to your system. Sync.ME may store information which correlates with those cookies, and designed to improve and optimize the Service.   
You may block and remove Sync.ME's cookies through your browser and operating system, but this may impair and hinder the Service functionality and availability.

Sync.ME may use logs and cookie information to improve quality and design of the Service, including without limitation, saving you the trouble of re-entering data, and quarries, personalize and customize the Service, track your use of the Service and generate statistics regarding the Service.

 _ **No Obligation to Store Information**_

Nothing in this Policy is interpreted as an obligation to store information, and Sync.ME may, at its own discretion, delete or avoid from recording and storing any and all information.   
You shall have no claim against Sync.ME for deleting information, avoiding from retrieving and storing or not complying with any information request, including court orders and warrant by authorized entities, because the requested information was deleted or not stored by Sync.ME and is unavailable to it. 

_**How Does Sync.ME Use Information**_

Sync.ME may use the information it gathers to provide, maintain, operate and improve the Service. Sync.ME may also use the information it gathers to synchronize other Sync.ME users' contact lists.

Sync.ME may transfer information it collects in accordance with the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy to third parties subject to such terms and conditions deemed appropriate by Sync.Me. You may elect to opt-out and have your personal information removed by sending an e-mail to [support@sync.me](mailto:support@sync.me) stating your full name, telephone number and a links to each of your applicable Profiles, and a clear and unequivocal request to have your information removed from the Service.

_**Non-Restricted Information Disclosure**_

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated herein, Sync.ME may:  
\- Disclose non identifiable information (information which does not and cannot be attributed to a specific user) to third parties who have an interest in the Service, its functionality and its usage patterns;   
\- Disclose information to third parties as part of a specific program to which you will have the ability to opt-in;  
\- Disclose any information if Sync.ME is required to do so by law or to aid a law enforcement agency in the prevention of a crime;

_**Removal and Correcting Information**_

If you have any privacy concerns or issues, or if you would like Sync.ME to delete or change information regarding your personal profile, Sync.ME's data storage and other users' smartphones, please contact us via e-mail at: **support@sync.me**

 _ **Information Warranty Disclaimer**_

Notwithstanding anything else in this Policy, Sync.ME is not responsible for the accuracy, correctness and security of any of the information it gathers, stores and disclose to you or to anyone else. 

_**Contact via your Profile**_

Sync.ME may offer a contact service, allowing third parties to connect with you through the Service (the Contact Service). The Contact Service will allow a user of the App to place a phone call to your smartphone.   
The Contact Service is an OPT-IN SERVICE, and you will be asked if you want other parties (including those who do not know your phone number) to be able to contact you through the Contact Service. i.e., the default option is NOT to contact you directly, unless you explicitly indicate otherwise.   
Your phone number will NOT be disclosed to any Contact Service user and the phone line will be connected through a secure proxy operated by Sync.ME or on its behalf.  
If you believe a third party is abusing this feature, please file an abuse report as directed in the Terms of Use.

 _ **Third Party Advertisements**_

Sync.ME may use advertisements to fund the Service, which may be placed, served, managed, operated and distributed by third parties (specialized ad industry companies) within the Service.  
Aside from non-identifiable information supplied to them, these third party companies use designated technologies (including cookies) which are not under the control or knowledge of Sync.ME, in order to measure, improve and personalize their ad activity and effectiveness. 

_**Data Security**_

Sync.ME places great emphasis on the security and integrity of your information and the data stored in Sync.ME's systems.   
The Service is provided under the best commercially reasonable data security practices, in order to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or deletion of any and all information stored in Sync.ME's systems.  
You acknowledge, however, that no such effort can completely guarantee the security of the stored data, that breaches of security are still a possibility both regarding Sync.ME's systems and that a data security breach resulting in unauthorized access to your information can occur in third party system (for example, ISP's and hosting services providers).   
As a result, Sync.ME does NOT warrant or ensure the integrity and security of the data stored in its systems, including without limitation your information.   
Sync.ME shall make reasonable efforts to notify any user whose information is suspected of being accessed, disclosed, altered or deleted by an unauthorized person, so that he can take appropriate measure to minimize the adverse effect of such a data security breach (Breach Notification). Sync.ME will make reasonable efforts to give such Breach Notification soon after Sync.ME learns of said breach, unless Sync.ME deems, at its sole discretion, that such Notification might hinder and prevent ongoing efforts to detect the source of the breach.  
For the avoidance of doubt, a Breach Notification does NOT constitute an admission by Sync.ME that the breach occurred as a result of malpractice, failure, bad faith or negligence on behalf of Sync.ME or that the breach even occurred in Sync.ME's systems. 

_**Change of Ownership**_

In the event of a change of ownership or control of all or part of Sync.ME, including without limitation through acquisition, merger or sale, Sync.ME reserves the right to transfer all or part of the personal information it stores in its systems.  
You acknowledge that in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership, Sync.ME may have no control over the use and transfer of your personal information.

 _ **Governing Law and Jurisdiction**_

This Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Israel, without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. Any dispute arising under or in relation to this Policy shall be resolved in accordance with the terms and procedures set forth in the Terms of Use [INSERT LINK].

_**Changes to this Privacy Policy**_

This Policy may be revised from time to time at Sync.ME's sole discretion. The last revision will be reflected in the "Last modified by" heading above. Please visit this page periodically for updates. Continuing to use the Service continues your acceptance of changes.
