# Privacy Policy : Syncfusion

Last Updated on: 03/16/2010

At Syncfusion, Inc., your privacy is very important to us. This document sets forth the Syncfusion Online Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") for this Web site, www.syncfusion.com (the "Site"). If you have objections to the Privacy Policy, you should not access or use this Site. You can browse through most of our website without giving us any information about yourself, but there are certain areas of our site, for example the online technical support area, for which we do need information from you. We, therefore, encourage you take a moment to read our online privacy policy. 

#### Defining Personal information

Personal Information 

"Personal Information" is defined as any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains. This includes first and last name, mailing address (including ZIP code), e-mail address, employer, job title and department, telephone and facsimile numbers. When ordering products or services on the Site, you may be asked to provide a credit card number. 

Technical Information 

When you use the Site, Syncfusion or third parties authorized by Syncfusion may also collect certain technical and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of the Site and its services. For example, we may log environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, and the Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your computer. We use these environmental variables to facilitate and track your use of the Site and its services. Syncfusion also uses such environmental variables to measure traffic patterns on the Site. Without expressly informing you in each particular circumstance, we do not match such information with any of your Personal Information.

Cookies

When you visit this Site, you can browse the Site and access important information without revealing your identity. In order to improve our Site, we use "cookies" to track your visit. A cookie is a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a Web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as an identification card for your web browser, and it enables Syncfusion to record your passwords, purchases, and preferences. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it. (For some Web pages that require an authorization, cookies are not optional, as the authorization information is stored in the cookie. Users choosing not to accept cookies will probably not be able to access those pages.) While Syncfusion uses cookies to track your visit to the Site, and our Web servers automatically log the IP/Internet address of your computer, Syncfusion does not use this information to identify you personally. 

#### Collecting Personal information 

Who collects it 

Personal Information on this Site is collected by Syncfusion, Inc. Syncfusion's address is 2501 Aerial Center Parkway, Suite 200, Morrisville, NC 27560, and its telephone number is (919) 481-1974.

The Site contains links to other Web sites at which Personal Information may be collected. In such instances, unless expressly provided to the contrary, the collection and use of your Personal Information will be governed by the privacy policy applicable to that site. That privacy policy should identify the entity that is collecting your Personal Information. 

When and how is Personal Information collected 

Syncfusion collects your information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select. If you subscribe to a service or register a product, for example, the information is used to register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made available to registered users. As another example, if you enter a contest, information is collected to qualify the entry and contact you regarding the contest or prize awards. Your Personal Information is also used to keep you informed about product upgrades, special offers, and other products and services of Syncfusion.

Syncfusion may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity. 

####  Using Personal Information 

Who uses it and how 

Syncfusion uses your personal information to: 

  * Make it easier for you to use the areas of our site, like the technical support area. 
  * Enable you to track the status of your technical support incidents. 
  * Enable you to post messages in our technical support forums. 
  * Help us maintain and retrieve information regarding the status of your product or subscription. 
  * Send you information regarding product updates and special offers if you have signed up for these. 
  * If you are a customer we will send you information on product updates. If you use our support system we will send you e-mail updates when your incident has been updated by our support personnel.
  * If you sign up to receive updates from our site, you will be requested by email for confirmation of such requests. Only if you confirm the request will it be treated as valid. 



####  Protection and access to collected information 

How is the collected information protected? 

The Personal Information that you provide in connection with registering yourself as a user of Syncfusion products or services or registering a Syncfusion product is classified as Registration Information. Registration Information is protected in several ways. Access by you to your Registration Information is available through a password and unique customer ID selected by you. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. In addition, your Registration Information resides on a secure server that only selected Syncfusion personnel and contractors have access to via password. Syncfusion encrypts your Personal Information and thereby strives to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is transmitted to Syncfusion. 

Personal Information that you provide that does not constitute Registration Information also resides on a secure server and is only accessible to selected Syncfusion personnel and contractors via password. Since this information is not accessible by you, you will not be asked to select a password in order to view or modify such information. Within Syncfusion, only authorized support personnel and executives have access to your Personal Information. 

Please note that any information you post to a public bulletin board or chat room, such as the Syncfusion User to User Forums (the "Forums"), is available to all persons accessing that location. Your e-mail address would then be available to all persons accessing the Forums. 

Syncfusion recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information collected on this Site. Without your consent, Syncfusion will not communicate any information to you regarding products, services, and special offers available from Syncfusion, although we may find it necessary to communicate with you regarding your use of the services on this Site. Except in the particular circumstances described in this Privacy Policy, Syncfusion will also not provide your name to other companies or organizations without your consent. 

There are instances in which Syncfusion will be compelled to divulge your Personal Information. Syncfusion may provide your Personal Information if necessary, in Syncfusion's good faith judgment, to comply with laws or regulations of a governmental or regulatory body or in response to a valid subpoena, warrant, or order or to protect the rights of Syncfusion or others. 

####  Updating your personal information and privacy preferences

You have the right to access and correct your personal information and privacy preferences at any time. 

  * Update information you have submitted to us. Simply login into our support system at <http://www.syncfusion.com/support/> and select the 'Edit My Account' option.

####  Changes in Privacy Policy 

All "Personal Information" that we collect and maintain will be subject to the version of the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of such collection.

However, if Syncfusion sells its business assets or operations (or the assets of a division or subsidiary of Syncfusion) to another entity, or Syncfusion (or a division or subsidiary) is acquired by or merged with another entity, Syncfusion may provide to such entity customer information that is related to that part of our business that was sold to or merged with the other entity without your consent 

####  Notification of Changes
