At Syncfusion Inc, your privacy is very important to us. This document sets forth the Syncfusion Online Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") for this Web site, www.syncfusion.com (the "Site"). If you have objections to the Privacy Policy, you should not access or use this Site. You can browse through most of our website without giving us any information about yourself. But there are certain areas of our site, for example the online technical support area, for which we do need information from you. We therefore encourage you take a moment to read our online privacy policy.

## Defining Personal information

#### Personal Information

"Personal information" is defined as any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains such as first and last name, mailing address (including ZIP code), e-mail address, employer, job title and department, telephone and facsimile numbers. When ordering products or services on the Site, you may be asked to provide a credit card number. 

#### Technical Information

When you use the Site, Syncfusion or third parties authorized by Syncfusion may also collect certain technical and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of the Site and its services. For example, we may log environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, and the Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your computer. We use these environmental variables to facilitate and track your use of the Site and its services. Syncfusion also uses such environmental variables to measure traffic patterns on the Site. Without expressly informing you in each particular circumstance, we do not match such information with any of your personal information.

#### Cookies

When you visit this Site, you can browse the Site and access important information without revealing your identity. In order to improve our Site, we use "cookies" to track your visit. A cookie is a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a Web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your identification card, and enables Syncfusion to record your passwords, purchases, and preferences. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. (For some Web pages that require an authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept cookies will probably not be able to access those pages.) While Syncfusion uses cookies to track your visit to Syncfusion.com, and our Web servers automatically log the IP/Internet address of your computer, Syncfusion does not use this information to identify you personally.

The Site contains links to other sites at which personal information is collected. In such instances, unless expressly provided to the contrary, the collection and use of your personal information will be governed by the privacy policy applicable to that site. That privacy policy should identify the entity that is collecting your personal information. 

#### When and how is Personal Information collected

If you subscribe to a service or register a product, for example, the information is used to register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made available to registered users.

Your personal information is also used to keep you informed about product upgrades, special offers, and other products and services of Syncfusion. 

Syncfusion may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.
