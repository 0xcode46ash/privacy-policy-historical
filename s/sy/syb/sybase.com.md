We also want to tell you how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the information. 

Finally, please note that this policy applies only to the online collection of data obtained on [www.sybase.com](http://www.sybase.com/) and not to other companies' or organizations' Web sites to which we link. This Web site does contain links to other sites. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are clicking to another Web site. Sybase is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such Web sites. 

We encourage you to read the privacy statements of these sites as their privacy statement may differ from ours. Please keep in mind that some of the products or services mentioned specifically in this policy might not be available on all of our international Sybase sites at this time. 

By creating an account with MySybase, or by registering for events, promotions, training classes, product evaluations etc. or by using the Sybase.com/MySybase Web site, you thereby grant your consent to the processing of your personal data in accordance with this policy.

**This policy will let you know:**

1\. What personally identifiable information is collected from you;   
2\. What cookies are and how they are used;   
3\. With whom your information may be shared;   
4\. How Sybase uses the personally identifiable information that has been collected;   
5\. Which 'opt out' options you have as a www.sybase.com user;   
6\. The kind of security precautions that are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information;

**** 1\. What personally identifiable information does Sybase collect from you?

Certain activities on our Web site require the collection of personally identifiable information. Typically, we will collect only your name, company name, email address and other contact information such as phone and fax numbers. When you make a purchase, we will also collect your credit card, billing and shipping information. 

We may also ask you for your interests and preferences to customize your future visits to our Web site. Sybase collects information in several ways from different parts of the Sybase.com Web site. These include: 

1\. Trial, evaluation and beta download registration   
2\. Event registration   
3\. Support registration   
4\. Education registration   
5\. Online purchases   
6\. Contest registration   
7\. Subscription registration for sites that require subscription   
8\. Contact us   
9\. MySybase registration 

If you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still visit most of Sybase Web site, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, downloads, and services. 

Any newsgroup that begins with Sybase.public or Powersoft.public is a newsgroup that is actively monitored by Sybase. Disclosing personally identifiable information online through chat rooms, forums, and message boards makes the information submitted public information. Such disclosure may increase your chance of receiving "spam" or unsolicited mail. Be extra careful and use your discretion when disclosing information online. 

If you choose to use the 'Email this' feature included in certain sybase.com pages to refer articles to other users, we will ask you for the recipient's name and email address. The system will then send an email to the recipient automatically with a link back to the article. Sybase does not store this information, which is needed for the sole purpose of sending a one-time email to the person you designate. 

**** 2\. What cookies are and how they are used

What are cookies? Cookies are used for setting a key on a user's browser that links him/her to the current state of their Web session. Their purpose is to let us know when you visit our site, where you visit in the site, and save preferences you set. Your browser can be set to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. If you choose not to accept cookies, you may not have access to certain functionality on our site. Site functionality requiring a login will utilize cookies. As a result, if you would like to visit the logged in portion of the sybase.com site, you will need to accept cookies. 

We want to be sure you understand that accepting a cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any personal information about you. We know that a lot of people have concerns about cookies, but in talking with many of our users we feel that the benefit we both gain from their proper use is worthwhile. We value the relationships we have with our customers and future customers, so we respect these concerns.

Sybase also tracks IP addresses of Web sites from which you may visit www.sybase.com to analyze the data for trends and statistics reporting. In a few cases, specifically when you respond to e-mail marketing campaigns generated by third party vendors, your IP address may be associated via the usage of web beacons with some of your user information to monitor clickstream paths when you browse www.sybase.com, even if you are not logged into MySybase, the personalized area of the Web site.

**** 3\. With whom your information may be shared

** Service Providers**   
We sometimes hire companies (Service providers) to provide services on our behalf. Service providers may provide mailing and event registration information or technical support information to you. We will only provide such service providers the information they need to deliver the services and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. 

On occasion, Sybase uses Web site framing techniques, linking you to another service provider's Web site that retains the look and feel and navigation of www.sybase.com. This practice is used simply to aid you to easily navigate back to www.sybase.com. When framing occurs, the URL in your browser's toolbar will no longer display the www.sybase.com address, but the Web site address of the service provider in question.

** Companies Offering Promotions **   
From time to time, a Sybase business partner may wish to offer promotions. Sybase and its partners may engage in events or provide bundled products. In those instances, we will share your information with that partner. Such promotions such as joint seminars and sales promotions, jointly developed products, and joint announcements will always reference the partners involved. Both Sybase and its partner(s) will have access to information submitted by users who have expressed interest in marketing promotions. While we carefully choose our partners, we do advise you to review the privacy policies of these partners as well. If you receive a communication from a Sybase partner and wish to opt out of any subsequent partner communications, please contact that partner directly. 

** Intermediaries**   
We may also share your information with intermediaries such as credit card companies or banks. Intermediaries serve solely as links in the distribution chain, and do not store, retain, or use the information other than to process a transaction. 

** Legal Obligations**   
We may disclose your personal information to another party, such as law enforcement officials, in order to comply with legal requirements, court orders, government or law enforcement agency requests, to protect or defend Sybase, or where we perceive an immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to someone as a result of activity on our Web sites. Our disclosures may occur under circumstances where we may not be authorized to advise you of such action. 

4\. How does Sybase use the personally identifiable information that has been collected?

Sybase uses personally identifiable information in a limited number of ways. We use the information to complete transactions and to communicate back to you updates on services, products and promotions that we think, based upon your profile, that you would find of particular interest. 

We may, from time to time, send you communications regarding our products and services. You may at any time opt-out from receiving electronic communications as explained below. We do not sell user information to anyone. 

**** 5\. Which 'opt out' options do you have as a www.sybase.com user?

From the MySybase portion of the site, we provide Web site visitors with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving electronic notifications from www.sybase.com at the point where we request information about you.
