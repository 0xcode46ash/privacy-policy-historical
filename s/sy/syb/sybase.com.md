# Public Relation - Contact List

This statement discloses the privacy practices for [www.sybase.com](https://web.archive.org/) and other Internet sites owned and operated by Sybase, Inc. Sybase wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy and this policy statement informs you about what personal information is gathered and tracked from this Web Site and how that information is used. 

## Information Gathered at our Sites

Sybase collects personally-identifying information provided through optional, voluntary registration on several of our sites. These include: 

  1. trial, evaluation and beta download registration, 
  2. event registration, 
  3. support and education registration, 
  4. online purchases 
  5. contest registration 
  6. subscription registration for sites that require subscription 



For contests, the information gathered in the entry form is used to verify the entrant's identity, to send the entrant an email notification that their entry has been received, and to contact winners and/or prize recipients. Because the rules and terms of each contest can vary, all information about each contest is clearly posted during the event. 

We also track the IP address of the clients from which people visit us and analyze this data for trends and statistics, but the individual users remain anonymous. 

If you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still visit most of Sybase, Inc. web sites, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, downloads and services. Personal information gathered at Sybase, Inc. web sites may be shared with third parties, such as Sybase partners, or for specific contest awards.
