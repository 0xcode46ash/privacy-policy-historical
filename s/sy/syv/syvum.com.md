# Syvum Privacy Policy

We at Syvum are committed to respecting your privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of personally identifiable information you share with us (any information by which you can be identified, such as name, address, and telephone number). That is why Syvum has established this privacy policy, so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your information. 

In general, you can visit syvum.com without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We track the Internet address of the domains from which people visit us and analyze this data for trends and statistics, but the individual user remains anonymous. 

To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following principles: 

### INFORMATION 

We want to give you information about our privacy policy and assure you that we take reasonable steps to see that it is followed within our company. 

### CHILDREN UNDER 13

Syvum does not collect any information from children under 13 that could identify them. Although guests under 13 years of age may be allowed to participate in some contests and promotions, if such a guest wins, notification and prizes will be sent only to the parents or guardians. Publication of contest winners names for individuals under 13 require parental or guardian consent. 

### CHOICE 

There are times when we may collect personal information from you. It is our intent to inform you before we do that and to tell you what we intend to do with the information. You will have the option not to provide the information, and in the future you will be able to "opt out" of certain uses of the information. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still visit most of the syvum.com Web site, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services. 

### ACCURACY 

We do our best to maintain the accuracy of personal information you supply to us; we are working on tools that will allow you to review and update your information in the future. 

### SECURITY 

We will take appropriate steps to protect the information you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. 

### COOKIES

Our shopping cart uses "cookies" to make your shopping experience enjoyable. The product codes in your cart are stored in the text in the cookies. If you do not wish to use cookies, you may still shop directly from our online shop. 

### SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

Syvum shares aggregate information about its users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. For example, we will say Syvum's audience is x percent females and y percent males. This data is used to customize the content and advertising to deliver a better experience for our users. 

### COMMITMENT 

We are committed to privacy. Personal data privacy is a new and evolving area, and Syvum is evolving to meet these demands. Mistakes are possible; miscommunication is possible. If you have any comments or questions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at [info@syvum.com](mailto:info@syvum.com). We will address any issue to the best of our abilities. 

By using this site, you signify your assent to the Syvum Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our site. Your continued use of the Syvum Web Site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. 

Thank you for your support of these policies and of Syvum Technologies.
