# Sydney Airport : privacy policy

Sydney Airport Corporation Limited respects the rights of all individuals in relation to the privacy of information of a personal nature collected, held and used by the corporation.

## Introduction

Sydney Airport Corporation Limited ("SACL") has created this Privacy Statement in order to demonstrate its firm commitment to privacy and to explain how personal information collected by us is protected.

SACL's policy concerning personal information is subject to the National Privacy Principles set out in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).

This Statement explains the kinds of information which SACL collects, how that information might be used or disclosed, and how it is protected.  In addition, it provides guidance as to your rights to privacy and our rights and obligations in relation to collected information.

The Privacy Act and this Statement apply to any personal information you provide to us, or information about you provided to us by someone else.  There are, however, certain exemptions, such as records relating to a person's employment with SACL.

For the purposes of this Statement it is any information about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained from, the information - for example, your name, address, date of birth, drivers licence number, employer's or company name and your telephone number.

The types of personal information which SACL collects will depend on the circumstances of its collection and the nature of your particular dealing with us.  Information we might collect about you in general dealings could include:

·         your name, address, telephone numbers, date of birth, employment details, and your drivers licence number.

In the case of security-related information, such as would be required when applying for an Aviation Security Identification Card (ASIC) or other access to the Security Restricted Area at Sydney Airport, we are required by law to collect additional personal information, including:

·         your place of birth, previous residential addresses for the last 20 years, and details of any criminal charges or convictions against you for the last 10 years.

**When does SACL disclose personal information to third parties?**

SACL will not sell, rent, trade or otherwise commercially supply to third parties any personal information obtained from you unless we have your consent.

Information collected from security pass applications, may be provided to government agencies from time to time, such as the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department (Australian Security Intelligence Organisation), the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Customs Service, the Australian Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, and the NSW Police Service, for security, customs and immigration purposes.

We may disclose your personal information to our contractors (for the purpose of the services which they provide) so that we can complete a transaction on your behalf or provide you with a service that you have requested. 

In such circumstances we prohibit our third party contractors from using personal information about you except for the specific purpose for which it has been supplied or where your consent has been obtained for some other use. Such consent may be express or implied by conduct.

SACL will also disclose information about you if we are required by law to do so.

**How does SACL control access to and protect your personal information?**

The security of your personal information is very important to us.  SACL has security measures designed to provide reasonable protection against misuse and loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. Such measures include:

·         network segregation for sensitive information stored electronically, with access restricted to staff holding appropriate positions;

·         firewalls and login password protocols for all information stored electronically;

·         secure, access-controlled premises;

·         limited access locations for information stored as hard copy;

·         confidentiality provisions in all our employment and service contracts;

·         registers are maintained of all visitors to any part of our premises where personal information may be stored, and such visitors are required to be accompanied by a member of our staff at all times.

SACL also employs secure methods for the destruction or de-identification of personal information, which is undertaken as soon as permitted by law and where such information is no longer required by us.  Personal Information arising from contractual arrangements, security pass applications or incidents is preserved for seven years.

**What rights do you have to access and correct your personal information held by us?**

You may request access to, and correction of, any of your personal information held by SACL, and such access will be provided and corrections made unless there is an applicable exception under the National Privacy Principles.

Where SACL incurs a cost associated with complying with your request, including photocopying, administration or archive-retrieval costs, a reasonable fee will be charged for compliance with your request.

All requests for access and/or correction will be processed within a reasonable time.  Also, if you deal with us using our website, you may be able to access and correct your personal information directly through the website.  If so, we will provide instructions telling you how to do so. 

**Is your personal information kept up-to-date?**

We take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is accurate, complete and up-to-date whenever we collect or use it.  If you become aware that such information is incorrect in any respect, please contact us.  We will take reasonable steps within a reasonable time to either make an appropriate correction or take alternative acceptable action.

**Changes to this Privacy Statement**

We may change this Privacy Statement as the law changes or according to the needs of our business.  Such changes will be updated on our Internet site at sydneyairport.com.au.
