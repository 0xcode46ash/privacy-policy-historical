# Privacy Policy

Sydney Airport Corporation Limited respects the rights of all individuals in relation to the privacy of information of a personal nature collected, held and used by the corporation.

**Introduction**

Sydney Airport Corporation Limited ("SACL") has created this Privacy Statement in order to demonstrate its firm commitment to privacy and to explain how personal information collected by us is protected.

SACL's policy concerning personal information is subject to the National Privacy Principles set out in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).

This Statement explains the kinds of information which SACL collects, how that information might be used or disclosed, and how it is protected.  In addition, it provides guidance as to your rights to privacy and our rights and obligations in relation to collected information.

Subject to the exemptions provided for under the Privacy Act and other legislation, the Act and this Statement apply to any personal information you provide to us, or information about you provided to us by someone else.

**What is 'personal information'?**

For the purposes of this Statement it is any information about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained from, the information - for example, your name, address, date of birth, drivers licence number, employer's or company name and your telephone number.

**What personal information do we collect?**

The types of personal information which SACL collects will depend on the circumstances of its collection and the nature of your particular dealing with us.  Information we might collect about you in general dealings could include:

your name, address, telephone numbers, date of birth, employment details, and your drivers licence number.

In the case of security-related information, such as would be required when applying for an Aviation Security Identification Card (ASIC) or other access to the Security Restricted Area at Sydney Airport, we are required by law to collect additional personal information, including:

your place of birth, previous residential addresses for the last 20 years, and details of any criminal charges or convictions against you for the last 10 years.

In the case of marketing related information we might collect additional information such as:

your preferences concerning types of products or services, the frequency of use of certain types of products or services, methods, purpose and frequency of travel, preferred destinations and income demographic.

In the case of information collected through the Sydney Airport website, "cookies" may be used.  A cookie is a very small text file which is stored on your computer's hard drive when you first visit our website.  When you come back to our website, it tells us that someone using the same browser on which the cookie is stored has returned.  It is only if you provide us with personal information when using our website that we know anything personal about you.  Cookies help us to improve our website and monitor Internet traffic.

**How do we collect information?**

Personal information will normally only be collected directly from you when you deal with us by telephone, by correspondence through a letter, fax or e-mail, via our Internet website or through direct face-to-face contact.

There may be occasions when we collect personal information about you from a third party, such as:

·         a service provider;

·         a customer airline or retail outlet;

·         in relation to security matters, a law-enforcement agency;

·         a publicly available source.

Except when it is not reasonable or practical to do so, we would normally seek your consent to obtain personal information from a third party.

**What if you refuse to supply information?**

Generally speaking, you are not obliged to provide us with personal information about you.  Failure to do so, however, may mean that we are unable to transact business with you, process any application for the issue of an authority, licence, pass or permit, or provide you with an appropriate level of service.

Also, if it is lawful and practicable, we will give you the option of not identifying yourself when dealing with us.

**How does SACL use your personal information?**

We will only use or disclose your personal information in accordance with the Privacy Act and the National Privacy Principles set out in that Act.

Personal Information collected by us is used in any of the following ways:

·         to help us develop, improve, manage and administer all of the services we provide to you;

·         to ensure that our business systems are functional and reliable, which may include fulfilling legal     
  obligations;

·         to effectively process applications for the issue of authorities, licenses, passes and permits;

·         to conduct marketing activities including market research;

·         as part of the investigation and analysis of incidents which occur within the precincts of Sydney   
  Airport;

·         to enforce a contract or agreement which SACL has with you.

Often you will be aware that your personal information is being used, as we will be in close consultation or correspondence with you.  We will use your personal information for purposes to which you have specifically consented.  Also, we might use your personal information where you would reasonably expect that we would use that information for a related purpose. 

For example, when we believe it to be of use or value to you, we may use your personal information to notify you of services, special offers, opportunities, products or benefits which are being offered by SACL or any of our strategic alliance partners, customer airlines, tenants or associated organisations.

If you do not wish to receive such information then you just need to inform us.  Contact details are provided at the end of this Statement.

**When does SACL disclose personal information to third parties?**

SACL will not sell, rent, trade or otherwise commercially supply to third parties any personal information obtained from you unless we have your consent.

Information collected from security pass applications, may be provided to government agencies from time to time, such as the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department (Australian Security Intelligence Organisation), the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Customs Service, the Australian Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, and the NSW Police Service, for security, customs and immigration purposes.

We may disclose your personal information to our contractors (for the purpose of the services which they provide) so that we can complete a transaction on your behalf or provide you with a service that you have requested. 

In such circumstances we prohibit our third party contractors from using personal information about you except for the specific purpose for which it has been supplied or where your consent has been obtained for some other use. Such consent may be express or implied by conduct.

SACL will also disclose information about you if we are required by law to do so.

**How does SACL control access to and protect your personal information?**

The security of your personal information is very important to us.  SACL has security measures designed to provide reasonable protection against misuse and loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. Such measures include:

·         network segregation for sensitive information stored electronically, with access restricted to staff holding appropriate positions;

·         firewalls and login password protocols for all information stored electronically;

·         secure, access-controlled premises;

·         limited access locations for information stored as hard copy;

·         confidentiality provisions in all our employment and service contracts;

·         registers are maintained of all visitors to any part of our premises where personal information may be stored, and such visitors are required to be accompanied by a member of our staff at all times.

SACL also employs secure methods for the destruction or de-identification of personal information, which is undertaken as soon as permitted by law and where such information is no longer required by us.  Personal Information arising from contractual arrangements, security pass applications or incidents is preserved for seven years.

**What rights do you have to access and correct your personal information held by us?**

You may request access to, and correction of, any of your personal information held by SACL, and such access will be provided and corrections made unless there is an applicable exception under the National Privacy Principles.

Where SACL incurs a cost associated with complying with your request, including photocopying, administration or archive-retrieval costs, a reasonable fee will be charged for compliance with your request.

All requests for access and/or correction will be processed within a reasonable time.  Also, if you deal with us using our website, you may be able to access and correct your personal information directly through the website.  If so, we will provide instructions telling you how to do so. 

**Is your personal information kept up-to-date?**

We take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is accurate, complete and up-to-date whenever we collect or use it.  If you become aware that such information is incorrect in any respect, please contact us.  We will take reasonable steps within a reasonable time to either make an appropriate correction or take alternative acceptable action.

**Changes to this Privacy Statement**

We may change this Privacy Statement as the law changes or according to the needs of our business.  Such changes will be updated on our Internet site at sydneyairport.com.au.
