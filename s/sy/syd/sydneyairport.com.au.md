# Privacy Policy

Sydney Airport Corporation Limited (“SACL”) is committed to protecting your personal information in accordance with the National Privacy Principles set out in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).

  
This Privacy Policy sets out how we handle personal information to comply with our obligations. 

**What personal information do we collect?**

 The types of personal information which SACL collects will depend on the circumstances of its collection and the nature of your particular dealing with us. 

Information we collect about you in general dealings could include:

 - your name, address, telephone numbers, date of birth, employment details, and your drivers licence number and details;  
- a recording of your image on Closed Circuit Television (cctv) footage; and/or  
- a recording of your voice from calls to certain airport operations or security telephone lines.

 In the case of matters relating to security or airfield operations – for example, applications for an Aviation Security Identification Card (ASIC), other forms of identification card or an Authority to Drive Airside (ADA) at Sydney Airport -- we may collect additional personal information in order to manage and administer our business systems and comply with our legislative obligations.  This information includes:

- your place of birth, country of citizenship and gender;   
- your photo; and / or  
- in the case of applications for an ASIC or other form of identification card, your previous residential addresses for the last 10 years, details of previous criminal offences, details of any pending prosecutions, and information provided to us by relevant government agencies (such as the outcome of criminal records checks, security assessments and immigration checks). 

 In the case of marketing-related matters, we might collect additional information such as:

 - your preferences concerning types of products or services;  
- the frequency of use of certain types of products or services  
- the methods, purpose and frequency of travel;   
- your preferred destinations; and   
- your income demographics.

  **How do we collect information?**

 Personal information will normally only be collected directly from you when you deal with us by telephone, by correspondence through a letter, fax or e-mail, via our Internet website, by making an application for an ASIC, ADA or other form of identification card, or through direct face-to-face contact.

Other ways in which we collect personal information include:

- through the use of ‘cookies’ on our website.  A cookie is a very small text file which is stored on your computer's hard drive when you first visit our website.  This information may be used to identify repeat visitors to our website and areas of interest on our website;

- recording your image on cctv footage taken on SACL premises.  SACL’s use of CCTV is part of an ongoing crime prevention initiative, targeting crime and other risks to aviation safety and airport security.  All footage captured by cctv is retained for a specific period, after which time it is erased; and

- through recording calls to certain airport operations and security telephone lines for security and/or safety purposes.

There may be occasions when we collect personal information about you from a third party, such as:

 - a service provider;  
- a customer airline or retail outlet;  
- in relation to security matters, a government department, body or law-enforcement agency;  
- a publicly available source.

 Where SACL collects personal information about you from a third person, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that you are aware that we have the information and that it will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

  **What if you refuse to supply information?**

 Generally speaking, you are not obliged to provide us with personal information about you.  However, failure to do so may mean that we are unable to transact business with you, process any application for the issue of an authority, licence, pass or permit, or provide you with an appropriate level of service.

  **How does SACL use your personal information?**

 Personal Information collected by SACL is generally used in any of the following ways:  
- to help us develop, improve, manage and administer all of the services we provide to you;  
- to ensure that our business systems are functional and reliable, which may include fulfilling legal obligations;  
- to process applications effectively for the issue of authorities, licenses, passes, permissions and permits (including ADAs, ASICs, and other identification cards);  
- to assess whether or not any authorities, licenses, passes, permissions and permits should be cancelled or suspended;  
- to conduct marketing activities including market research;  
- as part of the investigation and analysis of incidents or occurrences (including potential incidents and occurrences) which occur on or at Sydney Airport;  
- to investigate, respond to a defend claims made against, or involving, SACL;  
- to enforce a contract or agreement which SACL has with you.

 We may also use your personal information for related purposes such as   
to notify you of services, special offers, opportunities, products or benefits which are being offered by SACL or any of our strategic alliance partners, customer airlines, tenants or associated organisations.

 If you do not wish to receive such information then you just need to inform us.  Contact details are provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.

We will not use your personal information for purposes other than those set out above without your consent or unless that use is authorised under the Privacy Act 1988.

  **When does SACL disclose personal information to third parties?**

 SACL will only disclose your personal information to persons or bodies external to SACL where permitted by the Privacy Act 1988, including in the following circumstances:

- where you consent to the disclosure;  
- in the case of information collected through your application for an ASIC or any other identification card, this may be provided to government agencies from time to time (such as the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department (Australian Security Intelligence Organisation or AusCheck), the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Customs Service, the Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship, and the NSW Police) for security, law enforcement, customs and immigration purposes;  
- to our contractors (for the purpose of the services which they provide) so that we can complete a transaction on your behalf or provide you with a service that you have requested;  
- where required by law such as under a subpoena issued by a court; or  
- for law enforcement or safety purposes, or operational purposes for which the information was collected. 

   **How does SACL protect your personal information?**

 SACL has security measures designed to provide reasonable protection against misuse and loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. Such measures include:

 - network segregation for sensitive information stored electronically, with access restricted to staff holding appropriate positions;  
- firewalls and login password protocols for all information stored electronically;  
- secure, access-controlled premises;  
- limited access locations for information stored as hard copy;  
- confidentiality provisions in all our employment and service contracts;  
- registers are maintained of all visitors to any part of our premises where personal information may be stored, and such visitors are required to be accompanied by a member of our staff at all times.

 SACL also employs secure methods for the destruction or de-identification of personal information, which is undertaken when permitted by law and where such information is no longer required by us. 

  **What rights do you have to access and correct your personal information held by us?**

 You may request access to, and correction of, any of your personal information held by SACL, and such access will be provided and corrections made except where precluded by the Privacy Act 1988.

 All requests for access and/or correction will be processed within a reasonable time.  In some situations, you may be able to access and correct your personal information directly through our website. 

There is no application fee for making a request to access your personal information.  However, we may charge an administrative fee for the provision of information in order to recover costs.
