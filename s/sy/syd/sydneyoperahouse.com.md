# Sydney Opera House

Sydney Opera House respects your privacy.

At Sydney Opera House, all our customers are very important to us, and we are committed to protecting all your personal details securely and sensitively, in accordance with the NSW Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998.

Our Customer Privacy Statement outlines how we deal with any personal information, whether it is through the Box Office Call Centre, in person sales at Sydney Opera House, or on our website (www.sydneyoperahouse.com).

Sydney Opera House’s Customer Privacy Statement is divided into the following sections:

* How is personal information collected?

In order to provide customers with a quality service, Sydney Opera House offers customers the ability to purchase tickets through three different sales channels; 

  * A call centre provides telephone, fax, email and mail sales service for performances and guided tours.
  * In person sales are available through the Box Office at Sydney Opera House.
  * The website provides an online sales channel.



These sales channels reflect the various methods in which the Sydney Opera House collects personal information about customers. Collection of information will occur at the time you purchase ticket/s.

* What personal information does Sydney Opera House collect?

If you wish to browse Sydney Opera House’s website for performance information, you will remain anonymous during your entire visit. 

If you wish to purchase tickets from Sydney Opera House, we need you to provide information including name, mailing address, telephone and other personal identifying information. 

* How is your personal information used?

The personal information you supply us helps us provide you with a superior service and allows us to serve you better. It is also used by Sydney Opera House for marketing and research purposes. 

Sydney Opera House may use your personal information to: 

  * Process and manage your purchase;
  * Process your transaction under the terms of our credit card merchant agreements governing credit card transactions;
  * Contact you if we have difficulties with your transaction;
  * Contact you if events change; 
  * Send you your tickets via mail (if your order was made through a telephone, fax or mail booking);
  * Send you confirmation about your ticket booking, via email or fax;
  * Send out direct marketing material by post;
  * Send out Sydney Opera House newsletters by email, if you have elected to receive them;
  * Send out SMS messages if you elected to receive them; and
  * Compile an anonymous consumer profile about you to enable Sydney Opera House to better serve you. 


* When and how can you opt out?

If you wish only to receive information about your ticket purchase or as legally required, you may request that you do not receive other communications (that is: you may “opt out”). If you wish to opt out you can do so by contacting Sydney Opera House on (02) 9250 7111 or [enews@sydneyoperahouse.com](mailto:enews@sydneyoperahouse.com). Sydney Opera House will activate your request as soon as reasonably possible.

* Security of personal information

Sydney Opera House takes reasonable steps to protect all the personal information it receives. Data collected online is stored in a Microsoft SQL database which is protected and secure. 

Only select personnel in the Marketing, Box Office and IT areas have access to our customer’s personal information, and only under strict controls and procedures.

* Will personal information be given to anyone else?

Sydney Opera House will not trade, sell or rent personal information about our customers to or with third parties. However, as explained below, Sydney Opera House may disclose personal information about you in some circumstances. When you purchase a ticket(s) to an event, unless you tell us otherwise, Sydney Opera House may disclose your personal details (except email and SMS addresses) to promoters and performing companies of those events you attended, so that they can provide you with promotional material about upcoming events. 

We may also disclose information to third party contractors and service providers to assist us to operate our business or to provide a service to you (i.e. service providers that assist us to send out our mail/email to customers). 

If Sydney Opera House provides your personal information to promoters or performing companies, or engages contractors and service providers to handle personal information, we require these organisations to agree to comply with our Privacy Statement and with strict conditions governing how personal information is to be handled. Otherwise, Sydney Opera House will only disclose personal information if this is required by law or permitted under the Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998. 

* How can you check and update your personal details and preferences?

You have a right to access and correct your personal information and privacy preference at any time. If you would like to update or delete your personal details, please contact Sydney Opera House:

Email - [privacy@sydneyoperahouse.com](mailto:privacy@sydneyoperahouse.com)

(If you contact us via email, you will be sent one final email confirming your request has been processed).

A session cookie lets us know that you are the same person wherever you are on the site. Therefore if you select a particular performance and place it in the cart, when you go to the Box Office, we will be able to identify the performance you have chosen. Once you have closed down the browser, the cookie is destroyed and no personal information is maintained.

* Changes to this Privacy Statement

This Privacy Statement may change from time to time, particularly as new industry codes are introduced.
