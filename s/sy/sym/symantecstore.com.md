# Privacy Policy

  
Symantec Corporation ("Symantec") takes safeguarding online privacy seriously. Please read the following to understand Symantec's privacy practices. This policy applies to information gathered through Symantec's web sites. Users should be aware that Symantec's web site might link them to the web sites of third parties. This privacy policy only applies to activities within Symantec's web site and does not apply to activities on the web sites of third parties. 

Symantec reserves the right to change its privacy policy, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to publish those changes so that users will always be aware of what information Symantec gathers and how it uses that information. 

**What information does Symantec gather about its users?**

_Does Symantec ask for personal information?_

Symantec requests information regarding users' names, emails, credit card numbers, resident countries, job titles, company names, telephone numbers, software and hardware product purchases, along with other personal information, when users purchase products, enter contests or other promotions, or sign up for services. Information essential in order for Symantec to provide the services or products requested is generally designated as "Required" and information that allows Symantec flexibility in providing services or products, or which is used for internal statistical studies or market research, is indicated as "Optional". For example, a credit card number is required when ordering a product, whereas a fax number may not be essential, but would provide another means of communication. 

The choice of how much personal information is disclosed to Symantec is left to the users' discretion. It is never mandatory for users to answer any question, although it may limit the services and products Symantec offers. 

_Does Symantec use cookies?_

"Cookies" give users a unique, random ID by storing small text files onto a user's computer hard drive with the user's browser. Cookies enable a web site to track a user's activities on a web site. 

Symantec's web site currently uses cookies in two areas. Symantec uses cookies on its home page to save users time so they do not have to choose a country site each time they visit Symantec's web site. Symantec uses cookies on its trialware download page to speed up users' activities in not having to register more than once. Symantec may choose to use cookies in other areas on its web site in the future. 

Symantec's cookies do not contain personally identifying information. Users are free to change their web browsers to prevent the acceptance of cookies. General instructions on how to change cookie preferences are found at <http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/security/cookies/cookies.html>. 

_Does Symantec track IP addresses, platform types, domain names, and browser information?_

An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to, and identifies, a user's computer, Internet service provider, and geographic location, whenever a user surfs the web. Platform types are operating systems, such as Macintosh, DOS, or Microsoft ® Windows 3.1/95/98. Domain names are computer Internet addresses (e.g. if a user is logged on from yale.edu or symantec.com). Browsers are computer programs that provide access to sites on the web, such as Netscape Navigator or Microsoft ® Internet Explorer. 

Symantec's web servers automatically track IP addresses, platform types, domain names, and browser information for system administration. None of this data is personally identifiable. Symantec analyzes this data in the aggregate to determine how many visitors it has, and which web pages are of interest. Symantec uses this data to improve its web site, products, and services such that they remain appealing. 

**How does Symantec use personal information?**   
When users submit personal information to Symantec, they should understand that they are agreeing to allow Symantec, its subsidiaries, and its affiliates access to, storage of, and use of, the data in any of the countries where Symantec, its subsidiaries, and its affiliates, do business, whether inside or outside the United States. 

Symantec reserves the right to use personal information collected in any manner related to Symantec's business, including, but not limited to, generating statistical studies, conducting market research, improving its products and services, sending users surveys, and notifying users of product upgrades and updates, new products, changes on its web site, special offers, seminars and conventions, and other changes within Symantec. 

**What choices do you have about how this information is used?**

_Options for Direct Mail:_

We respect your privacy and realize that not everyone likes to receive special offers or information. If you would like to request that your name be removed from our mailing lists, you may send this request by email, telephone, fax, or send a letter by postal mail, including your current name, address, telephone number and/or information contained in your Symantec mailer. Symantec will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. However, you may continue to receive materials from Symantec as a result of unintentional human errors. If you continue to receive materials from Symantec, please notify Symantec again through the methods described above. 

_Options for Email:_

If you decide to unsubscribe or deactivate your name from Symantec's email bulletins, you may email, telephone, fax or send a letter by postal mail with the information listed above or follow the instructions contained in Symantec's email bulletins located at <http://www.symantec.com/help/subscribe.html>. Symantec will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. However, you may continue to receive materials from Symantec as a result of unintentional human errors. If you continue to receive materials from Symantec, please notify Symantec again through the methods described above. 

**Does Symantec share the information that it gathers with third parties?**   
Symantec shares data with third parties as a value-added service that assists users in finding products or services, which they may not normally come across in daily life. When Symantec shares information with third parties, it generally only shares names and postal addresses. In certain instances, Symantec may share users' email addresses and telephone numbers. Symantec carefully reviews the materials of third parties and only selects those which it believes would interest its users. However, Symantec does not assume responsibility for any actions of third parties. 

If users decide they do not want their information shared with third parties, they should contact Symantec in accordance to the contact information indicated above. Symantec will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor users' requests. However, users may continue to receive materials from third parties as a result of unintentional human errors. If users continue to receive materials from third parties, they should notify Symantec again through the methods described above. 

Symantec is not responsible for the removal of personal information from third party lists if a third party has such data because of previous authorizations. 

**Do third parties share information with Symantec?**   
From time to time, Symantec may receive data from third parties for purposes of allowing Symantec the opportunity to contact users who are unfamiliar with its products and services. 

**Does Symantec share the information that it gathers with government agencies or law enforcement?**   
Symantec reserves the right to monitor and disclose to government officials or law enforcement, without a user's consent, any communications and personally identifiable information, whenever prompted to do so, by legal authorities, even when users have requested that their information not be disclosed to third parties. 

**What is Symantec's commitment to data security?**   
To protect against unauthorized access to data when users order products and services, or otherwise communicate with Symantec, Symantec uses firewalls (defined as computerized barriers) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption, which scrambles data before it travels across the Internet. Symantec takes commercially reasonable steps to establish secure connections with users and to limit to authorized personnel, access to its databases which contain users' personal information. However, Symantec cannot guarantee that its security measures will prevent all unauthorized access to users' data. 

Users' sensitive data is not distributed outside of Symantec, except when requested by legal authorities as discussed above, or when users provide Symantec with express written consent by email, fax or postal mail. Symantec defines "sensitive data" as data that pertains to a user's financial or credit information, such as credit card numbers. 

**Are there online risks?**   
Users should be aware of risks when they communicate on public newsgroups and message boards. On these forums, personal information may be collected by others outside of Symantec and used to send unsolicited emails or postal mailings. Symantec has no control over these actions and makes no representations, warranties or commitments concerning its ability to keep the information posted on these forums private. 

**What are Symantec's complaint procedures?**   
If users believe Symantec has not adhered to its privacy statement, they may notify Symantec by email, telephone, fax or postal mail. Symantec will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly resolve any complaints.
