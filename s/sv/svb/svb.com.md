We may also collect information about you when you interact with us via social media such as Twitter® and from a variety of third party sources such as government agencies, consumer reporting agencies and other suppliers or public information, in order to verify and enhance any of the information received or collected, to effect, administer and enforce the products and services we provide you and maintain the accuracy of our records.

Additionally, we use tracking technologies such as cookies and web beacons to help us measure the effectiveness of our Sites, how visitors use them and to help keep your transactions secure as you bank online with us. Cookies are small text files downloaded and stored by your browser when you visit a web site. Accepting a cookie does not provide us access to your computer. The type of information we collect using cookies includes pages visited on our sites, and whether you are a new or a returning visitor.

You may disable the use of cookies on our websites, however, please note that some services and functionalities may not work properly. For more information on cookies and how to manage them, see the Electronic Privacy Information Center’s cookie page at [www.epic.org/privacy/internet/cookies/](http://www.epic.org/privacy/internet/cookies/ "Electronic Privacy Information Center’s cookie page").

**Third Party Ad Networks.** SVB may work with third party ad networks to provide targeted ads on our own Site or third party sites. For example, we use third party network advertisers such as The Trade Desk (opt out and information available [here](https://web.archive.org/cookie-policy/ "cookie information page")) to serve advertisements on our own Site, third-party websites or other media (e.g., social media platforms). This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your activities on our Site. 

For information about the third parties we work with for advertising and analytics purposes and the choices you may have, please see our cookie information page [here](https://web.archive.org/cookie-policy/ "cookie information page"). 

**Do-Not-Track.** Currently, our systems do not recognize browser "do-not-track" requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking (e.g., by disabling cookies); you also may opt-out of targeted advertising by following the instructions in the Third Party Ad Network section.

If you submit any personal information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with our products and services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Notice.

## How do we use your information?

We use your personal information in various ways including for the following purposes:

  * To provide you with or evaluate your eligibility for products and services that your request;
  * To perform ordinary business operations (e.g. opening and maintaining your account or processing your transactions against those accounts);
  * To develop, evaluate, and improve our products and services;
  * To perform data analytics;
  * To comply with legal obligations, including those intended to prevent money laundering;
  * To effect risk control;
  * To effect anti-fraud and information security measures;

  * To track activity on our Site;
  * To improve the operation of the web site and the running of our business; and
  * To market our other services to you.



We may also use data that we collect on an aggregate or anonymous basis (such that it does not identify any individual customers) for various business purposes, where permissible under applicable laws and regulations.

## With whom will your information be shared?

Your personal information is shared with our affiliated businesses for the purposes of providing our services to you. In some cases we may share your information to respond to court orders and legal investigations or report to credit bureaus.

In order to serve you, we may share your information with other companies, including vendors and contractors. Their use of information is limited to the purposes for which we can use your information, and subject to agreements that require them to keep your information confidential. Our vendors provide assurance that they take reasonable steps to safeguard the data they hold on our behalf, although data security cannot be guaranteed.

Your anonymous information, collected using cookies and web beacons, is shared with a third-party analytics company to provide us with information about how visitors use our sites. We use this information to help us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, what products our clients are interested in, and what kinds of offers they like to see.

We do not share your personal information with non-affiliated third parties so they can market to you without your consent. Additionally, we do not share your personal information with our affiliates for marketing purposes, except that SVB Private Bank and Wealth Advisory, Inc. will reciprocally share information about customers for purposes of cross-marketing. Should these marketing practices change, we will seek your consent before sharing your personal information and provide a means for you to opt out of certain information sharing, where applicable. We will also update our privacy policies and notify you of the change.

## You may request to see and make changes to your personal data

You can sign into your SVB online account to see and edit personally identifiable information we have stored, such as your name, email, address or phone number. You can also contact us using the methods listed at the end of this Notice to request to see additional personal information we may have collected that pertains to you.

## We keep personal data until you delete it

We remove personal information (such as your name, address, email address or phone number) and other information associated with your SVB online account promptly after you cancel your SVB online accounts. Financial transaction histories may be kept longer as warranted by law or regulation. We may retain other data indefinitely or otherwise, at all times in accordance with applicable law.

## We take steps to protect personal information

We take reasonable steps to secure your personal information against unauthorized access, modification or disclosure. These may include encryption of data from pages where payments are made or other sensitive data is transmitted. Keep in mind, however, that no security or encryption method can ensure complete protection from hackers or human error.
