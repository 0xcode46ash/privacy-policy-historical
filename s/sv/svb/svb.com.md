_Protecting your Personal Information_

We recommend that you take the following steps to guard against any unauthorized use of your account and personal information:

  * Never provide personal information (including a social security number or account information) over the telephone, unless you have initiated the call and know with whom you are speaking.
  * Safeguard ATM/debit cards.
  * Memorize PINs (personal identification numbers) and refrain from writing PINs, social security numbers, or debit card numbers where they can easily be found.
  * Store canceled checks, new checks, and account statements in a safe and secure place. 
  * Shred unused, preapproved credit offers.
  * Report lost or stolen checks and/or ATM/debit cards immediately.

_Identity Theft_  


  1. Contact the fraud departments of each of the three major credit bureaus and report that your identity has been stolen. Ask that a "fraud alert" be placed on your file and that no new credit be granted without your approval.  

    * Equifax 800.525.6285
    * Experian 888.397.3742
    * Trans Union 800.680.7289
  2. For any accounts that have been fraudulently accessed or opened, contact the security department of the appropriate creditors or financial institutions. Close these accounts. Put passwords ( _ **not**_ your mother's maiden name) on any new accounts you open.
  3. File a report with your local police or the police where the identity theft took place. Get copies of the report in case the bank, credit card company, or others need proof of the crime later on.
