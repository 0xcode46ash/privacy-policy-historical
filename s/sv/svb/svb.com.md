## Marketing

We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. We have established the following personal data control mechanisms:

**Promotional offers from us  **

We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think our clients may want or need, or what may be of interest to our clients. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for our clients (we call this marketing). 

You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or signed up to receiving a service from us and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.

**Third-party marketing**  

SVB does not work with third party ad networks to provide targeted ads on our own Site or third party sites. 

For individuals resident in the EEA: We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any company outside the SVB Financial Group for marketing purposes. 

**Do-Not-Track**

Currently, our systems do not recognize browser "do-not-track" requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking (e.g., by disabling cookies); you also may opt-out of targeted advertising by following the instructions in the Third Party Ad Network section.

**Submitting personal information on behalf of others**

If you submit any personal data relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with our products and services (for example, if you provide us with personal data on beneficial owners), you confirm that you have the authority to do so and will provide the person that you have provided personal data on behalf of, a copy of this Notice.

**Social Media Platforms**

We may interact with registered users of various social media platforms including, but not limited to, Facebook®, LinkedIn® and Twitter®. Any content you post to such social media platforms, such as pictures, information, opinions, or any personal information that you make available to users on these social platforms, is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of those respective platforms. We recommend that you review them to better understand your rights and obligations with regard to such content.

**Opting out**

You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting us at any time. 

Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of the banking or other financial services we provide to you or where we have another lawful basis for processing the data.

**Cookies**

We use tracking technologies such as cookies and web beacons to help us measure the effectiveness of our Sites, how visitors use them and to help keep your transactions secure as you bank online with us. Cookies are small text files downloaded and stored by your browser when you visit a web site. Accepting a cookie does not provide us access to your computer. The type of information we collect using cookies includes pages visited on our sites, and whether you are a new or a returning visitor.

For more information on cookies and how to manage them, individuals in the US should look at the Electronic Privacy Information Center’s cookie page at [www.epic.org/privacy/internet/cookies/](https://web.archive.org/episerver/cms/www.epic.org/privacy/internet/cookies/ "www.epic.org/privacy/internet/cookies/").

You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this Site may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please see [https://www.svb.com/cookie-policy/](https://web.archive.org/corporate/cookie-policy/ "https://www.svb.com/cookie-policy/"). 

**Change of purpose**

We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us. 

If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

**5\. Disclosures of your personal data**

We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above.

  * Internal Third Parties as set out in the Glossary. 
  * External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.
  * Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this Notice.



We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

To prevent and detect fraud, we may share information with other organisations and public bodies, including law enforcement agencies. We may also check and/or file details with fraud prevention agencies and databases. 

Your anonymous information (i.e. not personal data), collected using cookies and web beacons, is shared with a third-party analytics company to provide us with information about how visitors use our sites. We use this information to help us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, what products our clients are interested in, and what kinds of offers they like to see.

We do not share your personal information with non-affiliated third parties so they can market to you without your consent. Additionally, we do not share your personal information with our affiliates for marketing purposes, except that for US clients, SVB Private Bank and Wealth Advisory, Inc. may reciprocally share information about clients for purposes of cross-marketing. Should these marketing practices change, we will seek your consent before sharing your personal information and provide a means for you to opt out of certain information sharing, where applicable. We will also update our privacy policies and notify you of the change.

**6\. International transfers (for individuals in the EEA only)**

We share your personal data within the SVB Financial Group. This will involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA).

Many of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will also involve a transfer of data outside the EEA. 

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: 

  * For data shared within the SVB Financial Group, we have a global data transfer agreement in place imposing the same data protection safeguards that we deploy inside the EEA.
  * Most commonly, we use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. 
  * Less commonly, for some providers based in the US, we transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. 
  * Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA. 



**7\. Data Security**

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. These may include encryption of data from pages where payments are made or other sensitive data is transmitted. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. 

Keep in mind, however, that no security or encryption method can ensure complete protection from hackers or human error. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

**8\. Data Retention**

How long will you use my personal data for?

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, compliance, accounting, or reporting requirements. 

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

A summary of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data is available and can be requested from us by contacting us.

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see [Request erasure] below for further information.

In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you. 

**9\. Your legal rights (for individuals resident in the EEA only)**

Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please click on the links below to find out more about these rights: 

  * Request access to your personal data.
  * Request correction of your personal data.
  * Request erasure of your personal data.
  * Object to processing of your personal data.
  * Request restriction of processing your personal data.
  * Request transfer of your personal data.
  * Right to withdraw consent



If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us. 

_No fee usually required_

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

_What we may need from you_

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

_Time limit to respond_

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

_11\. INDIVIDUALS IN THE US - VIEWING AND CHANGING YOUR PERSONAL DATA_  

You can sign into your SVB online account to see personally identifiable information we have stored, such as your name, email, address or phone number and you can ask the administrator on your SVB online account to edit any information which is inaccurate or incorrect. If you have a right under Californian or other US State legislation to request access to the personal information we hold about you, you can contact us using the methods listed at the end of this Notice to request to see this.

_12\. INDIVIDUALS   RESIDENT IN THE EEA - YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS_ 

You have the right to:

Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. 

Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. 

Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. 

Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

## 13\. Glossary

_LAWFUL BASIS_

Legitimate Interest means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.

Performance of Contract means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.

Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to.
