## What information do we collect from you?

The personal information collected could include your name, address, phone number, email address, account balances, transaction histories, assets, and credit history. 

Information we collect may be stored or processed on computers located in any country where we do business.

Additionally, we use technologies such as cookies (small files stored by your browser) and web beacons (an object embedded in a web page that allows checking that a user has viewed the page) to help us measure the effectiveness of how visitors use our sites and to keep your transactions secure as you bank online with us. Accepting a cookie in no way provides us access to your computer. The type of information we collect using cookies includes pages visited on our sites, and whether you are a new or a returning visitor. 

You may disable the use of cookies on our websites; however, please note that some services and functionality may not work properly. For more information on cookies and how to manage them, see the Electronic Privacy Information Center's cookie page at [www.epic.org/privacy/internet/cookies/ ](http://www.epic.org/privacy/internet/cookies/). 

## What do we intend to do with your information? 

We use your personal information to provide you with our services and to perform everyday business operations such as processing your transactions, maintaining your account, and, with your consent, marketing our other services to you. 

## With whom will your information be shared?

Your personal information is shared with our affiliated businesses for the purposes of providing our services to you. In some cases, we may share your information to respond to court orders and legal investigations or report to credit bureaus. 

In order to serve you, we may share your personal and anonymous information with other companies, including vendors and contractors. Their use of information is limited to these purposes and is subject to agreements that require them to keep your information confidential. Our vendors provide assurance that they take reasonable steps to safeguard the data they hold on our behalf, although data security cannot be guaranteed.

Your anonymous information, collected using cookies and web beacons, are shared with a third-party analytics company to provide us with information about how visitors use our sites. We use this information to help us learn things such as which pages are most attractive to our visitors, what products are our clients interested in, and what kinds of offers they like to see.

Aside from the situations listed above, we do not share your personal information with non-affiliated third parties without your consent. Additionally, we do not share your personal information with our affiliates for marketing purposes. Should these marketing practices change, we will seek your consent before sharing your personal information and provide a means for you to opt out of receiving marketing information. We will also update our privacy policies and notify you of the change.

## We keep personal data until you delete it

We remove personal information (such as your name, address, email address, or phone number) and other information associated with your account promptly after you cancel your SVBFG online user accounts. Financial transaction histories may be kept longer as warranted by law. We may retain other data indefinitely.

## We take steps to protect personal information

We take reasonable steps to secure your personal information against unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure. These steps may include encryption of data from pages where payments are made or other sensitive data is transmitted. 

## Links to non-SVB Financial Group sites
