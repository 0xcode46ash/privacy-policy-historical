### The data is yours

This is not news to anybody but we like to be clear and make sure everyone knows what is going on. The information you provide to SMSGATEWAYHUB is yours and it is our policy not to use, share, sell or rent this information in any way.

Having said that, we may use the collected personal information and other information we collect about your use of the service to improve the quality of the service we provide for you.

We may also be required to transmit or share your personal information with our third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other technology and services required to operate and maintain the service. This may require that your personal information be transferred from its current location to the offices and servers of SMSGATEWAYHUB and the authorised third parties referred to here.

### What information do we collect?

For the sake of transparency, below is a list of the information we require from all our customers, which we use to help us deliver the personalised service we know you enjoy from us.

  1. Name and contact details (email address, postal address, telephone and fax numbers)
  2. Credit card details (credit card number, expiry date, CSV number, and the name on the card)



### …and how do we collect it?

  1. Via our website (www.smsgatewayhub.com)



Conversations with you over the phone ( **07316450666** )

  1. Email conversations with our team (support@smsgatewayhub.com)

Although SMSGATEWAYHUB owns the software, code, databases and all rights to the SMSGATEWAYHUB applications, you retain all rights to your data. (What’s ours is ours and what’s yours is yours)

### Security of your information

SMSGATEWAYHUB will take all reasonable steps to protect your information from misuse and loss from any unauthorised access, modifications and disclosure.  We have purposely built all of our applications and internal management systems with the aim of preventing any of your information from being disclosed by any unauthorised means.

As hard as we try to ensure 100% security, there are inherent risks associated with using the internet.  In order to access and change any of your private account information or for our team members to provide you with these details over the phone, you will be required to identify your account via the individual account name.

### Message content storage

SMSGATEWAYHUB stores the content of all the messages sent by our users.  We treat the content of your messages as privately and securely as all other information and it is not accessible by any other users or SMSGATEWAYHUB team members without prior consent of the account administrator.

### We’ll grant you access to your data

On request, SMSGATEWAYHUB will provide the administrator of your account with a full export of the organisation’s data in a common file format determined by SMSGATEWAYHUB. The organisation’s data may be permanently deleted by SMSGATEWAYHUB 90 days after you stop paying to use our services, or at the administrator’s request.

### We don’t store credit card details

When you register for our service, we ask for information such as your name, company name, e-mail  address and mobile number.  You are not required to enter your credit card information until you decide to purchase prepaid SMS. SMSGATEWAYHUB uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing. This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use your billing information other than for the sole purpose of credit card processing on SMSGATEWAYHUB behalf.

### We monitor our systems

SMSGATEWAYHUB will never ever access the details of any transaction entered and stored in our system or system usage history for a specific identifiable user, except when granted permission by the user to assist with resolution of a system issue or error. SMSGATEWAYHUB may access non-identifying and aggregated usage information about our customers, in order to better understand you are using our services. We do this so that we can improve our system design and, where appropriate, have the system prompt users with suggestions on ways to improve their own use of the system.

### Disclosure

In line with this privacy and security policy SMSGATEWAYHUB continues to treat all of your information as strictly confidential and private.  We may, however, need to disclose information under the following circumstances:

  1. You have consented disclosure
  2. It is essential in order for a third party to provide services to us (eg. credit card merchant)
  3. We are required by a law enforcement agency, government agency, court or external advisor
  4. SMSGATEWAYHUB is permitted by law or in the interest of public safety



### You can opt out of any email communications

SMSGATEWAYHUB sends out billing information, product information, service updates and regular customer newsletters to our registered users via email.  We will include clear and simple instructions describing how you can opt out and be removed from the mailing list where appropriate.  SMSGATEWAYHUB will ensure you are instantly removed from our mailing lists.

###  Please remember to check the privacy policy of any third party website links

The SMSGATEWAYHUB website may contain links to other websites for your own reference. We don’t take responsibility for the privacy or content of these websites. Please make sure you check their privacy policies before using other applications.

### Your consent

By continuing to use our service and by providing SMSGATEWAYHUB with information, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your information in the manner described above in this policy and security document and any subsequent amendments.

### Updates from time to time

SMSGATEWAYHUB reserves the right to make changes to this policy at any time. We will post our changes on the website and highlight the changes we have made so you are always aware of where you stand.
