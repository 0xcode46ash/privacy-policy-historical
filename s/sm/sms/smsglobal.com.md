## **SMSGlobal Privacy Policy**

Information Collection and Use   
SMSGlobal is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. SMSGlobal collects information from our users at several different points on our website. Registration  
In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. 

Account Activation  
We request information from the user on our account activation and credit purchase. Here a user must provide financial information (credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing and credit reference purposes for filling customers' orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to (contact) the user. 

Cookies  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. SMSGlobal's website will log people out of a secure session after 2 hours of inactivity by a user. 

Log Files   
We use IP addresses to analyse trends, administer the site, track user's movement(s), and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

Sharing   
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for services. This company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

We partner with other parties to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. 

These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. 

Links   
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, SMS Global, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site (www.smsglobal.com.au). 

Surveys & Contests  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and address) and demographic information (such as postcode, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 

Security   
This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with industry-standard strong encryption - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked door. 

Users of the SMSGlobal Messaging Service must realise that although SMSGlobal employs high levels of security, no data transmission over the internet can be 100% safe. 

Therefore, use of SMSGlobal's Messaging is at the client's own risk. 

Furthermore, users must be aware that sending messages with SMSGlobal will have a similar level of security and reliability as that of Mobile Phone Networks. 

SMSGlobal, its employees and contractors will not be held liable for any loss or damage whatsoever, incurred through the use of SMSGlobal SMS Messaging, including loss of information due to carrier failure, network failure or negligence on the part of SMSGlobal, its employees or contractors. 

Please refer to our Terms and Conditions and Disclaimer for more information.
