# Terms and Conditions, SMSCountry API

At SMSCountry we respect and take steps to protect the privacy of our Users. We strive to make our site a safe environment for all who visit and use SMSCountry services. We are committed to providing you the best possible online service and experience as well as the best products and services. The purpose of this policy statement is to fully share with you - 

* How we use the information collected 
* With whom we share this information

This policy addresses our practices with respect to our website, but does not address the practices of any website we link to (including the merchants and content providers we link to). This policy is incorporated into, and subject to the terms of, our User Agreement. 

We use the information which you provide us to keep track of the SMSCountry services that you have signed up to receive. We may also use personally identifiable information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyse site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customise our site's content and layout. We do this in an attempt to improve our site and better tailor it to meet our users' needs. We may also use personally identifiable information about you to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banners and promotions. We will use your email address to contact you regarding administrative notices or latest news from time to time. We will use information in the file we maintain about you, and any other information that we obtain from your current and past activities on the site, in order to resolve disputes, to troubleshoot problems and to enforce our Terms and Conditions. 

  
Protection of Database Information 

Any information that is sent to SMSCountry for text messaging and or storage purposes will remain the property of the account holder. SMSCountry will at no time collect or redistribute this information without obtaining your consent, except where legally required by law to do so. This has particular reference to any database, numbers and/or recipient details that you may deliver to us, or store on our databases. 

  
Disclosure of Your Information 

As a matter of policy, we neither rent nor sell personally identifiable information about our customers to any third party. We may however aggregate all personally identifiable information and may disclose such aggregated information to any or all advertisers, marketing and general or commercial promotional purposes. Even in these cases, disclosure of any information that could personally identify you is not permitted.

SMSCountry offers some features on our site where sometimes it is required to provide some of the information about you to a third party, which is offering such services. It must be understood clearly that we will provide information only to the extent that the said third party requires your information, which enables you to use their service, but prior to that we will make efforts to notify you of specific information being provided to such third parties. Before you use the services of any third party, we request you to check up and evaluate if the terms and the conditions of said third party service are acceptable to you.

It is vital that SMSCountry receives from you the permission and valid rights to transmit your information to a third party. In addition, please note we will comply completely and fully with any or all court orders, information requests or otherwise from government agencies and regulators and any other legal and regulatory processes that require us to disclose personally identifiable information of our customers.

Frequently Asked Questions

Will you send any advertising or otherwise text messages to my cell phone without receiving my consent?

No, we do not send any unwanted advertising text messages. However, we may develop and introduce a program whereby customers and we can send advertising text messages to cell phones. However, this service will be only to users who give us their acceptance of this opt-in service. You will have the option to accept or not to accept the service.

I am getting a lot of spam on my cell phone. Why?

One of the many value added services provided by SMSCountry, allows visitors and members to send text messages to friends, family, colleagues, using the SMSCountry Interface. The SMSCountry Interface conditions of use forbid spamming to cell phone users and several software filters are in place to block spammers. However, we cannot guarantee that spamming will not ever occur.

Limits on Our Abilities

Although your privacy is our top priority, due to the existing statutory, legal and technical environment, we are unable to ensure that personally identifiable information of customers will not be disclosed to third parties in ways that are not described in this policy. Additionally, we may (and here you give us authorization) to disclose any private information about you to private entities, law enforcement or other government officials, which we may believe to be necessary at our sole discretion or appropriate to address or to resolve inquiries or problems. This will not be done for commercial purposes or for gain from SMSCountry as such.
