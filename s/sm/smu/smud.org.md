**SECURITY STATEMENT**

The Sacramento Municipal Utility District has created this security statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to security.

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under its control. 

Please keep in mind, however, that no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure.

As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit using our Web site, and you transmit such information at your own risk. SMUD further does not assume responsbility for use or disclosure of your information that are the result of unauthorized or illegal access to our systems or those of our vendors or partners.

**SSL security is implemented at any stage of the information gather process that requires personal information. **

**Secure Socket Layer,** SSL is a security protocol used for securing communications on the web. This protocol was originally developed by Netscape Communications and has now become an industry standard. 

A  **protocol** is a set of rules or procedures.

SSL technology takes a message and runs it through a set of steps that "scramble" the message. This is done so that the message cannot be read while it is being transferred. 

This "scrambling" is called **Encryption**. When the message is received by the intended recipient, SSL unscrambles the message, checks that it came from the correct sender [ **"Server Authentication"** ] and then verifies that it has not been tampered with [ **"Message Integrity** "].

Your browser will give an indication that SSL security is being used by showing some sort of icon in the status bar area (e.g., a blue key or a closed lock icon) of your screen. See your browser's documentation for more information.

If you have any questions about this security statement or the practices of this site, you can contact:
