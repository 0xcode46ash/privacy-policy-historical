## SmartWebby.com Privacy Policy

Jandus Technologies is committed to preserving your privacy online when you use our website SmartWebby.com (this site - also referred to as SmartWebby). Details of our information practices are as follows.

###  The Information We Collect

When you visit SmartWebby.com we collect two types of information from you:  
1) specific information you voluntarily submit, and  
2) general information our site gathers automatically. 

  * Specific Information You Submit  
If you buy a SmartWebby.com product/service or email SmartWebby for any reason, the information in your email will only be used by us to contact you directly.   
**Information Use:** We will keep your information on file only for the purpose you signed up for or for providing pre and post sales service. We use a third party credit card processor so we do not store sensitive financial information. The credit card processor provides information to the site about whether the charge transaction was approved or not.

We will never willfully disclose any individually identifiable information to any third parties without a user's specific permission to do so. We do not sell users' names or email addresses to other companies. We will only provide individually identifiable information to third parties only where it is required by law. 

  * General Information We Gather Automatically   
As you browse our Web site, we collect standard tracking data.  
**Information Use:** This information is aggregated with tracking data from all site visitors and is used to evaluate site traffic and usage patterns. It is never associated with individually identifiable information that would reveal anything personal about a user. We use such aggregated information to help us evaluate our site and to improve our services to clients.

### Security
