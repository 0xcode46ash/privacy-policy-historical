# Smart Webby Privacy Policy

SmartWebby is committed to preserving your privacy online. When you visit our site, we collect two types of information from you:  
1) specific information you voluntarily submit and  
2) general information our site gathers automatically. 

  * Specific Information You Submit  
If you email SmartWebby for any reason, the information in your email will only be used by us to contact you directly. We will keep your information on file only for the purpose of providing pre and post sales service. We may also share some of your information with third parties that are directly involved in the web site development process, such as the Hosting company or free plug-in providers e.g. Atomz for your free internal site search or GoldStats for your free site statistics.  
We will never willfully disclose any individually identifiable information to any other third parties without a user's specific permission to do so. We do not sell users' names or email addresses to other companies. We will only provide individually identifiable information to third parties only where it is required by law. 
  * General Information We Gather   
As you browse our Web site, we collect standard tracking data, which we use to evaluate site traffic and usage patterns. This information is aggregated with tracking data from all site visitors. It is never associated with individually identifiable information that would reveal anything personal about a user. We use such aggregated information to help us evaluate our site and to improve our services to clients. 
  * Third Party Links   
This site contains external links to other web sites, such as (but not limited to) best promotion, design, and webmaster resource sites. SmartWebby has no control over the content of third party sites and is not responsible for any information or content contained on these sites, nor is SmartWebby responsible for the privacy policies of those sites and the information they may gather expressly or automatically.
