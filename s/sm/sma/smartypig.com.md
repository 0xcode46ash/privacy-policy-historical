  * Information we receive from you on applications or other forms.
  * Information about your transactions with us, our strategic partners or others.

We do, however, disclose non-public, personally identifiable information about you to our service providers without your consent to perform the services on SmartyPig.com.

We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your non-public personally identifiable information. We may provide aggregated data about the usage of our services to third parties for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate. We may segment our users by savings category (i.e. electronics, home improvement). However, no non-public personally identifiable information about you will be included in this aggregate data.

To the extent permitted by law, we may disclose personally identifiable information to government authorities or third parties pursuant to a legal request, subpoena, or other legal process. We may also use or disclose your information as permitted by law to perform charge verifications, report or collect debts owed, fight fraud, or protect the rights or property of SmartyPig, LLC, our customers, our website, or our users.

#### Service Providers

We use other third-party service providers such as our banking, identity verification and retail gift card providers to provide services on our site. When you register on SmartyPig for an account, setup savings goals and redeem your funds, we will share personally identifiable information as necessary for the third-party to provide that service. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose including their own marketing purposes.

#### Security 

The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as your social security number) during registration, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can email us at [support@smartypig.com](mailto:support@smartypig.com).

"The following e-mail was sent to you on behalf of John Doe at <johndoe@example.com>"

#### Choice/Opt-out

SmartyPig users may choose to opt-in to receiving marketing information from selected partners, such as our banking service provider, BBVA Compass. This can be done during the registration process. Registered users may also opt-in to receiving this information at anytime under the Messages Settings section.
