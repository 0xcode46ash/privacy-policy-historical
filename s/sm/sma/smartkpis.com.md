## Use of your Personal Information

We do not share personal information about you outside smartKPIs.com unless you give us permission to do so or when the law requires it. However, by providing personal information to smartKPIs.com, you agree that such information may be stored outside your country or held by third parties providing services to The KPI Institute but will not be used by such third parties for their own purposes.

However, you will always have the ability to opt-in or opt-out from these programs or features. Also, your email address can be used without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes as well (such as notifying you of major website changes or for customer service purposes).

We do not give information about you to government agencies, organisations or anyone else unless one of the following applies:

  * you have consented;
  * you'd expect us to or we have told you we will;
  * it is required or authorised by law;
  * it will prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to somebody's life or health; or
  * the disclosure is reasonably necessary for law enforcement or for the protection of public revenue.
