# SmartSimple - Privacy Policy

## Information collection and use

SmartSimple is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. SmartSimple collects information from our users at several different points on our website.

## Disclosure of information

We will not use your email address or other information which you may provide to us in the future in order to provide you with any unsolicited message or information unless it is part of the information you are requesting. We will not share or sell any such information to any third party for such purposes. We may provide aggregated statistics about our users, sales, traffic patterns and related information to reputable third parties. We may also conduct research on aggregated data collected, but this will not include any personally identifying information.

## Protection of personal information

No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive a transmission from you, we make every effort to maintain the security of the personal information provided to us, including protection against unauthorized access, loss, misuse or alteration of information.

## Surveys and contests

From time to time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and mailing address). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site, collecting aggregate data for market research, or displaying results for the interest of other visitors. Survey results are not linked to personally identifiable information.

## Links to other sites

This site contains links to other sites. SmartSimple is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website. Similarly, if you use a link to go from the SmartSimple site to purchase products or services, you are completing a purchase transaction according to the rules and regulations of the vendor company, not SmartSimple.

## Notification of changes

SmartSimple reserves the right to change the SmartSimple privacy policy at any time. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our home page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

## What else should I know about privacy?

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on-line (i.e., message boards, through email, chat rooms, etc.) that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information on-line that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords, account and / or personal information.

## Contacting the website

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this website, please contact [privacy@smartsimple.com](mailto:privacy@smartsimple.com "Contact privacy@smartsimple.com")
