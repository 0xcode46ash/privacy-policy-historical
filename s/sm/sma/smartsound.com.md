_This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for www.smartsound.com._

Information Collection and Use

SmartSound Software, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. SmartSound Software, Inc. collects information from our users at several different points on our website.

Demonstration CD Requests

In order for us to ship a demonstration CD of our software products, a user is required to give contact information (such as name, address and email address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. Incomplete or false information provided will result in us rejecting the request.

In the case of international demo requests, your information may be forwarded to a reseller in your area to assist you with demo questions and order fulfillment, as well as available documentation in your native language. Each reseller has their own privacy policy. A list of resellers in your area can be obtained by visiting [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20120624072619id_/http%3A//www.smartsound.com/order/resellers.html)

Order

We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.

Log Files

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

Sharing

We use a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. This company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

Links

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, SmartSound Software, Inc., are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

Email lists

If a user wishes to subscribe to our email list, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. We do not share this information with any other company, and have no plans to do so.

Security

This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can [send an email](https://web.archive.org/web/20120624072619id_/http%3A//www.smartsound.com/company/contact.html).

Software Updates

We send periodic email updates to our customers to let them know about new software releases, specials, updates, and other information. Members are able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone.

Correction/Updating Personal Information

If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us. This can be done by calling our sales department at 800-454-1900 or emailing our [Customer Service department](https://web.archive.org/web/20120624072619id_/http%3A//www.smartsound.com/company/contact.html).[](https://web.archive.org/web/20120624072619id_/http%3A//www.smartsound.com/company/contact.html)

Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
