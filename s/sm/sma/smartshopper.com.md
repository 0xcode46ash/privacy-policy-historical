**_SMARTSHOPPER PRIVACY POLICY_**

At SmartShopper, we're committed to your privacy. Our Privacy Policy is simple. We do not collect any personal information about you or your shopping habits (unless you choose to register with us). The information you enter when you search for a product or service is used to automatically compare and find the best deals on the web.  We do  not trade, rent or sell personally identifiable information ("PII") with third parties for marketing or any other purposes.

**(a) Anonymous Aggregate Information**

SmartShopper collects and stores aggregated information about the web pages its users view and the data they enter in search engine search fields while using the SmartShopper software (the "Service").  SmartShopper uses this information to determine which alternative offers to display on your browser window pane.  

For every web page you view while using the Service, the SmartShopper software transmits from your computer to the SmartShopper server and stores the following information: your Internet Protocol (IP) Address; the Full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the web page you are visiting; general information about your browser and your computer's operating system; your SmartShopper cookie number and the date and time the above information is logged.  We also collect and store the following SmartShopper usage statistics: what is clicked on the browser window pane; the amount of time the Service is used during each session; which keyword searches are performed and what alternative results are received during any given session.

If you are only visiting our site ([www.smartshopper.com](http://www.smartshopper.com/)), we collect the following information: the URL of the web page from which you came; your IP Address; the date and time of each page you view; the name of and information about any advertisement that brought you to our web site; and computer and connection information.  If the URL of the page from which you came contains any PII about you, we will not attempt to determine your identity by analyzing the URL in any way.

**(b) Personally Identifiable Information**

Some of our services may ask that you register.  Registration is optional and you may choose to use the SmartShopper program without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself.  If you choose to register, SmartShopper asks you for some PII (for example your name, email address, and a city or an airport near you) in order to create an account. 

Any PII which is collected, as described above, is stored separately from the information about the web pages you view and the data you enter in search engine search fields and the two types of information are not correlated or linked. 

Except as provided above, we do not gather PII from you without your specific permission when you visit the SmartShopper site and download the SmartShopper software or use the Service.

**WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?**

SmartShopper analyzes its logs of usage paths and stored search terms collected from users to build anonymous web usage profiles.  However, SmartShopper stores this information separately from PII, and SmartShopper does not correlate or link a user's anonymous usage profile to any PII about the user.  SmartShopper uses these anonymous web usage profiles and stored search terms to determine alternative offers to display.

SmartShopper does not:

(a)    Associate or store non-personally identifiable web usage data or search information with any PII; 

(b)   Analyze such web usage data or search information to determine the identity of any SmartShopper user; or
