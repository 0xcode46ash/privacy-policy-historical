# Privacy Statement: Your Information is Secure.

Your Information is Secure  
We respect and protect your privacy. SmartDraw.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We only have access to or collect information that you voluntarily give us. We will not share this information with anyone outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to ship your order. 

You Are In Control  
You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. 

If you no longer want to receive our newsletters or product updates, you can remove your e-mail address from our mailing list by clicking on the automatic "unsubscribe" link in any of our mailings, by entering your e-mail address on this [unsubscribe page](https://web.archive.org/support/remove.asp), or by simply e-mailing us at [support@smartdraw.com](mailto:support@smartdraw.com?Subject=SmartDraw%27s%20Privacy%20Policy).

A Customized Experience  
To help improve your browsing and shopping experience, we use "cookies" on our web site. 

A cookie is simply a piece of data (e.g. an arbitrary number) that our server sends to your browser. Your browser may then store the cookie on your computer and read it back to our server if you visit our site again. These cookies allow us to create a more personalized experience for you while visiting our web site. 

If you're concerned about cookies, you can have your browser notify you when it receives a cookie, giving you the choice to accept or decline it.

Your Credit Card is Protected  
If you choose to purchase our products, your credit card number will be encrypted (scrambled) with state-of-the-art technology so that no one else can read it. Your credit card transaction will be cleared in seconds through our secure server. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page. 

Thanks to encryption, we believe that online ordering is now safer than giving your card number to a telephone operator, or handing your card to a waiter in a restaurant. 

Links to Other Sites  
SmartDraw.com provides a number of links to relevant third-party sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of these sites. We encourage you to be pro-active and read the privacy statements of any other sites that collect personal information. 

Surveys & Contests  
From time-to-time we collect information via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary. You may choose whether or not to participate and thereby disclose any information about you.

Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such education level, and job function). Contact information will be used only to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used only for purposes of improving the use and customer satisfaction of this site.
