**Cookies, Third Party Tracking, and Other Web Technologies**

When you visit Smartfares.com, we may assign your computer a "cookie" (a small, unique identifier text file stored by your web browser on your computer's hard drive). For example, whenever you sign in as a Smartfares.com member, we record your member ID and the name on your member account in the cookie file on your computer. We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you checked the box entitled "Remember me next time." Cookies allow us to serve you better and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience at our site. 

The use of cookies is very common on the Internet and Smartfares.com's use of cookies is very similar to that of Expedia and Travelocity, as well as Yahoo! and CN.com. Cookies are unable to do such things as run programs on your computer or plant viruses. 

We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information. 

We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies and log files to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate. These tracking technologies are employed to measure traffic on the site in order to effectively manage and upgrade the site. ****

Note that member IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes. No personal information about you is gathered or stored in the cookies placed by the Smartfares.com web site. You can always choose not to receive a cookie file by enabling your Web browser to refuse cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie. Please note that if you refuse to accept from Smartfares.com, you may not be able to access many of the travel tools offered by Smartfares.com.

 **How We Protect Your Information?**

Smartfares.com is committed to safeguarding your personal and confidential information. For that reason, we employ a staff of security technology professionals and utilize a full range of the best security technology available. Specifically, your information is secured from unauthorized access from the Internet through market leading firewall technology. We also protect the connection between your computer and our server from eavesdropping through industry-standard encryption technology known as Secure Socket Layer (SSL). Depending on your browser, this SSL will have encryption keys of up to 128 bits. To ensure that we fulfill our commitment to safeguard your information, we continually assess new technology for protecting your information to make sure that our information handling practices are in accordance with the highest industry standards and best practices on the Internet at all times.
