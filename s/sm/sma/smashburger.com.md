When you visit the Smashburger Website, we may also collect certain non-personal information by automated means, such as cookies. A “cookie” is a text file that websites send

different websites or online services. At this time the Smashburger Website does not respond to the preferences you may have set in your web browser regarding the collection of
your information, and the Smashburger Website may continue to collect information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy. We may enable third parties to collect
information in connection with the Smashburger Website. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, any collection of information by third parties on
