**Secure Ordering**|   
  
Orders placed at Smarthome.com are secure.

Typical communications across the Internet using web browsers are not normally encrypted. In theory this means that someone with the technical knowledge and hardware to capture data could potentially read communications that you send or receive. The Smarthome web servers are equipped with industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) [data encryption technology](http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/faq/5-1-2.html) that enables anyone using an SSL-compatible browser (such as Internet Explorer, America On-Line or Netscape Navigator or Communicator) to send and receive data from our server in encrypted form.

For the security of the information you share with SMARTHOME™ all our Internet hardware is maintained in secure computer rooms which are only accessible to authorized SMARTHOME™ employees.

When you click on "check out" our server will automatically transfer you into secure mode if it is supported by your browser. Most browsers give an indication that you have a secure connection by showing a closed lock in the status bar at the bottom of the browser window. In all cases, the displayed URL will show https instead of http.

If you get an error when you try to enter secure mode, it may be that you have an incompatible browser, or you are behind a firewall that does not support encrypted transmissions. (You may need to contact your ISP or system administrator to resolve these problems.) Please feel free to place your order via our toll-free order line (open 24 hours) at 800-SMARTHOME (800-762-7846).
