# Security & Privacy | Smarthome Home Automation Superstore

For more than 20 years, Smarthome® has been committed to providing you with a high-quality shopping experience with respect for your security and privacy.

## Secure Ordering

  * Orders placed at Smarthome.com are secure. The Smarthome web servers are equipped with industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) data encryption technology that enables anyone using an SSL-compatible browser (such as Internet Explorer, Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox) to send and receive data from our server in encrypted form.
  * All Smarthome's Internet hardware is maintained in secure facility accessible only to authorized Smarthome employees and representatives.
  * When you click on "checkout," our server will automatically transfer you into secure mode if supported by your browser. Most browsers give an indication that you have a secure connection by showing a closed lock in the URL bar at the top-left of the browser window. In all cases, the displayed URL will show https instead of http.
  * If you get an error when you try to enter secure mode, it may be that you have an incompatible browser or you are behind a firewall that does not support encrypted transmissions. You may need to contact your ISP or system administrator to resolve these problems. Please feel free to place your order by phone at 800.762.7846 Mon - Fri 9:00am to 9:00pm and Sat 10:00am to 4:00pm ET.
