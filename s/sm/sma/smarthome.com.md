# Privacy & Information Use Policy

At SMARTHOME™, we are committed to providing you with a high quality shopping experience with respect for your security and privacy. In order to process your order efficiently, or to send you the correspondence you request, we will need to collect certain information from you. The information may include your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, or credit card number and expiration date.

SMARTHOME™ does not share any of the financial information on your account with outside parties except as required to transact your orders. When, in the future, we identify reputable third parties whose products or services we believe would benefit our customers, we may choose to share this information with those companies. Contact [Customer Service](mailto:custsvc@smarthome.com) if you do not want to receive offers from any third parties (please use the subject no-third-parties and include your name and address in the body of the email). SMARTHOME™ reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information we've collected in order to (1) conform to the requirements of the law or comply with governmental orders, court orders, or legal process served on SMARTHOME™, or (2) protect and defend the property or rights of SMARTHOME™ or the users of the SMARTHOME™ Website.

To further safeguard your privacy, we offer the use of a secure server using [software](https://web.archive.org/web/20051212153052id_/http%3A//www.smarthome.com/secureinfo.html) that encrypts all the information in the transaction once you place the order. Additionally, all of the customer data we collect from the transaction is protected on our servers which are protected against unauthorized access. 

  
The SMARTHOME™ website uses a technology called "cookies" which are small files stored by your browser to help identify you for our shopping basket and to store the contents of your shopping basket between visits. We do not currently share any of the information we collect from cookies with outside parties. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you wish, you can usually change your browser settings to prevent cookies. If you disable cookies on your browser, our shopping basket will not be able to log you in, so please either use our [manual order form ](https://web.archive.org/web/20051212153052id_/http%3A//www.smarthome.com/orderform.html)or phone your order in at 1-800-SMARTHOME (800-762-7846).

  
You may update or change information related to your SMARTHOME™ account by e-mailing us at [custsvc@smarthome.com](mailto:custsvc@smarthome.com) with any changes you need to make (e.g., changing your mailing address when you move).

  
Orders placed at Smarthome.com are secure. Typical communications across the Internet using web browsers are not normally encrypted. In theory this means that someone with the technical knowledge and hardware to capture data could potentially read communications that you send or receive. The Smarthome web servers are equipped with industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) [data encryption technology](http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/faq/5-1-2.html) that enables anyone using an SSL-compatible browser (such as Internet Explorer, America On-Line or Netscape Navigator or Communicator) to send and receive data from our server in encrypted form.

For the security of the information you share with SMARTHOME™ all our Internet hardware is maintained in secure computer rooms which are only accessible to authorized SMARTHOME™ employees.

When you click on "check out" our server will automatically transfer you into secure mode if it is supported by your browser. Most browsers give an indication that you have a secure connection by showing a closed lock in the status bar at the bottom of the browser window. In all cases, the displayed URL will show https instead of http.

If you get an error when you try to enter secure mode, it may be that you have an incompatible browser, or you are behind a firewall that does not support encrypted transmissions. You may need to contact your ISP or system administrator to resolve these problems. Please feel free to place your order via our toll-free order line (open 24 hours) at 800-SMARTHOME (800-762-7846).

If you have additional questions about our Privacy/Information Use Policy, please contact us at [custsvc@smarthome.com](mailto:custsvc@smarthome.com). Please note: This SMARTHOME™ Privacy & Information Use Policy does not cover information that is inherent to the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond the control of SMARTHOME™, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. This policy is subject to change at any time.
