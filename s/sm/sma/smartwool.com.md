We use the latest encryption technology (Secure Sockets Layer or SSL) to secure your personal information.

This coding makes it extremely difficult for anyone to reach your personal information as it moves through our ordering system.

 To check if you are in a secure section of any website, look at the URL line of your browser; when you access a secure server, the initial characters of the site address will be "https". When you are in an https environment, all of your information is encrypted before it's transmitted across the Internet, then decoded only after it arrives at our secure servers.
