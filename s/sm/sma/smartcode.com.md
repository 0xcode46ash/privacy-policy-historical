# Smart Code - Privacy Policy Information

The given privacy policy specifies how smartcode.com respects your right to privacy and protects any information that you provide while visiting this website. 

**What information do we collect?**

Some technical information is collected automatically on each page in order to give us an idea of how people are finding our website, what technologies they are using to access it and which pages interest them. Each time a visitor loads a page from a website is counted as one 'page load'. About once a month we also collect the current set of page load information to look for trends, for example changes in the screen resolution, operating system or browser that is most often used. We take this information into account when planning for usability and accessibility in website design. We also collect information on how visitors reach our website, including search engine use, search keyword use, and links referring visitors to our website. We use this information in our search engine optimization and marketing strategies. Some examples of the information we collect and analyze include: the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your browser type and version, your operating system and screen resolution. We do not collect personally identifiable information about our visitors without their consent. 

**The information we collect is used to:**

\- Understand consumersâ€™ needs and provide with a better service  
\- Notify consumers about updates to our Web site  
\- Promote our software resources  
\- Customize the website according to visitorâ€™s interests

The information collected is not shared with any other organization, nor is any information sold or bartered unless otherwise stated. 

From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will contact you before we use your data for these new purposes to notify you of the policy change and to provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. 

Customers may prevent their information from being used for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected by using the [contact form](http://www.smartcode.com/main/contact.html).

Depending on the advertiser, cookies will expire (i.e. be automatically deleted) after different lengths of time.  
We use Google Adsense to support our site. Ads provided by Google AdSense are targeted to be relevant to the content of the website and / or page they are on (i.e. they get the information from the website contents not the visitors themselves). Google Adsense uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Googleâ€™s use of DART cookies enables it to serve ads to the users based on their visit to the current site and to other sites on the Internet. A user may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).
