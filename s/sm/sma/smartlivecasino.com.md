# Security Privacy - UK’s latest and most reliable live Casino – SmartLiveCasino.com

When you open an account at Smart Live Casino, your personal details are fully encrypted using 128-bit SSL (Secure Socket Layer) Digital Encryption which protects all related transactions over the Internet. This technology is a security standard and is used by all major Financial and Online Gaming Institutions worldwide.

To ensure the integrity of Smart Live Casino's client accounts, our e-wallet is managed by Metacharge Payment Processing Solutions. Metacharge processes real time payment transactions made by consumers for goods and services (both tangible and intangible) over the Internet, by telephone and mail-order.

Built around an advanced payment gateway, the Metacharge service also includes an Internet merchant account (akin to a bank account for credit/debit cards, which is required before a merchant can trade) and a suite of value added services including fraud prevention, ID verification and subscription management.

For added security, Smart Live Casino employees do not have access to your full credit or debit card details. You can use your credit card with total confidence. All debit and credit card details are stored on a secure server protected by the latest and most secure firewall systems.

1) Personal Information  
Here's what your personal information is used for: getting your account set up and looked after, building an accurate customer profile, making information from Smart Live Casino's marketing partners available for promoting the site, on the internet and other marketing materials. We may also promote wins of £10 or more but we'll just mention the amount and the abbreviated name, town, state or province and country of the winner. Your full name won't be used.

Smart TV Broadcasting will own your personal details but please note that the Gambling Commission of the United Kingdom will also have access to your account information. However, this information will only be used within the rules and guidelines that govern this site.

2) Information Sharing  
To ensure that we protect ourselves from the risk of fraud, money laundering and underage gambling we will utilize one or more 3rd Party Sources to verify your identity and/or age.  
The third party is called URU, and is owned by the GB Group. A link to URU can be found at the bottom of our website. This is an industry standard process adopted to validate your account silently.

Personal details collected about you when you visit this site may also be shared with the following: reputable marketing partners selected by us, any company that Smart TV Broadcasting may sell all or part of its business to, any competent legal, regulatory or law enforcement authority including the Gambling Commission. In this case, you will not be told of this disclosure or the reasons why and you will waive any and all rights that you may have in connection with such disclosure.

All sensitive player details are protected in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. In addition to this, we consult the EU privacy laws and the OECD guidelines regularly to ensure the protection of players' privacy and data flow.

3) Marketing  
Upon registration you will be asked for a response to the following statement:  
" I would like to receive Smart Live Casino Promotions and Newsletters via post/email/sms."

If you don't want promotional information or details of further offers, please ensure sure you un-tick this box.

You will also be asked:

“I would like to take part in Live Studio Competitions”

Again, if you do not wish to be contacted in relation to any competitions which will occur live on air, please ensure that this box remains un-ticked. 

4) Updating your details  
Have you moved? Changed your phone number? Changed your email address? Just give us a call on 0800 279 8510 and we will make the relevant changes on your behalf.
