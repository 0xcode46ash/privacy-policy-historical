**Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience with the Small Cap Network as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to visit our website with complete confidence.**

We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how the Small Cap Network collects information from all end users of our services (the "Services") -- those who access our website and/or receive our newsletter.

**Personal Information Small Cap Network Collects and How It Is Used**

**Introduction**
    

Small Cap Network collects information in different ways from Visitors and Subscribers who access the various parts of our Services. We use this information primarily to provide a customized experience as you use our Services, and generally do not share this information with third parties other than companies mentioned within our site/newsletters for investor relations purposes. However, we may also disclose personal information collected if we have received your permission beforehand or in very special circumstances, such as when we believe that law requires such disclosure or other special cases described below.

**Registration**
    

Members are asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for our Services including name, address, telephone number and email address. The personal information collected from Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member's account. This information is generally not shared with third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances.

However, in instances where Small Cap Network and a partner jointly promote Services, Small Cap Network may provide the partner certain personal information, such as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion for the sole purpose of allowing us and the partner to assess the results of the promotion. In this instance, once the partner receives the information, it will handle the information under its own privacy policies.

Small Cap Network may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information Members provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Members). As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services.

**Online Advertisements**
    

We share aggregated and non-identifying information about our Visitors and Members collected through the registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions with these advertisers. Additionally, in some instances, we use this aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements. For instance, an advertiser might tell us the audience they want to reach (for example, males between 25 and 55 years of age) and provide us with an advertisement tailored to that audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information we have collected, we may then display the advertisement to the intended audience. However, Small Cap Network generally does not share personal information about its Visitors or Members with these advertisers unless special circumstances require us to do so.

**Responses to Email Inquiries**
    

When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to Small Cap Network, we use the return email address to answer the email inquiry we receive. Small Cap Network does not use the return email address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with any third party.

**Email Marketing From Third Party Sponsors**
    

In addition, from time to time, Small Cap Network sends, on behalf of third parties, promotions via mail to some or all of its subscribers. However, in no event does Small Cap Network sell or otherwise transfer to third parties the email addresses of its subscribers. Small Cap Network strictly maintains the confidentiality of its subscribers' email addresses. In addition, users are always given the opportunity of opting-out of these promotions.

**Voluntary Customer Surveys**
    

We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if a third party conducts the survey. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary.

We take the information we receive from individuals responding to our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses from other Small Cap Network subscribers to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated; non-personally-identifying information may be shared with third parties.

**Special Cases**
    

It is Small Cap Network's policy not to use or share personal information about Visitors or Members in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. However, Small Cap Network may disclose personal information about Visitors or Members, or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or other user policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect Small Cap Network and our Members.

**"Cookies" and How Small Cap Network Uses Them**
    

A "cookie" is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain Web sites. Small Cap Network may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the products and services we provide and to manage our telecommunications networks. If you are a Member, we will use a cookie to save your settings and to provide customizable and personalized services. These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your customer information.

Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We do not control the use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them.

**Small Cap Network Commitment to Data Security**
    

Services and Web sites we sponsor have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information.

**Revisions to This Policy**

Did you see it? Did you see where our bulletin board stock pick SpongeTech Delivery Systems (SPNG) touched new multi-month highs today? OK, you probably didn’t. Visually, it’s almost imperceptible on a chart. The stock hadn’t traded above 4.9 cents in months, though it had reached that high a handful of times in recent weeks. Today [...]

There are two things that immediately come to mind about our Tenet Healthcare (THC) stock pick (so far). The first is, it’s been profitable. The second thing is, it’s been one wild ride. The ups and downs have been wide enough to make a sailor seasick. Good news though….I think one more good runup like [...]

An e-mail we received today reminded me to remind all of you that we invite any and all inquiries. Our focus is small cap stocks, but if there’s a burning question all of our readers can learn from, send ‘em on. You can send us an e-mail, but if it’s just as easy, you’re always [...]

In my morning comments I mentioned a blaring disparity among the indices. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both looked like they were fighting an uphill battle, while the NASDAQ and the Russell 2000 seemed to be holding up relatively well. After seeing today's action - which was pretty...

In a blog entry yesterday I was explaining why I felt SpongeTech Delivery Systems (OTCBB: SPNG) was on the verge of a breakout. The resistance at the 4.9 cent level has been under attack for some time now, and the attack has been getting stronger (on higher volume). In fact, SPNG hit 5 cents yesterday...

Last week when I was singing the praises of Voyant's RocketStream, I had a feeling it was something big. A technology that actually makes the internet work up to 200 times faster? No wonder Nielson Mobile wanted it! With somebody else is embedding the very same technology into their own software (less...
