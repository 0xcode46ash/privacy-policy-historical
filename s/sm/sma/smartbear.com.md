We occasionally use other companies to perform services necessary to our operations. In the course of providing these services, those companies may have access to your personal information.

We may also disclose, on an anonymous basis, statements made by our customers. 

In the case of online ordering, your information is used to process your order, create general product license codes, and to deliver products or product license codes. For free license code registration, your information is used as part of our technical support and quality assurance programs. In addition, we may use the information to contact you regarding a technical support issue or to follow up on a trial.
