# Privacy Policy | SmartSurvey

**INFORMATION COLLECTION**

We will not in any circumstance use the information collected from our memberâ€™s surveys in any way. In addition, any other material you provide SmartSurvey (Smartline International Ltd. ((Including images, email addresses, etc.)) will be held in the strictest confidence.

SmartSurvey also will not collect personally identifiable information about you except when you specifically provide this information on a voluntary basis. We will make every effort to ensure that whatever information you provide will be maintained in a secure environment. 

However, even if you opt out of receiving any communications from SmartSurvey, we reserve the right to contact you regarding your account status or any other matter that might affect our service to you and/or our records on you.   


**INFORMATION USE**

SmartSurvey reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user behaviour and characteristics. We do this in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the website. This will also help us improve our service to our members.

SmartSurvey collects IP addresses for system administration and record keeping. Your IP address is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. Our servers record incoming IP addresses. The IP addresses are analysed only in aggregate; no connection is made between you and your computer's IP address. By tracking IP addresses, we can determine which sites refer the most people to SmartSurvey. (Think of an IP address as it were your post code; it tells us in general terms where you're from.)

**COOKIES**

"Cookies" are small text files a website can use to recognise repeat users. SmartSurvey uses cookies to recognise visitors and more quickly provide personalised content or grant you unimpeded access to the website. With cookies enabled, you will not need to fill in password or contact information. 

Information gathered through cookies also helps us measure use of our website. Cookie data allows us to track usage behaviour and compile data that we can use to improve the site. This data will be used in aggregate form; no specific users will be tracked. 

Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside of the Web site that he or she is visiting. You can easily turn off cookies. Most browsers have a feature that allows the user to refuse cookies or issues a warning when cookies are being sent. However, our site will not function properly without cookies. Enabling cookies ensures a smooth, efficient visit to our website. 

**OPTING OUT**

Upon request, SmartSurvey will allow any member to opt out of our monthly newsletter. Also, upon your request, SmartSurvey will delete you and your personal information from our database; however, it may be impossible to delete all of your information without some residual data because of backups and records of deletions. 

Should you wish to opt out of any mailing from SmartSurvey then please contact support. 

The foregoing policies are effective as of 15th November 2005. SmartSurvey reserves the right to change this policy at any time by notifying members of the existence of a new privacy statement. This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.
