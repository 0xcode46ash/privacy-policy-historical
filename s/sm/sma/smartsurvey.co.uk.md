Use of client survey data – respondents: all information that you provide in response to a client survey will be provided to our client.

We may use information collected about the use of our software to provide you with the benefits of any updated features or to ensure that you are using the software in accordance with the terms on which it is licensed.

Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website. This helps us to improve our website’s performance and your experience of using our website. For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them [click here](http://ss.kbwizard.com/answer/about-the-cookies-we-use/ "About the cookies we use").

We use Web Bugs to help us better manage content on our website by informing us what content is effective. Web Bugs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Web Bugs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the full stop at the end of this sentence. Web Bugs collect information such as cookie identifiers, IP addresses, times and dates of pages being viewed and the URL of the page on which the Web Bugs appears. The data that we collect is aggregated and anonymised and we do not tie the information gathered by Web Bugs on our website to any personally identifiable information.

When we send you emails, we may include a Web Bugs to allow us to determine the number of people who open our emails and information such as when and how many times the email was viewed, whether any links were clicked on and whether the email was forwarded. When you click on a link in an email, we may record this individual response to customise our offerings to you. Web Bugs can be refused when delivered via email. If you do not wish to receive Web Bugs via email, you will need to disable HTML images or refuse HTML emails via your email software, but please note that this is likely to reduce the functionality of such emails.

We employ a web-tracking system to track visitor traffic patterns throughout the website. We collect the visitor’s domain name, referral data, browser, platform type and duration of the visit. The information gathered is used to produce overall usage statistics about our website, which we use to evaluate the website. We do not correlate this information with data about individuals. Please note that we do not currently process or comply with any web browser’s ‘do not track’ signal or other similar mechanism that indicates a request to disable online tracking of individual users who visit our website.

Our website may contain links to and from third party websites, including those of advertisers and our affiliates. If you click on a link to those websites you will leave our website go to the website that you selected. Please note that we cannot accept responsibility or liability for any use of your personally identifiable information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as us. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third party before you submit any personal data to them.

Our website includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, and the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our website. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it and we cannot accept any liability or responsibility for the use of your information by them.

The information that we collect from you is stored in the UK and will not leave Europe at any point. The security of your personal information is important to us and we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

All information that you provide to us is stored on secure servers. When you enter personal information within the customer login area of the site, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Where you use a password to access certain areas of our website you are responsible for keeping this password confidential and must not share it with anyone.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information and data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security, and any transmission of data to our website is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

Any changes we may make to this policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where the changes are material, notified to you by email or by means of a notice on our home page, prior to the changes becoming effective. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our privacy policy. You will be deemed to have expressly consented to any change if you continue to use our website and services after the date on which the change becomes effective.
