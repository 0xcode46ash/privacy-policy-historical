SmartSource is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of Privacy Principles applicable to all its U.S.-based companies. SmartSource has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information ("PII") we obtain from and about individuals located in the U.S. 

From time to time SmartSource may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, technology or industry initiatives. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices.

**_COLLECTION: COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ("PII") BY SMARTSOURCE_**  
_General_. SmartSource collects personally identifiable information ("PII" -- that is, information such as your full name, email address, mailing address, demographic data and preferential data) in order to respond to your requests for offers and information about products and services you are interested in. When we collect PII from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting the information to us so that we can respond to your requests. On those occasions when we obtain PII from a third party, we use only reputable sources of such information.

PII you submit in connection with the SmartSource Internet Coupons service is currently collected on our behalf by our business partners, planet U and Coupons, Inc., who share this information with us. . For information on how PII information is gathered and used for our "Printable" offers, please refer to the Coupons, Inc. Privacy Policy http://www.coupons.com/privacy.asp. Both of these links can be accessed on the "Get Coupons" registration page or the Frequently Asked Questions page. For information on how PII information is gathered and used for "Mail To Home" offers, please refer to the planet U "U-pons Privacy Policy," http://www.planetu.com/apages/privacy.html 

SmartSource does not knowingly collect PII from children under the age of 13.

Cookies remember information about your activities on our site and enable Smartsource to make your visits to our site more enjoyable. For example, cookies can store your password for easy logon to a site you have previously visited, can save your preferences for a personalized home page or can track the items you have placed in your "shopping cart" during a visit to our online store. The cookie itself does not contain PII.

In the course of serving ads to this site, our third-party ad servers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser, and may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to the SmartSource web site and other sites to provide ads to you on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

**_NOTICE:_** _SMARTSOURCE WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES._

When SmartSource collects PII from you, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information and the types of usage.

This Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send you information about their products and services and therefore want to share your PII (See "Use" below). However, at the time your PII is collected, SmartSource will notify you of your options regarding our use of your personally identifiable information, including whether we can share it with outside companies (See "Choice" below). Sometimes we collect personally identifiable information from consumers in manual format, such as a post card or subscription form. Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information from us. 

The SmartSource web site may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with a SmartSource logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by SmartSource (for example, sites operated by newspapers or retailers that have a business relationship with SmartSource). The SmartSource web site may also carry advertisements from other companies as well as advertisements placed by national Internet ad agencies. Although we choose our business partners and advertisers carefully, SmartSource is not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our site, of third party or so-called national advertisers, or third party ad servers. Once you've left the SmartSource site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you.

The SmartSource web site may also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with SmartSource. Visitors to those affiliated sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Policy.

_**CHOICE:** SMARTSOURCE WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII_  


SmartSource will provide you with the opportunity to choose whether your PII may be used for purposes in addition to those for which it was originally submitted. You will also be able to choose whether your information is shared with companies that are not affiliated with SmartSource (i.e., not part of the News America Group).

_**USE:** SMARTSOURCE'S USE OF PII_

SmartSource will use your PII in a manner that is consistent with this Policy and only to provide you with specific offers that you may be interested in, unless other uses are disclosed to you and you allow us to use your information in these other ways.

SmartSource may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us, that is part of the News America Group of companies. SmartSource may also share your PII with companies that are not affiliated with SmartSource, but would like to send you information about their products and services. For example, if you enter a sweepstakes promotion hosted by SmartSource.com, we may share the information you submit on the sweepstakes entry form with our sweepstakes partners and prize sponsors. SmartSource offers may be available on a variety of partner Web sites. In those instances where SmartSource offers are incorporated into a partner's Web site (i.e., "micro-sited") and where registration is required in order to receive those offers, your PII may be shared with that partner. Neither SmartSource nor any of its partners will provide your name or other uniquely identified information to a third party without your permission.

SmartSource employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your PII. Outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e., sweepstakes and contest administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses) may only use PII to provide SmartSource with a specific service and not for any other purpose.

If SmartSource obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of this information is governed by this Policy once the PII is in our possession.

SmartSource may be required to disclose PII to comply with legal requirements, such as a court order, and to protect the safety and security of visitors to our web sites.

_**SECURITY:** SMARTSOURCE PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII_

SmartSource uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. In addition, SmartSource uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete.

**_ACCESS:_** _HOW TO ACCESS, CORRECT OR DELETE YOUR PII_

Whenever possible, SmartSource will permit you to review the PII we have collected from you, to correct any PII that is incorrect and to instruct us to make your PII inactive in our files. If you want to do any of these things, click on the "Personal Profile" link on the Get Coupons page. On your Personal Profile Page, you can modify any of your PII elements and opt out of further communication from SmartSource.com. Additionally, you can send an email message to [webmaster@smartsource.com](mailto:webmaster@smartsource.com) with your name, mailing address, and email address to specify what actions you would like to be taken with respect to your PII. Please note that we will not be able to delete your historical usage information from our aggregate files.
