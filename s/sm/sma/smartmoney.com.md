SmartMoney.com Privacy Statement

Use of SmartMoney.com requires the submission of no personal data. However, in order to take advantage of certain personalized features, you will be required to submit a simple registration, including some information about yourself. Please read on for details about our privacy policy, what information we may collect and how we use it. 

Uses of Registration Information  


**·** Basic registration requires you to provide us a screen name and password of four-10 characters each, as well as some demographic information and a current email address. This information will then gain you access to the following features: email alerts; stock portfolio; watchlist; personalized calendar; advanced charting; forums participation; and a customized start page. You will also have access to any new tools we may offer in the future. The information you provide us helps us administer these features. Furthermore, your demographic information will be provided, in aggregated form, to our advertisers. We do not supply email addresses to our advertisers. Our users remain entirely anonymous. You are free to use as your screen name your real name or a set of characters you find easy to remember.

**·** For contests or promotions occasionally offered on the site, SmartMoney.com may ask participants for additional personal data necessary to run the contest or notify winners.

**·** Any information you may provide to third parties in the course of purchasing any products and services which may be featured on SmartMoney.com, is subject to the privacy policies of those organizations.

Privacy of Personal Data on SmartMoney.com  
No data you provide SmartMoney.com as part of your basic registration or personalization will be released to outside organizations. SmartMoney, however, reserves the right to disclose personal identifying information when required or permitted by law. The information is stored on secure servers. You may occasionally receive from us at your designated email address notifications of new SmartMoney.com features or offers. You may opt out of receiving those notifications at the time you set your personal preferences. Please remember to change your personal preferences for each email address that you may have registered with us.

Cookie Policy  
We use cookie technology to help members move faster through the site. A cookie is a small file sent to your computer by the SmartMoney.com site server. The most commonly employed cookies on SmartMoney.com are those that help us establish (1) whether you are a registered member of SmartMoney.com, and (2) whether a registered member has opted to use the "auto-login" feature, which eliminates the need for registered members to identify themselves each time they visit. A separate cookie from the company that handles our advertising production and tracking system helps identify which ad you may be clicking on, so that you will be linked to the right site. We may also use cookie technology to track the site's aggregate page views, which helps us determine which features the user base seems to be most or least interested in. An important point: We do not track your individual usage patterns using cookies, nor do we use them to track your financial holdings or other personal preferences in any individually identified way. Contrary to what you might have heard from other sources, cookies cannot get information from your hard drive against your will, cannot destroy files and cannot send you viruses.
