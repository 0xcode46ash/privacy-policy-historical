We at SmashingPicture take the privacy of our visitors very seriously.  We do use Google Analytics to collect aggregate information on unique visits, pageviews, demographics etc– but this information is used to analyze overall traffic patterns only.

Visitors who submit information via our Contact  will have their emails and IP addresses recorded, but that is necessary in order to reply to them and the latter is to prevent spam. To maximize privacy, we make a policy of scrubbing this form clean of data on a regular basis.

We will never sell or otherwise distribute your email address, IP address or any other identifying information to outside parties unless required by law.
