                             PRIVACY STATEMENT FOR SMARTMUSIC.COM
PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT CAREFULLY.
MakeMusic, Inc. (the “Company”) has a strong commitment to protecting personal privacy. We will
respect certain privacy principles regarding the personal information that you provide. The purpose of
this Privacy Statement is to tell you what information we gather on this website, how we use the
information, and how we protect your privacy.
This Privacy Statement applies only to the SmartMusic website, with a homepage located at
www.smartmusic.com (the “Site” or “Website”). This Privacy Statement does not apply to any other
websites, and you should review the privacy statements of other websites when you visit them. Also, this
Privacy Statement does not apply to information we gather by mail, telephone, or other off-line methods.
This Privacy Statement was last revised on September 19, 2005. We may change this Privacy Statement
at any time and for any reason. We encourage you to look to this Privacy Statement each time you visit
the Site. By using this Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Statement.
PROTECTING YOUR PRIVACY.
The ways we protect and use information collected over this Website depends upon the type of
information involved. In general, personal information – information that tells us who you are – is used
only for limited purposes and receives strong protection. Non-personal information – anonymous
information that does not tell us who you are – is used for many purposes and shared with others, as
described below.
WHAT IS NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Each time a computer visits this Site to read or download information, we may collect certain information
from that computer. This information is automatically collected from the computer’s web browser and
may include information such as the following (“non-personal information”):
           -  the type of web browser software the computer uses (for example, Netscape Navigator or
              Internet Explorer)
           -  the name of the Internet domain from which the computer accessed our Site.
           -  the Internet address of the website from which the computer linked directly to our Site
           -  the date and time the computer accessed our Site
Non-personal information does not tell us who you are.
Also, we may place a text file called a cookie in the browser files of computers that visit this Site. Cookies
are pieces of information issued by a website that, among other things, allow your computer to utilize all
the features on this Site. If and when your computer accepts a cookie, the cookie may be stored on the
computer’s hard drive. The information that we collect using cookies is non-personal information.
US Government Information Bulletin (I-034) contains a good description of cookie technology at:
http://www.ciac.org/ciac/bulletins/i-034.shtml. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser
permits, but some parts of our Site may not work properly for you if you do so.
WHAT DO WE DO WITH NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION?
We will use non-personal information to help us make our Site more useful to visitors and for other
business purposes. For example, we may tell business partners how many computers visited this Site or


what type of music exercises are most popular. Also, we may use the non-personal information in
cookies to help us to personalize this Site according to the preferences you tell us, and make your visit a
more convenient experience. We may prepare reports and other materials using non-personal
information. Since these reports and materials contain no personal information, we may share them with
others.
WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION?
In the process of registering for a username and password, and in some other places on this Site, some
visitors may have the chance to send us “personal information”. Personal information includes
information that tells us specifically who a person is, such as a person’s name, telephone number, email
address, payment and financial information, or home address.
HOW DO WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?
The only way we learn or collect personal information online is if a visitor chooses to provide us with that
information. For example, if you fill out a form to receive and pay for services through this website, you
will tell us and we will learn your name and some other personal information about you.
Under certain conditions another user may provide us with personal information about another website
user. For example, a teacher may enter into the website a list of names of the students in the teachers’
class.
HOW DO WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION?
If you submit personal information, you agree that we may keep a record of the personal information. For
example, we may keep a record of your name and e-mail address in order to keep track of the username
and password we assigned to you. We also may use personal information to help us in our business,
including but not limited to improving this Site and marketing and product development. You also agree
that we may share personal information with other businesses that help us with these activities. For
example, if you pay for services by credit card, we will share your name with the credit card company,
such as Visa or MasterCard, so that we can get paid. These other companies may not use or share your
personal information with others except for the purpose of assisting us with our business activities
pursuant to our request. Also, we may share personal information, such as an email address or mailing
address, with advertisers, business partners, or other businesses. You agree that we may use your
personal information to mail or email information to you about our products and services.
We may also share personal information in connection with a sale of the Company, transfer of the
Company, or if required to comply with a law, regulation, court order, or other legal process. We may
share personal information to protect our rights or property.
WHAT HAPPENS IF THE PRIVACY STATEMENT CHANGES?
If we decide to make a significant change to our Privacy Statement, we will post a notice on the
homepage of our Site for a period of time after the change is made.
WHAT ABOUT PRIVACY ON OTHER SITES?
This Site may contain links to other websites. We provide these links for your convenience, but we do not
review, control, or monitor the privacy practices of websites operated by others. We are not responsible
for the performance of these sites or for your business dealings with them. Your use of other websites is
subject to the terms and conditions of those sites, including the privacy policies of those sites.
