We collect several types of information on our Site. Personal information is information that identifies an individual or is directly associated with a specific person, such as a customer´s name, mailing address, telephone number, email address, credit card number, or information about activities which can be directly linked to that person, such as his or her purchases ("Personal Information"). Our definition of Personal Information does not include "aggregate" information. Aggregate information is data about use of our Site, such as pages visited on our Site. Aggregate information helps us understand trends and customer needs so that we can better consider new products and services, and tailor existing products and services to customer desires.

We may also collect "Non-personal Information", which is information about you that does not itself identify you individually. Examples of Non-personal Information include age range and gender.
