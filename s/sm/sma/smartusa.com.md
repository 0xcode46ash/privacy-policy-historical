Does UnitedAuto Group collect personal information about me when I access this website?

No. In general, you can visit smartusa.com without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information.

Our web servers collect general information about each visit--such as the domain name of the originating server and the type of browser--and aggregate this information with similar information from other site visits to generate website logs. These logs show, for example, the number of visits within a specific time frame and the average time spent on the site, as well as the frequency particular pages are viewed. We use these web site logs to evaluate and improve our site. We may share this information with our affiliates, advertisers or sponsors for the same purpose.

We do not collect information from web visits that are personally identifiable (such as email addresses), and we do not attempt to link the information our servers collect to individual visitors.
