# smart USA - open your mind to the car that challenges the status quo

####  Does smart USA collect personal information about me when I access this website?

No. In general, you can visit smartusa.com without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information.

Our web servers collect general information about each visit--such as the domain name of the originating server and the type of browser--and aggregate this information with similar information from other site visits to generate website logs. These logs show, for example, the number of visits within a specific time frame and the average time spent on the site, as well as the frequency particular pages are viewed. We use these web site logs to evaluate and improve our site. We may share this information with our affiliates, advertisers or sponsors for the same purpose.

We do not collect information from web visits that are personally identifiable (such as email addresses), and we do not attempt to link the information our servers collect to individual visitors.

####  What does smart USA do with the personal information I voluntarily furnish by, for example, registering with smartusa.com?

We use this information for the purposes for which you furnish it to us. Where we request personal information, our online forms indicate the purposes for which we intend to use your personal information, and we will use the personal information you provide only for those purposes.

For example, we use the personal information (such as your name and e-mail address) when you register at this site for fulfilling transactions and prizes and for providing you promotional material regarding smart USA and its affiliates. Similarly, if you send us an inquiry via email, we use the information you provide to analyze and respond to your email.

If you do not express a preference in an online form, email or other communication with us, we may include you on mailing lists for our products and services (including products and services of our affiliates or their advertisers or sponsors) if we believe you might find this information interesting or useful. If you would prefer not to be included on our lists, please advise us at the time you submit the online form, email or other communication. You may, of course, ask us to remove you from our mailing lists at any time.

We strongly urge you NOT to submit to us sensitive information, such as your Social Security number or credit card information, unless it is absolutely necessary for the purposes of your communication. Even though we strive to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk.

####  Does smart USA encourage minors to provide personal information?

No. We believe that minors should not submit personal information without the consent of their parent or guardian.

Unfortunately, there is no way for us to prevent minors from voluntarily furnishing us this information. Emails sent to us, for example, will automatically include the sender's return email address. Also, a person will sometimes furnish us a home address so that we may send him or her material in response to his or her request. In these situations, we do not know whether or not the sender is a minor when deciding how to handle the information provided. Please contact us if you have any questions regarding personal information that your minor children may have provided us.

####  Who has access to the personal information I provide?

smart USA employees and contractors will have access to the personal information we collect or receive online if they require this information in order to perform their jobs. These people are subject to obligations to smart USA that can restrict dissemination of the information to third parties. We have also established appropriate physical, electronic and managerial practices aimed at protecting the information we collect online from unauthorized access, maintaining data accuracy and ensuring the appropriate use of the information.

There are also circumstances in which we will share information with one of our affiliates or others --such as other companies within the smart USA organization, joint venture partners, marketers, manufactures, suppliers, sponsors and advertisers--because we determine that the person is in a better position to respond to your requests. These companies are in no way authorized to sell, rent or trade your personal information. Your personal information may also be shared with third parties in connection with the sale, transfer or financing of a part of our business or in other special circumstances, including situations when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or that the sharing is necessary to protect the safety, property, or other rights of smart USA, our customers, our employees, or any other person. Examples include protecting the health or safety of customers, addressing crimes committed on smart USA property, or in response to inquiries from law enforcement agencies. If you would prefer that we not furnish your information in this manner, please advise us in advance. You should be aware, however, that this type of instruction might impair our ability to properly respond to you or process the information you provide.

We do not otherwise distribute, sell, trade or license any information collected or received online, including email lists.

####  Does this site use cookies?

Yes, we use cookies to recognize you and your access privileges on this site, to facilitate the interaction between you and this site, and to track site usage. Please note, however, that this site sets cookies only for smart USA, and not for our advertisers, sponsors, affiliates, or others. You may receive cookies from these other parties by virtue of accessing their web sites, but we do not control these cookies.

You, of course, have the option of refusing to accept cookies from this or any other site by, for example, changing your browser preferences or using commercially available software. However, if you refuse the cookies from this site, you may find that some services do not function properly or may be considerably slower.

"Cookies" are small bits of computer code that are transmitted to a user's computer when the user accesses a web site, and then stored on the user's computer for future access by the cookie provider. Cookies are part of the flow of information between a user's computer and web servers, and are widely used on the Web for, among other things, customizing user interaction with web sites.

####  Does this policy apply to smart USA's affiliates or other sites that are linked from this site?

No, this policy applies only to smart USA and this site. As described above, we may share information obtained from this site with our affiliates or others. While we expect that these affiliates or others will respect your privacy in a manner consistent with our policies, we cannot guarantee that they will do so.

If you use this site in connection with the financing or attempted financing of your smart vehicle purchase, you will likely be transferred to the website of our non-affiliated preferred financing source. In such an event, any information you submit will be sent to the financing source and governed by the privacy policy of its website.

We retain the right to change this Privacy Policy. We will post changes to this page in a timely manner. This statement is effective as of 3/1/2011.
