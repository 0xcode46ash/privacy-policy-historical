Key details about how we make sure your information remains private and secure  
  
At SmartBargains.com, we want you to have the best shopping experience possible. And while it is necessary for us to collect certain personal information, we respect and protect your right to privacy. The following is our policy regarding your privacy and the security of your information. If you have any additional questions or concerns, please contact us at [CustomerService@SmartBargains.com](mailto:CustomerService@SmartBargains.com).What Information Do We Collect and How?Registration Information  
SmartBargains.com keeps track of information in order to give you a more enjoyable, convenient shopping experience. When you register (log in), you will be asked for your email address and a password so that we can provide you access to your account in the future. Before completing your first purchase, we will ask you for your name, phone number, email, billing and shipping addresses. This information, along with your credit card number, is necessary to fulfill your order. In addition, we use this information for internal purposes and to comply with any requirements of law. This information may be disclosed to our staff and to third parties involved in the completion of your transaction, the delivery of your order or the support of your use of the SmartBargains.com web site. We may use your email address or phone number to contact you if we have questions about your order. We may also use your email address to notify you about new services or special promotional programs, or send you offers or information if you have opted-in. Emails are sent only to customers who have chosen to receive them (opted-in). At any time, you may stop receiving these emails ([opt out](https://secure.smartbargains.com/subscription_edit.aspx)) if you desire. Logging in does NOT obligate you in any way to SmartBargains.com. In addition, we will keep track of past purchases you have made to provide you with a personalized profile of your shopping history. We may also ask you for information regarding your and your family's shopping preferences and demographics in order for us to better fill your needs. However, all information not necessary to fulfill your order is optional.
