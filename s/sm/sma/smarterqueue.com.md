# SmarterQueue - The smartest way to do social media. Properly

## INTRODUCTION

SmarterQueue provides this Privacy Policy to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) received from users of this website, located at https://smarterqueue.com ("Site" ), and our apps ("Applications").

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason; each version will apply to information collected while it was in place. We will notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy on our Site. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.

Our Site contains links to other websites. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit PII from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the PII you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.

Our primary goals in collecting PII are to provide you with the product and services made available through the Site, including, but not limited, to the Service, to communicate with you, and to manage your registered user account, if you have one.

## WHAT WE RECEIVE OR COLLECT

When you first register with SmarterQueue, and when you use the Services, we collect some PII about you such as:

  * your full name, username, and email address and other contact details
  * the geographic area where you use your computer and mobile devices
  * a unique SmarterQueue user ID (an alphanumeric string) which is assigned to you upon registration
  * other optional information as part of your account profile
  * your IP Address and, when applicable, timestamp related to your consent and confirmation of consent
  * other information submitted by you or your organizational representatives via various methods (phone, email, online forms, surveys, in-person meetings, etc)
  * your billing address and any necessary other information to complete any financial transaction, and when making purchases through the Services
  * user generated content (such as messages, posts, comments, pages, profiles, images, feeds)
  * images or other files that you may publish via our Services
  * information we may receive relating to communications you send us, such as queries or comments concerning our Services



SmarterQueue also automatically collects and receives certain information from your computer or mobile device, including the activities you perform on our Website, and the Applications, the type of hardware and software you are using (for example, your operating system or browser), and information obtained from cookies (see "Cookies and Related Technologies" below). For example, each time you visit the Website or otherwise use the Services, we automatically collect your IP address, browser and device type, access times, the web page from which you came, the regions from which you navigate the web page, and the web page(s) you access (as applicable).

## HOW WE USE DATA

We will never sell, share, or rent your personal information, such as your email address or other PII to any third party or use your e-mail address for unsolicited mail. Any emails sent by SmarterQueue will only be in connection with the provision of agreed services and products. A caveat to this is that SmarterQueue may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your PII, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. In such an instance, you will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if the new entity's planned processing of your information differs materially from that set forth in this Privacy Policy.

We may use your contact information to market to you, and provide you with information about our products and services, including but not limited to our Service. Follow the instructions included in any email and we will promptly remove you from all correspondence.

We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance, billing, customer relationship, database storage and management. We will share your PII with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and security of your data.

If you are a registered user of the Site, you may access and update or correct the information you provided to us by contacting us via the usual channels.

## PAYMENT DATA

The financial information provided by users who subscribe to our paid plans will be transmitted over an encrypted connection (SSL) directly to our payment gateway, and will not be stored by SmarterQueue Ltd.

## COOKIES & RELATED TECHNOLOGIES

Like many websites, we also use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the Site and our service. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. We also use third-party analytics tools which may add their own cookies - these are only used to help us improve the functionality of the service we offer.

Please be aware that disabling cookies will turn off some of the features that make your site experience more efficient, and some of our services will not function properly.

## WHEN WE MAY SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION

Our policy is to only release to a third party the data we collect in the following circumstances:

  * When required by law, such as in response to a valid request from a law enforcement body.
  * When given permission by the user.
  * To designated third parties to resolve or investigate abuse complaints.
  * If necessary to defend legal claims against us by third parties.
  * When we deem it necessary to protect the property or rights of the user community, or this website.



## CHILDREN

Our Services should only be accessed by individuals 13 years old and above. The Services are not designed nor intended for use by children or anyone else under the age of 13.

## SECURITY

SmarterQueue employs reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. We will make any legally-required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored personal data to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

## INFORMATION STORAGE & INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS

Information that we collect may be stored, transferred between, and processed in multiple countries. These countries include countries where we operate, countries where our servers are located, and countries where the third-party services that we use are based.

## YOUR RIGHTS

You can contact us to obtain a copy of the PII held about you by us. This may be subject to a fee not exceeding any prescribed fee permitted by applicable law. You can also ask us to correct and, where relevant, erase that information. Please note that certain PII may need to be retained by SmarterQueue for a period of time following cancellation of your account where this is necessary for our legitimate business purposes or required or authorized by applicable law. As mentioned above you have a right to change your email preferences at any time. 

You should be aware that SmarterQueue acts as a conduit between our users and the various Supported Platforms and Third-Party Apps (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram). In several instances, the content published via SmarterQueue will not be in SmarterQueue's custody or control, and any content that has been shared by you through any Supported Platform or Third-Party Apps via the Services may continue to be available to third parties and the public at large, as this content is now under the control of the operators of the Supported Platforms and/or the Third-Party Apps.
