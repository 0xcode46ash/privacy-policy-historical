# Privacy Statement - SmileCity New Zealand

  
  
**SmileCity understands that you are concerned about your privacy. That's why SmileCity has created this privacy and permission statement, to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy.**

**How does SmileCity use the information I provide?**  
SmileCity uses the information you provide to target and personalise the emails we send to you and the offers we make available to you. We do this to ensure that you only receive relevant and appropriate information.

**SmileCity will not sell or give away your personal information** to any other person, company or organisation, unless:

  1. it is required by law, or;  

  2. you expressly agree to us giving out your information.

  
Demographic and profile data is only shared with SmileCity clients and advertisers on an aggregate or collective basis. For example, we might tell our clients that 3680 of our members live in a particular town or suburb, or that 43% of our members have indicated an interest in sport. However, we will never tell our clients your name, your postal address or your email address and other such information.

**What about security?**  
SmileCity has modern and robust security measures in place to protect the information you give to us from loss, misuse and alteration. We are constantly reviewing and upgrading these security measures to ensure the very best of protection to you.

**Why does SmileCity record IP Addresses?**  
When a user joins SmileCity, our computers may record their IP address. In the event that we detect fraud or abuse of our programme or our Web site and computers, we may use the IP address of the offender to take action against them. Ultimately this ensures greater protection for you and your personal information.

**What are cookies and why does SmileCity use them?**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on a userâ€™s computer hard drive, containing information about that user. A cookie can only be accessed across the Internet by the Web site that placed it there. Cookies are used by the SmileCity Web site to add functionality and security.

You may choose to reject a cookie that the SmileCity Web site attempts to place on your computer, however you may then be limited in your use of some areas of the Web site. The use of cookies in this way is wide-spread and commonly accepted by the Internet community.

**What about other Web sites?**  
The SmileCity Web site contains links to other Web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other Web sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Web site and to read the privacy statements of other Web sites that you use. This privacy statement applies only to Web sites owned and operated by SmileCity Ltd.

**What is "spam" and does SmileCity send it?**  
The widely accepted definition of "spam" is unsolicited commercial email, or in other words, email of a commercial nature that the recipient does not want. **SmileCity does not send "spam".** This is because as a SmileCity member, you have the choice to opt-in or opt-out of SmileCity emails.

**How many emails will I receive?**  
We respect your time and attention. If you request to receive emails, we will never send to you more than seven advertising emails per week. That is a guarantee.

**How can I stop SmileCity from sending me email?**  
Each email we send to you contains a link at the very bottom allowing you to unsubscribe.
