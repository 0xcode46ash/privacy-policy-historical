# Privacy Policy - SmileCity

Privacy Policy

##### SmileCity understands that you are concerned about your privacy. That's why SmileCity has created this privacy and permission statement, to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy.

  


##### How does SmileCity use the information I provide in the Account Settings and Rewards Profile?

SmileCity uses the information you provide in your Account Settings and Rewards Profile to target and personalise the emails, surveys and letters we send to you and the offers we make available to you. We do this to ensure that you only receive relevant and appropriate information.

Demographic and profile data is only shared with SmileCity clients and advertisers on an aggregate or collective basis. For example, we might tell our clients that 3680 of our members live in a particular town or suburb, or that 43% of our members have indicated an interest in sport.

Your personally identifiable information such as your name, address or email address will never be sold to any third party. Your personally identifiable information may be shared with a third party if it is required by law. Your personally identifiable information may also be shared with a third party (for example a supplier or partner of ours) if it is necessary for us to process a transaction that you request, or if you opt-in to a service or feature where we outsource some aspects of the provision of that service or feature. For example, if you opt in to the Postal Rewards feature, we may share your postal address with a mail processing company that sends mail to you on our behalf. We have strict legal agreements in place that prevent any third party from using that information more than once, or for any purpose beyond what is allowed for in the agreement.

##### What is the Community Profile and what happens to the information I provide there?

The Community Profile is a separate section, unrelated to the Rewards Profile. Filling in your Community Profile is completely optional. Any information you enter and any photo you upload to the Community Profile is published on the web site and available for viewing by the public. Therefore if you wish to use the Community Profile feature, you should only enter information of a general nature that you are comfortable sharing publicly.

##### What happens to the answers I give in an online survey?

SmileCity follows strict market research guidelines that govern what happens to the answers that you give when participating in an online survey. The results of online surveys (where you are invited to participate in the survey by email) are only used for market research analysis. The information you give in these online surveys is not used to target direct marketing messages. You can be assured that any information you provide in an online survey is kept absolutely confidential.

##### What about security?

SmileCity has modern and robust security measures in place to protect the information you give to us from loss, misuse and alteration. We are constantly reviewing and upgrading these security measures to ensure the very best of protection to you.

##### Why does SmileCity record IP Addresses?

When a user joins SmileCity, our computers may record their IP address. In the event that we detect fraud or abuse of our program or our Web site and computers, we may use the IP address of the offender to take action against them. Ultimately this ensures greater protection for you and your personal information.

##### What are cookies and why does SmileCity use them?

A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's computer hard drive, containing information about that user. A cookie can only be accessed across the Internet by the Web site that placed it there. Cookies are used by the SmileCity Web site to add functionality and security.

You may choose to reject a cookie that the SmileCity Web site attempts to place on your computer, however you may then be limited in your use of some areas of the Web site. The use of cookies in this way is wide-spread and commonly accepted by the Internet community.

##### What about other Web sites?

The SmileCity Web site contains links to other Web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other Web sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Web site and to read the privacy statements of other Web sites that you use. This privacy statement applies only to Web sites owned and operated by SmileCity Ltd.

##### What is "spam" and does SmileCity send it?

The widely accepted definition of "spam" is unsolicited commercial email, or in other words, email of a commercial nature that the recipient does not want. **SmileCity does not send "spam".** This is because when you join SmileCity, you must expressly agree to allow us to send to you commercial advertising email.

##### How many emails will I receive?

We respect your time and attention. We will never send to you more than fourteen advertising emails per week. That is a guarantee.

##### How can I stop SmileCity from sending me email?

Each email we send to you contains a link at the very bottom allowing you to unsubscribe.
