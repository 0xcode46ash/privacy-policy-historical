# Privacy Policy - SmileCity

SmileCity (" **SC** ") is a fun New Zealand's online community to provide sampling solutions and technology for survey research, providing clients with access to consumer respondents via internet. ,. SC serves a vast array of for-profit and not-for profit businesses, universities and governmental agencies and departments. This Privacy Policy sets forth the collection, use and disclosure of personal data or personally identifiable information (" **PII** ") and other information by SC in connection with SC's Services (as defined herein). SC's Services provide you with the opportunity to join a Panel (as defined herein), participate in surveys (whether as a Panel member or a non-Panel member), use the websites associated with the Panels, and receive and redeem rewards and incentives, including, without limitation, sweepstakes entries, offered in connection with Panel membership and/or the completion of surveys (collectively " **Services** "). Registration with, use of, and access to SC's Services is subject to SC's [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/terms.aspx). Your use of SC's Services is completely voluntary and therefore SC's processing of your PII in connection with the Services and this Privacy Policy is with your consent. SC strives to conform its privacy practices to applicable laws, codes, and regulations, and the codes of standards of applicable market and opinion survey research associations, including, without limitation, ASMOR,. For clarification, except for Panels that have a separate privacy policy, this Privacy Policy applies to all of SC's survey research panels, including, without limitation, SmileCity (each a " **Panel** " and collectively the " **Panels** "). All references in this Privacy Policy to SC include SC and its parent, subsidiary and affiliated companies. All references to "us" or "we" refer to SC. 

All PII is currently stored on servers located in New Zealand. However, we may without further notice to you, elect to store such PII on servers located in the United States, (" **US** ") - In the event we elect to do so, we agree that we will comply with the European Union (" **EU** ") and US - Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data from EU member countries and Switzerland. 

For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, the term " **PII** " shall include, without limitation, your name, address(es), telephone number(s) (including home, cell, and/or business telephone numbers), email address(es), date of birth, the unique identification number we assign to you (individually a " **UID** " and collectively " **UIDs** "), reward, loyalty, or incentive account numbers, and Sensitive Data (as defined herein).

_SC's Online Ad Effectiveness Program._

In connection with SC's online ad effectiveness program, you can participate in surveys regarding specific ads and promotions that SC is testing for its clients. To facilitate the completion of these surveys, SC's clients may write, set, or read cookies, locally shared/stored objects, flash cookies and/or any other related technology (each a " **Third Party Technology** " and collectively the " **Third Party Technologies** "). The Third Party Technologies may be written, set or read in various locations, including, without limitation, SC's servers or systems. If you participate, your UID will be stored in or associated with the Third Party Technology to allow you to be re-contacted about the online ad or promotion and SC's client will use the Third Party Technology to determine whether you have seen, clicked on, or otherwise interacted with the online ad or promotion. If you have interacted with the online ad or promotion, SC's client will send your UID and the specific survey to SC and SC will provide you with the opportunity to complete the survey. Additionally, if you participate, SC may share your UID and data previously collected by SC, including, without limitation, age, gender, income, number of people in your household, education/education level, and employment status, (" **Audience Measurement Data** "), to third parties, including, without limitation, SC's subcontractors, partners, and/or clients for the purpose of audience measurement reporting on the advertisements, campaigns, and websites that you visit, view, and/or click on. The Audience Measurement Data will be used to assist in the creation, development, and implementation of websites, online advertisements, and other Internet and digital media features, functionality, and campaigns. Audience Measurement Data may be shared in a single summary form (i.e. individual respondent level) or aggregate summary form (i.e. group of respondents).
