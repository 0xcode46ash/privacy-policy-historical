### The Type of Information the Site Collects About You

SmileDirectClub collects information that you provide to us or that we learn about you from your use of the Site. For example, you may provide information to the Site when you register, search, add items to your shopping cart, participate in a survey, rate or review our products or services, or communicate with SmileDirectClub's Patient Care department online. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information as your name, address, phone number, email address, and personal shopping and product preferences. We also automatically receive and store certain types of non-personal information, such as demographic or statistical information, whenever you visit the Site. 

### HIPPA

Our privacy practices are intended to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA"). We will maintain the privacy of your Health Information as required by HIPAA and the regulations promulgated under that Act. 

### Third Party Services

Our customers are active in many different communities, both offline and online, such as Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, YouTube or Google+ accounts ("Third Party Accounts"). If you link to Third Party Accounts from our Services, we may collect some information about your use of the Third Party Account. We will only be able to collect the information if you've authorized the Third Party Service to provide us with that information or if you've made the information public. 

Additionally, if you mention us through your Third Party Account, we may collect information and content related to your comment that is publicly available. If you wish to limit the information available to us, you should be sure to manage the privacy settings of your Third Party Accounts. One thing we won't ever store is your Third Party Account password. 

If you link your account on the Services with a Third Party Account, we may also collect and store publicly available information about your contacts and friends from the linked Third Party Account. This information may include their photo, name, email address, birthday, interests or other content you can see when you access such profiles on those Third Party Services. We may also collect and store information if you invite other users to the Services by providing us with their Personal Information. 

### How SmileDirectClub Uses and Shares Information About You

We try to provide you with the information you need to make informed, reasonable choices with respect to how the Site uses or shares your information. SmileDirectClub uses and shares personal information from you in several ways: 

We use information we have collected about you to provide you with the very best products and services, shopping experience and to operate our business. We do not sell your personal information to third parties for any reason. We do not disclose your personal information to unaffiliated third parties who may want to offer you their own products and services unless you have requested or authorized us to do so. 

We may share your personal information with third parties or affiliates of SmileDirectClub where it is necessary for us to complete a transaction or do something you have asked us to do. Likewise, we may share your personal information with third parties or affiliates of SmileDirectClub with whom we have contracted to perform services on our behalf. Companies that act on our behalf are required to keep the personal information we provide to them confidential and to use the personal information we share only to provide the services we ask them to perform. 

We may disclose your personal information as permitted or required by law, such as in connection with a subpoena or similar legal process, or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy, as discussed further below. 

### Website Usage

SmileDirectClub or its authorized service providers may observe activities, preferences and transactional data (such as your IP address, browser type and operating system) relating to your use of the Site. This information is generally collected in non-personally identifiable format. We may use this collected or logged information in order to provide better service, to facilitate our customers' use of the Site, to track usage of the Site, to address security hazards, and for other administrative or operational purposes. SmileDirectClub, or its authorized service providers, may use this information to track aggregate traffic patterns throughout the Site. We may use aggregated, statistical information to describe our customer audience, products, and services, and to develop partnerships with third parties to offer products and services in which we believe our customers will be interested. 

### Our Security Practices

Except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy, our internal data security policies restrict access to customers' personal information to authorized employees for SmileDirectClub business purposes only. Our employees are bound by SmileDirectClub policies that require them to maintain the confidentiality of our customers' personal information. Employees who violate these requirements are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that are designed to guard our customers' personal information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, SmileDirectClub cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit such information at your own risk. 

### What Are Cookies and How Does This Site Use Them

We may use cookies to collect or log certain information. A cookie is a small piece of information that a Site stores on a personal computer and which it can later retrieve. We may use cookies for some administrative purposes, for example, to store our customers' preferences for certain kinds of products or to store a password so that you do not have to input it every time you visit our Site. The cookies will not contain personal information that will enable anyone to contact our customers via telephone, email, or other means. This information will not be sold or shared with any third party not contracted with SmileDirectClub. If our customers are uncomfortable with the use of cookie technology, they can set their browsers to refuse cookies. Certain services, however, could be dependent on cookies and our customers may disable those services by refusing cookies. 

### Links to Third-Party Sites

The Site may contain links to third-party sites. Please be aware, however, that SmileDirectClub is not responsible for and cannot control the privacy policies of these other sites or their practices. We encourage you to read the privacy policies for these other sites, as they may differ from ours. This Site may also contain links to sites that display SmileDirectClub branding and/or SmileDirectClub's logo but which are maintained by third parties. Such websites are identified as third party sites by the website address or URL because they do not display a SmileDirectClub.com URL. Please read the privacy policy on these sites for applicable privacy practices relating to personal information collected via the sites because they may differ from the Site's privacy practices. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by SmileDirectClub via the Site. 

### Contact Preferences and Accessing Your Personal Information

You have choices when it comes to how SmileDirectClub uses your personal information. When you register online with or purchase items from the Site or otherwise provide your email address to us, you are automatically signed up to receive information about merchandise, services and special promotional offers from us by email and/or direct mail. If you do not wish to receive such product marketing information, please contact us by email or direct mail to unsubscribe at support@SmileDirectClub.com or SmileDirectClub, 414 Union Street, Suite 800, Nashville, TN 37219. If you elect not to receive such product marketing information, SmileDirectClub may continue to contact you as necessary to service your account and process your transactions and requests. 

### This Privacy and Security Policy Applies to U.S. Customers

The Site is hosted in the United States and is intended for U.S. visitors. This Privacy Policy applies to residents of the United States. Parts of this Privacy Policy may not apply to visitors outside the United States. If you are a non-U.S. visitor to our Site, by visiting our Site and providing us with data, you acknowledge, agree and provide your consent that your personal information may be processed in the United States for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy. In addition, such data may be stored on servers located outside your resident jurisdiction, which may have less stringent privacy practices than your own and that email communications directly between you and SmileDirectClub may not be secure. By using this Site and providing us with your data, you consent to the transfer of such data. 

### Mergers, Acquisitions and Bankruptcy

If SmileDirectClub should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company, or if SmileDirectClub should decide to buy another business, or sell or reorganize part or all of SmileDirectClub's business, SmileDirectClub may be required to disclose your personal information to prospective or actual purchasers and other parties. It is SmileDirectClub's practice to obtain appropriate confidentiality protections for information disclosed in these types of transactions.

The Site is not intended for use by minor children (under the age of 18). Parents and guardians should monitor the use of the Site by minor children. Children under age 13 should not use the Site at all. If a child under age 13 submits information through any part of the Site, and SmileDirectClub becomes aware that the person submitting the information is under age 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.
