_Our Commitment To Privacy_  
Your privacy is important to Smith Micro. We recognize that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a responsible manner. To better protect this personal information we provide this notice explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used to personalize your experience with Smith Micro.

Smith Micro is committed to taking reasonable steps to protect your personal information that we collect. An example is when you provide us with a credit/debit card number (and other sensitive information). Smith Micro will assure that we protect this information through a secure (SSL - Secure Socket Layers) connection.

This Privacy Statement is made available in order to make you aware of how Smith Micro collects and uses personal information of visitors to our website or through other means. We collect the following information while you are downloading trial versions of our products, placing an order, registering a product, requesting technical or customer support, answering a survey, corresponding to us or engaging in any other activities with Smith Micro. For example:

  * When placing an order we gather your name, company (if applicable), billing and/or shipping address, telephone number, email address, and credit/debit card number in order for us to complete the transaction;

  * On some website pages, you can make requests to receive materials where the types of personal information collected at these pages are typically name, address, phone number, email address, etc.; and
  * On some website pages, you can submit information about other people.

In this circumstance, the types of personal information collected are: name, address, phone number, etc. 



You make the decision whether to continue with any activity that requests personal information. Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.

_Log Files_  
We use IP addresses in web server log files to analyze trends, administer the site, track a user's movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Such information in log files does not enable us to access personally identifying information, such as email addresses.

_Use of Cookies_  
A cookie is a small data file that a web site may send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your email address. As is standard practice on many corporate websites, the Smith Micro web site uses cookies during the order process to help keep track of items in your shopping cart. Cookies also allow us to "remember" your login information if applicable, simulating a continuous connection, and allowing you to move within areas of our Web site without reintroducing yourself. Although our cookies may contain a unique user ID, they do not collect or store any of your personally identifiable information.

Most people do not know that cookies are being placed on their computers when they visit the SmithMicro.com site or most web sites because browsers are typically set to accept cookies. You can choose to have your browser warn you every time a cookie is being sent to you or you can turn off cookie placement. If you refuse cookies, you will not be able to open a SmithMicro.com shopping cart and therefore will not be able to complete an order with us online. You will also not be able to login to any accounts created on SmithMicro.com. In addition, by not using cookies, your overall Internet browsing experience will be affected.

_Email Marketing Campaigns_  
To help us understand the effectiveness of our email marketing efforts, SmithMicro.com may use "message open" sensing technology which require the use of pixel tags or clear GIFs (also called web beacons).
