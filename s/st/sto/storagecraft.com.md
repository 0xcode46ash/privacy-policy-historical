## WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT CUSTOMERS DOES STORAGECRAFT GATHER?

### Trial and Evaluation Software.

If you download a free trial of StorageCraft software, we collect your name, telephone number, email address, IP address, and country. If you request a full-featured evaluation copy of our software, we also collect your job title, address, organization name, and some general information about your organization, such as size and intended use of the evaluation software.

### Product Registration.

When you register a StorageCraft software product, we collect your name, organization name, address, telephone number, email address, and IP address.

### MSP and Cloud Services Customers.

In managing your MSP or Cloud Services account, we may also allow you to enter sub-account information of your choosing. This information is not required, but may be comprised of information like your customer’s name or a customer-identification code that you have assigned to them. Be aware that if you choose to provide this information in managing your sub-accounts, we may capture that data and repeat it on billing statements or usage reports that we provide to you. In the event you provide this sub-account information, you represent that you are complying with relevant data privacy laws and, to the extent necessary, have obtained any required third-party consents.

### Web Store Customers.

When you place an order through StorageCraft’s web store, you provide us with account information that includes company name (when applicable), your name, address(es), telephone number, email address, IP address, and credit card information.

### Support Customers.

When you request technical support, you provide us with your name, email address, company name, telephone number, state or province, and country.

### StorageCraft Forum.

If you participate in the StorageCraft forum, you are asked to provide a name and an email address. If you choose to do so, you can also provide your job title; organization; a Twitter, Facebook, and/or LinkedIn link; and your location.

### Reseller Partners.

If you are a StorageCraft reseller partner, we collect your business name, business address, business telephone number, email address(es), and the names of people at your business that we can contact for technical and account-related issues.

## HOW DOES STORAGECRAFT USE COOKIES?

Cookies are files sent to your web browser and stored on your computer. They are unique identifiers that allow our systems to recognize your computer, let us know you have visited before, and tell us the pages you visited on our websites. They also preserve information when you search our websites to make your searches more productive, such as when you search our support website for knowledge-base articles or white papers. Cookies also remember information like your language preference. If you do not want StorageCraft to send cookies to your web browser, you can set your browser options to reject cookies or notify you that our website is attempting to put a cookie into your browser. Be mindful, however, that rejecting cookies may affect your ability to use StorageCraft websites and services.

## HOW DOES STORAGECRAFT USE MY INFORMATION?

StorageCraft uses the information you provide to us: (a) to allow StorageCraft and our partners to deliver StorageCraft products and services to you and (b) to tell you about other StorageCraft products and services we think may be of interest to you. When you provide your information to us, you are consenting to our use of the information in this way. StorageCraft does not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to third parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or providing you with our products or services, so long as those third parties agree to keep this information confidential. If you are a StorageCraft Cloud Services customer, StorageCraft will not view the contents of the backup images you store in the StorageCraft Cloud. StorageCraft, however, may view file folder names, file extensions, file size information, and the like in order to deliver Cloud Services and associated technical support to you, but never the contents of your backup files. Except as described in this paragraph, StorageCraft will not disclose your personal information to third parties unless disclosure is necessary to comply with the law or to deliver the products or services you have contracted to receive from us.

## SECURITY

StorageCraft takes security seriously. That includes protecting the security of information we have about you, as well as honoring your wishes concerning the intended use of your information. We use security measures on our websites to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information in our control. These security measures include use of SSL, firewalls, encryption and passwords. The Internet, however, is an open environment and data may flow across various networks, some of which employ inadequate security measures, resulting in unauthorized access to data. While it is impossible to completely protect a website, StorageCraft works hard to keep your data safe.

## WHAT INFORMATION CAN I ACCESS?

StorageCraft gives you access to a range of information about your account and your interactions with StorageCraft. If you are a user of a StorageCraft portal, such as the MSP or Cloud Services Portals, you can view much of the information we have about you. You can also call your StorageCraft salesperson or account representative to obtain the information we have about you, as well as change or update that information.

## CONDITIONS OF USE AND CHANGES TO STORAGECRAFT PRIVACY POLICIES

This Policy and StorageCraft’s Conditions of Use [www.storagecraft.com/legal/conditions-of-use](https://web.archive.org/legal/conditions-of-use) apply to your visit to a StorageCraft website, as well as any associated dispute over privacy. This includes rules governing limitations on liability and damages, and how and where a dispute will be resolved. If you have concerns about StorageCraft’s Privacy Policy, please let us know by emailing us at [privacy@storagecraft.com](mailto:privacy@storagecraft.com?subject=feedback). Include a thorough description of your concerns and we will try to address them. StorageCraft and its product and service offerings are growing fast. That means our Privacy Policy and Conditions of Use will change from time to time. When those changes occur, we may send you an email or reference those changes in our MSP, Reseller, or Cloud Services Portals. But please check StorageCraft.com periodically to see if changes have occurred. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account.
