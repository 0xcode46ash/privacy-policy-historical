# Privacy Policy | StorageCraft

This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) explains how StorageCraft Technology Corporation (“StorageCraft”) gathers and uses information you provide to us.  We have created this Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. _By visiting StorageCraft ® websites or using StorageCraft products or services, you are accepting the practices described in this Policy._ _If you do not agree with any aspect of this Policy, your only remedy is to discontinue your use of this website, our products, and our services._ This Privacy Policy describes the ways in which any information we collect from you or that you provide to us will be processed by us. In order to fully understand your rights, we encourage you to read this Privacy Policy and to consult our [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://www.storagecraft.com/about/legal/terms-conditions-use).

## _1.   INFORMATION WE COLLECT_

**Personally Identifiable Information.  **This is information you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, residential address, or other data that permits the identity of an individual to be directly or indirectly inferred.  You may visit our websites without providing any personally identifiable information to us.  The only personally identifiable information StorageCraft collects and stores is the information that you choose to provide to us via an "opt-in" method, where you must affirmatively choose to provide StorageCraft with your personally identifiable information.

**Trial and Evaluation Software.**   If you download a free trial of StorageCraft software, we collect your name, company name, telephone number, email address, IP address, state or province, and country.  If you request a full-featured evaluation copy of our software, we also collect your job title, address, and some general information about your organization, such as size and intended use of the evaluation software.  

**Product Registration.**   When you register a StorageCraft product, we collect your name, organization name, address, telephone number, and email address.

**Product Activation.** When you activate a StorageCraft product, we collect your name, organization name, email address (optional), machine and hardware ID, and IP address.

**MSP and Cloud Services Customers.**   If you are a StorageCraft Managed Service Provider (“MSP”) or a StorageCraft Cloud Services™ customer, StorageCraft collects information relevant to your subscription with StorageCraft, including company name, company address, company telephone number, email address(es), state or province, country, and the names of people at your company that we can contact for technical and account-related issues. We may also collect credit card information or information necessary for you to pay directly from your bank account (see below).  In managing your MSP or Cloud Services account, we may also allow you to enter sub-account information of your choosing. This information is not required, but may be comprised of information like your customer’s name or a customer-identification code that you have assigned to them.  Be aware that if you choose to provide this information in managing your sub-accounts, we may capture that data and repeat it on billing statements or usage reports that we provide to you.  In the event you provide this sub-account information, you represent that you are complying with relevant data privacy laws and, to the extent necessary, have obtained any required third-party consents to do so.

**Local Reseller Inquiries.** If you would like information about local resellers of StorageCraft products, we ask you to provide your name, email address, telephone number, company name, state or province, and country.

**Web Store Customers.   **When you place an order through StorageCraft’s web store, you provide us with account information that includes company name (when applicable), your name, address(es), telephone number, email address, IP address, and credit card information (see below). 

**Credit Card and Bank Account Information.**   If you provide us with credit card or bank account information, we never store that information.  We use a trusted third-party payment processor, Authorize.Net® Merchant Services, to process all payments.

**Support Customers.   **When you request technical support, you provide us with your company name, and the name, email address, and telephone number of people at your company that we can contact.

**StorageCraft Forum.**   If you participate in the StorageCraft Forum, you are asked to provide a name and an email address. If you choose to do so, you can also provide your job title; organization; a Twitter, Facebook, and/or LinkedIn link; and your location.  You understand that StorageCraft has no responsibility or liability for the privacy of any information you post to a StorageCraft website, such as the StorageCraft Forum.

**StorageCraft Partners.**   If you contact us to inquire about becoming a StorageCraft MSP, OEM, or reseller partner, we collect your company name, company address, company telephone number, email address(es), and the names of people at your company that we can contact for technical and account-related issues.  When you place an order, we also collect the name, company name, company address, company telephone number, email address, and fax number of the end user for which you are placing the order.

## _2.   SECURING AND STORING YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION_

StorageCraft takes security seriously.  That includes protecting the security of information we have about you, as well as honoring your wishes concerning the intended use of your information.  We use security measures on our websites to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information in our control.  These security measures include use of SSL, firewalls, encryption and passwords.  The Internet, however, is an open environment ,and data may flow across various networks, some of which employ inadequate security measures, resulting in unauthorized access to data.  Transmission of such data is therefore entirely at your own risk.  While it is impossible to completely protect a website, StorageCraft works hard to keep your data safe. 

Any information you provide to us that is stored is done so on our secure servers.  Details relating to any transactions will be transmitted using SSL technology.

## _3.   USE OF YOUR INFORMATION_

StorageCraft uses the information you provide to us to: (a) allow StorageCraft, our corporate affiliates, and our business partners to deliver StorageCraft products and services to you; (b) provide you with information you have requested from us; (c) carry out our obligations arising from any contracts we have entered into with you; (d) notify you about changes to our website and/or products and services; and (e) tell you about other StorageCraft products and services we believe may be of interest to you.  When you provide your information to us, you are consenting to our use of the information in this way.  StorageCraft does not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to third parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in conducting our business, providing you with our products or services, or offering our products or services. If you are a StorageCraft Cloud Services customer, StorageCraft will not view the contents of the backup images you store in the StorageCraft Cloud.  StorageCraft, however, may view file folder names, file extensions, file size information, and the like in order to deliver Cloud Services and associated technical support to you, but never the contents of your backup files.  Except as described in this Policy, StorageCraft will not disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties unless we obtain your consent, disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, or disclosure is necessary to deliver the products or perform the services you have contracted to receive from us.

StorageCraft, for strategic or other business reasons, could at some time decide to sell, buy, merge, or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure or transfer to prospective or actual purchasers of personally identifiable information that StorageCraft, or its designee, has in its possession.  It is StorageCraft’s practice to handle such transactions in a manner consistent with this Policy.

Our website may, from time to time, contain links to third-party websites.  If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies.
