### SVS’s Commitment to Privacy

Your privacy is important to SVS. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices. This policy does not apply to Web sites that may be accessed through links from SVS’ Web site, such as companies that may advertise on SVS’ Web site. This policy applies to personal information that may be collected by, or submitted to, SVS through its Web site. 

### Collecting Your Information

When you visit our site, we may collect information from you that we might use to provide services, contact you with information on our products and services, maintain security or improve our site usability. 

### Personally Identifiable Information

From time to time, we may request information that personally identifies you such as your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, or other information that can be used to identify you. We may use this information to contact you with surveys or news and information about our products and services. 

### Automatically Collected Information 

If you visit SVS’ Web site and do nothing more than browse the site, read pages, or download information, SVS will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This information does not identify you personally. SVS collects and stores indefinitely your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, as well as information about the date and time of your visit, whether a file you have requested exists, and how many "bytes" of information were transmitted to you over the Web from this site. An IP address is a series of numbers that identifies each computer and machine connected to the Internet. It does not identify you personally. SVS may use your IP address to assess the frequency of visits to its Web site and the popularity of its various pages and functions. SVS does not attempt to match any personally identifiable information that you provide to us with your IP address. 

### Use of Cookies 

SVS may use "cookies" to keep track of login name and password and/or to tailor our Web contents to our user's interests. Cookies are files that a Web site can place on your computer. A cookie file allows the Web site to recognize you as you click through pages on the site and when you later revisit the site. A Web site can use cookies to "remember" your preferences, and to record your browsing behavior on the Web. Although you can prevent Web sites from placing cookies on your computer by using your browser's preference menu, disabling cookies may affect your ability to view or interact with SVS’ Web site. 

### Dissemination of Your Information 

SVS does not sell or rent any personally identifiable information collected through its Web site. Occasionally, we may share personally identifiable information with trusted third party vendors and affiliates in order to provide the services you use or to administer our Web site. In addition, we may be required to disclose your personally identifiable information to a third party such as in the case of the sale of all or a portion of our business or assets, or if required to do so by law or to comply with judicial or governmental investigations. 

### Use of Information for Marketing Purposes 

Some areas of SVS’ Web site may offer users the option to receive marketing information from SVS such as information on new products and services. If you do not want to receive such information, simply "uncheck" the box that states you agree to receive such materials. If the box remains unchecked, you will automatically receive such marketing information. However, at any time, you can opt out of receiving further marketing information from SVS by e-mailing us at [webmaster@storedvalue.com](mailto:webmaster@storedvalue.com). 

### Security 

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, SVS has put into place the appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

### Policy Changes 

We may change this privacy policy at any time in our sole discretion. Any updates to our privacy policy will be posted on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. Continued use of the SVS Web site following our posting of the change notice or an updated privacy policy will constitute binding acceptance of those changes. 

### Contact Information 

For questions about your privacy while visiting SVS’ Web site, please e-mail SVS at [webmaster@storedvalue.com](mailto:webmaster@storedvalue.com).
