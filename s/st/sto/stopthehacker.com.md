# Privacy Policy

**In what circumstances will StopTheHacker Inc., a Delaware corporation (“STH”) share information about its customers and website visitors with others?**

STH’s only purpose in collecting information about its customers is the furtherance of the business it conducts at and through the STH website.  STH never sells information about individual customers to third parties.  We may, however, share information about our customers in the following circumstances:

1.          **In order to enable the work of some of our service providers**.  From time to time, STH may contract with third parties for performance of some of its business functions.  Examples may include marketing analysis and customer service functions.  While these third parties will have access to customer information in order to perform their functions, such data may not be used by them for other purposes.

2.          **When data regarding individual customers are aggregated**.  STH may share with third parties certain aggregated, non-personal information, such as aggregated data about usage of services in a particular geographical area.  In no way will such information include the identity of any STH customer.

3.          **For overriding considerations**.  STH will release information about its customers when it deems that legal or safety concerns override a customer’s reasonable expectation of privacy.  For example, such a disclosure may occur in compliance with instructions from a court or requests from law enforcement officials, in order to fully enforce our Terms and Conditions of Use [ _link_ ], or to protect the safety and property of others, including by coordinating with other businesses to prevent fraud and reduce credit risks.  However, in no case will this include the commercial use of customers’ account information in any way inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.

4.          **Upon the transfer of our business**.  If StopTheHacker Inc. or some or all of its STH business is acquired by another company, then customer data may be transferred, by operation of law or by agreement, along with the other assets of the business.

**What information does STH collect about its customers?**

STH may collect and retain information it receives about its customers from a number of sources.  These include:

A.        Data Inputted by the Customer.  Anyone using STH services that require registration may provide identifying or payment information (such as a name, email or mailing address, credit card information, account password, etc.).

B.        Information Tracked with Cookies.  Regardless of whether a customer’s experience of the STH website involves registration or the creation of a purchase order, we send one or more “cookies” to visitors to the site in order to uniquely identify their browsers.  STH can then use these cookies to track customer preferences.

C.        Server Log Data.  STH’s servers may automatically record information they receive from a customer’s browser during a visit to our website.  The resulting server logs may include information such as a customer’s web requests, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of web requests and cookies that may uniquely identify the customer’s browser.

D.        Customer Communications.  When customers send email or other communication to STH, we may retain those communications in order to process requests, respond to inquiries and improve our services.

E.         Information Received from Others.  STH may receive data that customers of the STH website have provided to third parties, such as vendor partners of STH.  While such third parties may have their own privacy policies, we will, for our part, treat all such information as if it were provided directly from the customer to STH under this Privacy Policy.

F.         Hyperlinks.  The STH website may present hyperlinks in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed.  We may use this information to improve the quality of our service and customized content and advertising for particular classes of customers.

**How secure is the customer information gathered by STH?**

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data we maintain.  We restrict access to personal information of our customers to STH’s employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services.
