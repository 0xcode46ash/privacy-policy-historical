# Privacy Policy

   
---  
  
**Summary**

Stockshifters is committed to protecting your privacy, and takes its responsibilities regarding the security of information provided to us by customers very seriously. This policy explains how we use any information you provide to us, and how we protect your privacy.

  


In essence, we do not ask you for any more information than would reasonably be asked of any business seeking to carry out transactions with another business. 

We particularly draw to your attention this extract from the following detailed policies: Stockshifters is a business to business site. Given proper proof both of the identity of the persons representing an organisation, and of their relevant position in the organisation, we undertake to disclose to any organisation the full details of any information we hold about any registrants or transactions undertaken on the organisation's behalf. For this reason, when entering information on behalf of an organisation, including information about yourself as an employee or representative of the organisation, you should be clearly aware that that information could be disclosed, on reasonable demand, to properly accredited representatives of that organisation.   
  
   
  
**How we use Information provided by you to us**

_Information required to register you as a bidder_   
We require certain information to allow us to process your bids. This includes your name, your job title and the organisation for which you work, your telephone number and email address, and normally your business address. For some auctions, where the lots have a value over a certain amount of money, we also may need to request your debit card number and expiry date, or other credit information. We need to know this to protect the interests of bona-fide bidders and vendors alike. Unfortunately, even business-to-business sites can be subject to abuse by time-wasters; and no-one is helped by finding out that a bidder for an important piece of equipment cannot raise the money, so that the whole process has to be gone through again.

This information allows us to process your bids, and to send you confirmation of successful or unsuccessful bids by email. We ask for your telephone number so that we can contact you urgently if there is a problem with your bid - for example, if we discover something about a lot which might materially affect your decision to bid for it, or the value you would place on it.   
  
  
**E-mail and Personal Information Services**

By registering with us and indicating your agreement to receive information about relevant auctions, you will receive latest news, updates and information about items that fit your interests. Clearly, the more information you give to us about where your interests may lie, the more accurately we can tailor this information to your needs. This can be a most valuable resource for cost-cutting in your company's procurement activities.   
  
**Customer Feedback**

Your feedback is an essential part of how we improve our service, bringing benefits to both you and us. You are welcome to stipulate, if you provide feedback to us in any form, that we do not hold information about what you say to us, in a database that links your comments to your identification details – i.e., once you have had your say, your comments can be made anonymous if you prefer.  
  
**Security Facts**

We make every effort to comply with the provisions of the UK Data Protection Acts of 1984 and 1998. We follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information that you have given us, to prevent unauthorised access. Our security procedures mean that we may request proof of identity before we are able to disclose sensitive information to you.

The Stockshifters auction site is a business to business site. Given proper proof both of the identity of the persons representing an organisation, and of their relevant position in the organisation, we undertake to disclose to any organisation the full details of any information we hold about any registrants or transactions undertaken on the organisation's behalf. For this reason, when entering information on behalf of an organisation, including information about yourself as an employee or representative of the organisation, you should be clearly aware that that information will be disclosed on demand to properly accredited representatives of that organisation.   
  
  
**Cookies**

Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies come in two forms: permanent cookies (which stay on your hard drive unless you delete them) and session cookies, which disappear at the end of the session in which you are communicating with our site. We use session cookies but not permanent cookies, in order to make the site work faster and to allow you to navigate around the site. You can disable all cookies by making the appropriate entries in your browser settings: our site will not work properly if you do this, however.  
  
**Disclosure to Third Parties**

Stockshifters does not sell, trade, or rent your information to others. We may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, and related site information to reputable surveys or Government departments, but these statistics will include no identifying information.

The only people to whom we disclose information, that you have given to us, are properly accredited members of your own organisation, as discussed above in the Summary and under Security Facts.   
  
  
**Your Consent**

In using the Stockshifters auction web site, you consent to the collection and use of the information you provide to us by Stockshifters, according to the policies set out above.  
  
**Changes to our Privacy Policy**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will not only change the policy but clearly state on this page what we have changed, with the date, so that you can see if your position is materially affected by the changes.
