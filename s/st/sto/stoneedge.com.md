Monsoon Commerce operates a website at [www.monsooncommerce.com](https://web.archive.org/) (the “ **Site** ”). This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Monsoon Commerce does not own or control or to people that Monsoon Commerce does not employ or manage. The collection and use of your information by third parties (such as on third party websites and services that are linked to, referenced, advertised, or otherwise made available to you through the Site) are governed by those parties’ own policies. Before using such third party services or transacting with other users, you should familiarize yourself with their policies and practices with respect to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information.

## How Monsoon Commerce shares and discloses your information

Monsoon Commerce is not in the business of selling your information, and we take your privacy very seriously. In the course of providing the Site to you and other users, we do make limited disclosures of your information to others for a variety of purposes.

  * Technical Site Providers: Monsoon Commerce works with third party service providers to provide website development, maintenance, and hosting, promotional email distribution, backup storage, as well as other services for us. In the course of performing services for Monsoon Commerce, these providers may have access to or process your personally identifiable information. Generally, these disclosures are made under terms comparable to this Policy, and the recipients are limited to using the information the purpose for which it was provided.
  * Aggregate Information: Monsoon Commerce may also provide aggregate, non-personally identifiable information and statistics about our users, customers, demographics, sales, traffic patterns, and other information related to the Site to third parties.



Except as specified above, Monsoon Commerce does not share your personal information with third parties unless you have consented to the disclosure or Monsoon Commerce believes the disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process, or to cooperate with law enforcement activities, (2) protect and defend our rights and property, (3) protect our customers or users from misuse or unauthorized use of the Monsoon Commerce Site, or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our customers or the public.

## How we protect your information

This Site has security measures in place to help reduce the risk of loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. When you place orders or access your account information, we use a secure sockets layer (SSL) protocol, which encrypts all information during transmission. All of the customer data we collect is similarly protected against unauthorized access. We also employ other physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of personally identifiable information in our control. Nevertheless, in spite of our efforts to prevent third parties from intercepting or accessing your information (whether stored on our servers or during transmission), we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or communications will always remain private.

## Our commitment to children’s privacy online

Monsoon Commerce is committed to protecting the safety and privacy of young people using the Internet. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.

As specified in the Terms, Monsoon Commerce may from time to time revise this Policy. If we do, we will post those changes on this page and indicate the new Policy’s effective date so that you are always aware of any changes.

## International customers

If you use the Site from countries outside the United States, please note that your personally identifiable information may be transferred to the United States as our Site is hosted on servers located in those countries. By using the Site, you consent to having your personally identifiable information transmitted to and processed in the United States.

## In the event of merger or sale

In the event that all or a portion of Monsoon Commerce or its assets are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, Monsoon Commerce reserves the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users in connection with such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In such a case, your information will still be subject to the terms of the Policy in place at the time of transfer.
