You acknowledge that some features of the Application may involve us providing through the Application recommendations or suggestions for goods, services or benefits that we offer.

We may use personal information for the purpose of marketing but only where such use complies with privacy legislation in effect in the relevant territory. We may, subject to legislative requirements, send occasional emails to you in relation to our current or future services. Any such emails will contain an unsubscribe link, enabling you to opt-out of these messages.

We take steps to regularly destroy data (being personal information and sensitive information) that does not need to be archived and to de-identify stored data where identification of a person is not reasonably required or necessary.

## **4\. Disclosure of Personal Information**

We will not sell your Personal Information to anyone. We share your Personal Information outside our organisation for limited purposes, such as to help us run our business and provide services. Those persons and business include:

  1. Organisations who carry out credit, fraud and other security checks;
  2. IT support providers; and
  3. Marketing businesses engaged by us to disseminate materials to which recipients have consented.



Some of the family version of the Application’s features enable Users to label or tag User posts and content in a way as to identify particular interests of a Child or features of a Child’s development or progress (for example, “Swimming” or “Learning to Read”). This information may be provided to a Child’s teacher (if an Authorised Viewer) as those terms are defined in our Terms of Use, to facilitate their understanding of the Child’s progress, development, interests etc.

We may also disclose your personal information to third parties outside our organisation:

  1. Where we have your express permission to do so or it can reasonably be inferred from the circumstances that you consent to the disclosure to the third parties;
  2. If Storypark or substantially all of its assets were acquired by a third party, in which case personal information which we hold may be one of the transferred assets (subject to the same constraints on use and disclosure as under this policy); and
  3. If we are under a duty or have a legal right to disclose or share personal information in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms and conditions or to protect our rights, property, or the safety of our personnel and users. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.



We limit the information we provide to third parties to the information they need to help us provide or facilitate the provision of goods and services and associated purposes. We deal with third parties that are required to meet the privacy standards required by law in handling your personal information, and use your personal information only for the purposes that we give it to them.

**Transborder data flows**

The vast majority of personal information we handle is stored and hosted in Australia.    **All personal information relating to children on Storypark is hosted in Australia.    ******

Storypark’s head office is located in New Zealand, so some limited information about adult individuals (including customers) is transferred and /or stored there.

Some limited personal information may be provided to companies located in the USA who offer software as a service products that process content for inclusion on the Application (for example, conversion of images and videos to make them suitable for viewing online/ through a web browser). Those third parties located overseas are not permitted to (and are contractually obligated to not) access or use the personal information provided except for those limited purposes. We only choose reputable service providers and have agreements with such third parties that prevent them from using or disclosing to others the Personal Information we share with them, other than as is necessary to assist us.

While the information resides outside of the territory where you reside, it may be accessible to the local courts, law enforcement and national security authorities in a foreign jurisdiction.
