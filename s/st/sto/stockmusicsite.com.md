  * **Agents.** We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, and processing credit card payments. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.   
 
  * **Special Offers**.  We may send you special offers from time to time, unless you choose to “opt-out” of receiving such offers.  In addition, we may also send you special offers from other companies.  Again, you may “opt-out”.  If we send you offers from other businesses, we do not share your personal information with them.  The offers come directly through us.  Please see the “opt-in/opt-out” selection at the end of this policy.

  * **Law Enforcement.    **If we receive a lawful court order to release account or other personal information then we will comply with the law.  We will also release information when necessary to protect the life, safety or property of others.
