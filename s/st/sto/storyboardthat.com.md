We will take reasonable steps to protect user privacy consistent with the guidelines set forth in this policy and with applicable U.S. laws. In this policy, “user” or “you” means any person using or otherwise benefiting from the Service or otherwise submitting personal information to Clever Prototypes via the Service. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE SERVICE.

### User Data:

The Service allows all users to create storyboards using data provided by Clever Prototypes and, optionally, data provided by users. All data uploaded by users is referred to in this Policy as “User Data.” 

### Web Tracking Information:

We, and our third party service providers, may use web tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and clear GIFs in order to operate the Service efficiently and to collect data related to usage of the Service.
