# Privacy Policy | Stockopedia

Stockopedia ('we' or 'us') is committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors; this policy sets out how we will treat your personal information. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact us via email (subscriptions @ stockopedia.co.uk).

## (1) Information collection

We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal data:

(a) information about your computer and about your visits to and use of this website (such as your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit and number of page views);

(b) information that you provide to us for the purpose of registering with us and maintaining your user profile (which may include your email address, name, location, personal details and/or images of you that you upload);

(c) information that you provide to us in the course of using our website services (including information contained in any media uploaded for publication on our website); and

(d) any other information that you choose to send to us.

## (2) Cookies

A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.

We may use both "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies on the website. The session cookies enable our website to keep track of you whilst you navigate the website. The persistent cookies will enable our website to recognise your computer when you visit our website.

Whilst session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser, persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.

Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. (For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking "Tools", "Internet Options", "Privacy", and selecting "Block all cookies" using the sliding selector.) This will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including ours.

In addition, we use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies. The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information. Google's privacy policy is available at: http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html.

## (3) Use of personal data

Personal data submitted on this website will be used for the purposes specified in this privacy policy or in relevant parts of the website.

We may use your personal information to:

(a) administer the website;

(b) improve your browsing experience by personalising the website;

(c) enable your use of the services available on the website, including the facility to submit content to the website;

(d) send you general commercial communications;

(e) send you site-related email notifications, for example related to site improvement, new features and site content, or premium offerings;

(f) send you email notifications of related third party offers which are targeted to Stockopedia's focus (i.e. no spam) but not where you have opted out via the email settings on your profile;

(g) deal with enquiries and complaints made by or about you relating to the website; and

(h) provide third parties with statistical information about our users but this information will not be used to identify any individual user.

You acknowledge that our website is a social networking website and, where you submit personal information for publication on our website (including as part of your profile) we will publish and otherwise use that information in accordance with the terms of the licence you grant to us. Similarly, user ratings and reviews concerning you, and details of the performance of your public funds, may be published on our website.

Where you specifically agree to this (for example, during the website registration process) we may use your personal information to send to you marketing communications which we think may be of interest to you about our business or the businesses of carefully-selected third parties by post, fax, email, SMS or similar technology.

Where you have provided us with credit card details in relation to a subscription service, we do not store these details nor do we share customer payment details with any 3rd parties other than our partners, Paypal and Recurly who we use for secure payments.

## (4) Other disclosures

In addition to the disclosures reasonably necessary for the purposes identified elsewhere in this privacy policy, we may disclose information about you:

(a) to the extent that we are required to do so by law;

(b) in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings (including proceedings contemplated by a third party, whether against us, you or another third party);

(c) in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (including providing information to others for the purposes of fraud prevention and reducing credit risk); and

(d) to the purchaser (or prospective purchaser) of any business or asset which we are (or are contemplating) selling.

## (5) International data transfers

Information that we collect may be stored and processed in and transferred between any of the countries in which we operate in order to enable us to use the information in accordance with this privacy policy.

If you are in the European Economic Area, information which you provide may be transferred to countries which do not have data protection laws equivalent to those in force in the European Economic Area.

In addition, any personal information that you publish on the website will be available via the internet around the world.

You expressly agree to such transfers of personal information.

## (6) Security of your personal data

We will take reasonable technical and organisational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information.

All personal information you provide will be stored on our secure servers, which incorporate both password and firewall protection. Please note that your username will be publicly visible but this can be a pseudonym.

If you choose to publish information about yourself in your public profile or in articles you choose to publish on the website (both optional), this information will, of course, be publicly available on the internet.

While all payment information is sent over a secure protocol, other data transmission over the internet is inherently insecure, and we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the internet.

You are responsible for keeping your password and user details confidential. We will not ask you for your password (except when you log in).

## (7) Policy amendments

We may update this privacy policy from time-to-time by posting a new version on our website, and you should check this page occasionally to ensure you are familiar with any changes.

## (8) Your rights

You may instruct us to provide you with any personal information we hold about you. Provision of such information may be subject to the payment of a fee (currently fixed at Â£10.00).

You may instruct us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes by email (to subscriptions @ stockopedia.co.uk) at any time.

## (9) Third party websites

The website contains links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of third party websites.

## (10) Updating information

Please let us know if the personal information which we hold about you needs to be corrected or updated.

## (11) Contact

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or our treatment of your personal data, please write to us by emailing subscriptions @ stockopedia.co.uk, calling us on 020 3286 4722, or by post to Stockopedia Ltd at Office B224, Macmillan House, Paddington, London, W2 1FT, UK.
