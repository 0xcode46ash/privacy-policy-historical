# Store Supply Warehouse Privacy Policy

Privacy Statement

Thank you for choosing Store Supply Warehouse--you source for retail store supplies, fixtures and displays.Â  Your privacy is very important to us. Store Supply Warehouse, LLC is the sole owner of all information collected on this site. We will never sell, share, or rent this information to others in any way. 

This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, this information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. The servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment and are password protected.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. Sensitive information is shared within the company on a need-to-know basis. 

Ordering - During the ordering process we request information from you. Here, you must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your order. If we have trouble processing your order, this contact information is what we will use to get in touch with you.

Cookies - A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. 

Log Files - We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
