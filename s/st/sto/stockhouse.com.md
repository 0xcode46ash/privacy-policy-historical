**Collection**

  * We collect personal information directly from you and will have sought your consent to do this.

Stockgroup Information Systems uses Double opt-in to ensure everyone who is added to our mailing lists confirms that they want to be on the list.

_In a single opt-in, people submit an e-mail address and ask (opt) for specific e-mails to be sent to them. The inherent issue with a single opt-in is that people might submit their name inadvertently, or someone may have submitted their name for them, against their wishes.  
Double opt-in is an enhanced permission that tackles these issues._

_With double opt-in, the submitted name is not immediately added to a mailing list. Instead, an e-mail is sent to the address, asking for confirmation that the e-mail address should indeed be added. If the recipient of the confirmation e-mail does nothing, the submitted address is taken off of any mailings. The name is only added to a distribution list if the recipient responds to the confirmation e-mail._
