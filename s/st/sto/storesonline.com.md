# StoresOnline - Privacy Policy

StoresOnline, Inc. (hereafter â€œStoresOnline) collects basic client information to make your support experience the very best on the Internet. We respect your privacy, and we assure you that we will maintain and use this information responsibly. 

**Browser Data Collection**  
StoresOnline gathers navigational information about where you go on our website. This information allows us to see which areas are most visited. This helps us improve the quality of visitors' online shopping experiences by recognizing and delivering more of the features, services and products our visitors prefer. Additional non-personally identifiable information (i.e. domain type, browser version, service provider and IP address) may be collected which will provide information regarding your use of our website (such as the time of your last visit to a page on our site).  


**Disclosure of Personal Information:**  
Any information you provide to us at this site when you establish or update an account, purchase credits online or request information (i.e. name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and credit card information), is maintained in private files on our secure web server and our internal systems. This information is used to enable StoresOnline to deliver services to you. To ensure compliance with federal law, StoresOnline does not maintain information provided by children under the age of 16.  


You should be aware that we may disclose specific information about you as required by law, or based on our good faith belief that it is necessary to comply with the law or is necessary to protect the users of our website, our customers or the public.  


StoresOnline does not sell, rent or trade your e-mail address to third parties. We may, however, use third parties to help us provide services to you, such as fulfilling orders, processing payments, monitoring site activity, conducting surveys, and administering e-mails. If personally identifiable information (i.e. name, address, e-mail address, telephone number) is provided to any of these third parties, we will require that such information be maintained by them in strictest confidence.  


**Use of Cookies:**  
StoresOnline uses a browser feature known as a cookie, which assigns a unique identification to your computer. Cookies also allow StoresOnline to make our sites more responsive to your needs, by delivering a better and more personalized experience to you. The cookies are typically stored on your computer's hard drive and are used by StoresOnline to help track your clicks as you go through the pages within a StoresOnline website. In addition, StoresOnline uses cookies to help keep track of support requests and to tell us whether you have previously visited a StoresOnline website. This allows registered users to avoid reentering information upon every new visit to our site.   


**Updating Personal Information:**  
We prefer to keep your personal information accurate and up-to-date. To do this, we provide you with the opportunity to update or modify your personal information including billing information by logging into your account.

None of the information contained on our forums, online social media accounts, or discussion boards is medical, legal, business, or other advice or opinion of StoresOnline. Any opinion expressed via this service is that of its author. Users are reminded that postings are automatic, instantaneous, and are not pre-reviewed. Additional facts and information on legal or other developments may affect the subjects discussed. Confidential information should not be discussed. StoresOnline assumes no responsibility for the content or consequences, direct or indirect, of communications by users.
