## Steller Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy governs the privacy of information Mombo Labs, Inc. ("Mombo") collects inside the Steller mobile application and Steller website (the "Service").  This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Mombo does not own or control. This policy includes examples of the types of information Mombo collects, and the kinds of parties with whom Mombo shares such information. These examples are illustrative and should not be considered a complete inventory of Mombo's information collection, use, and sharing practices.  By installing, using, or accessing the Service, you agree to this policy. If you do not agree to this policy, do not install, use, or access the Service. Mombo may update this policy from time to time and will post updates to this policy on this web page, including the policy's effective date.  By your use of the Service, you understand and consent to the collection and use of your data, the transfer of that data around the United States and other countries for storage, processing, and use by Mombo.

#### Information Collection and Use

Mombo collects a variety of information through general use of the Service that help us convey to users your identify, validate that identity, and help us to deliver a better experience for you in the Service.

#### Information Upon Registration

When creating an account on Steller, you do so by authenticating through a third-party service, such Twitter. By doing so, you link your Twitter account with the Steller application, and Steller collects and stores information from such service about your public identify that you have provided to Steller and have consented to share to us. Steller also asks for and stores an email you provide upon registration. We do so to be able to contact you and validate your identity if so needed.  As part of providing you the Service, we may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Service and your Steller account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving.

#### Content, Following, and other Public Information

Steller is a content sharing platform, so most of the information you provide us is information that you choose to be made public. This includes not only the content that you post and data provided with such content, such as when it was posted, but also the accounts you follow, the content that you like and other public interactions on the Services. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated.
