# Steve Madden - Privacy Policy

Steve Madden Ltd respects your privacy. Consistent with our commitment to providing you a satisfying and helpful shopping experience, we have found that collecting Personal Information (defined below) through www.SteveMadden.com (the "Site") and our Steve Madden stores (referred to in this Privacy Policy as the "Stores"), helps us better understand the products and services most helpful to you. Our Privacy Policy describes the types of information we gather online and in our Stores and how we use this information. Please read this information carefully.

By accessing the Site and shopping in our Stores, you agree to be bound by the Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Accordingly, you should check the date of this Policy (which appears at the bottom of this page) and review any changes since the last version. If at any time you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use this Site and refrain from purchasing from us.

Our products are also available for sale in Steve Madden shops within many department stores. Data collected in these stores is the property of the department stores and is not provided to Steve Madden Ltd. If you have questions about department store privacy policies, please contact the applicable department store.

Use of Information Collected by Us

Steve Madden may collect two types of information about users: "Personal Information" (such as name, email address, mailing address, phone number, credit card number and the items you purchase) and "Aggregate Information" (such as information about how many users log on to our Site on a daily basis or frequency of customer visits to Steve Madden Stores).

We use customer information in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products, services, promotions and contests. We may also use this information to make offers to you, to help us target specific products and services to you, and to help us develop and improve our Site and Stores and tailor our Sites and Stores to your interests.

Personal Information Collected Online by SteveMadden.com and at Our Stores

Personal Information is collected online by us or our service providers on our behalf when users voluntarily register with SteveMadden.com to purchase items, receive electronic newsletters, use community and communication services, answer surveys and enter contests and other promotional opportunities provided on SteveMadden.com, when users make a purchase, and when users utilize the "Email to a Friend" feature. We also maintain a record of your product interests and purchases online. We may receive personal usage and demographic information from our Stores and from third parties we work with. 

In our Stores, Personal Information is collected from you in a number of ways, including the following:

    * When you purchase products from our Stores, we may collect your name, address, email address, telephone number(s) and credit card information (with the expiration date). In addition, we collect transaction information related to your purchase (such as what you bought, the price you paid, the payment method you used and if the product was on sale).  
    * When you fill out any in-store promotional surveys, we may gather certain Personal Information, such as your opinions on specific products and/or services, in addition to identifying information, such as your name, address, telephone number(s), email address(es), income and employment status.

Aggregate Information Collected Online by SteveMadden.com and at Our Stores

Aggregate Information is non-personally identifiable/anonymous information about you, such as age, gender, types of products purchased, frequency of Store visits, Site pages you access most frequently or search terms you enter. Aggregate Information is used in a collective manner, and no single person can be identified by that compiled information. For example, the number of people who shopped at SteveMadden.com during a specific time period or the number of people who shopped at our Stores who are 25 years of age is Aggregate Information that does not personally identify a specific user. Both SteveMadden.com and our Stores collect Aggregate Information.

Order-related and Promotional email

You agree that SteveMadden.com is authorized to transmit email to you for the purpose of informing you about your particular transaction.

In addition, SteveMadden.com and its affiliates may offer electronic newsletters and promotional emails to those who have agreed to receive emails during registration or directly from our email sign-up form. Unsubscribe and opt down instructions are included in each promotional email.

Sharing Information with Third Parties

SteveMadden.com does not share, sell or trade with third parties your Personal Information gathered online, such as email addresses, Personal Information collected as part of an online survey or other specific details about you, except with your consent or as described in this Privacy Policy. SteveMadden.com does not contribute to or participate in cooperative databases, which give other companies access to such Personal Information.

The Personal Information and Aggregate Information collected at our Stores may be shared with SteveMadden.com as well as reputable third-party organizations to contact consumers for marketing and promotional purposes. Third party contacts to our customers may be initiated only by postal mail. Except as described in this Privacy Policy, our Stores will not share your telephone number or e-mail address. In addition, in the event that you apply for a credit card account, our Stores may share the Personal Information we have collected with credit card companies and credit agencies.

SteveMadden.com, and our Stores may divulge Personal Information if such action is required for Steve Madden or any of our service providers or consultants to comply with any valid legal process, such as a subpoena, search warrant, statute or court order, or any valid administrative request from a law enforcement agency. In addition, we may divulge Personal Information if we or any of our service providers or consultants believes that such disclosure is necessary to address any unlawful acts or acts that may endanger the health or safety of another customer or of the general public.

Service Providers

We may share Personal Information and Aggregate Information with our service providers, consultants and affiliates for our internal business purposes.

For example, we use the services of Google, Inc (www.google.com) to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our Site. The type of information we collect includes products viewed and/or purchased, your location (state/zip code if you placed an order) and the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Web. The computers, which deliver the Web pages to you, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from our Site, our servers log your IP address. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. 

We also share with Experian CheetahMail (www.cheetahmail.com) usage information about visitors to our Site who have received a targeted promotional campaign with CheetahMail for the purpose of targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics.

Security and SSL

Protecting your order information is a priority for us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower right-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active and the server is secure. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the Site address will change from "http" to "https." Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers. In that case, you won't be able to connect to the server and therefore won't be able to place an order through a secure connection. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, please print our shopping page and place your order by phone at (888) 762-3336.
