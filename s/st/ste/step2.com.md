**On-Line Privacy Policy**

You'd be hard pressed to find a company that values your personal privacy more than The Step2 Company does. Here is how we handle the information we obtain from you when you visit one of our websites. 

_Personal Information About You_

When you send us personal information such as your email address, street address, age, etc., we use this information for limited and specific purposes including the following. 

> 1\. We use this data, in aggregate only, to analyze purchase trends and the reasons that people buy or use our products. We use this information to aid us in developing new products and making adjustments to current products.

> 2\. We add your name and address to our Consumer Service Mailing List for occasional mailings of Step2 literature. We also add your email address to our email address list, which may be used in the future for sending similar information via email.

> 3\. If you are registering a Sidewalk CruisersTM battery-operated vehicle, we will log the requested information in a database which will be used in the unlikely event that we need to contact you regarding the care or use of the product you registered. 

_Special Notice for Parents: Personal Information About Your Child_

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information directly from children, and we do not knowingly place children on our mailing list. 

The only time we request information about your child is when you register a Sidewalk CruisersTM battery-operated vehicle. This information is used, in aggregate only, solely for the purpose of analyzing trends that help us develop new products or make adjustments to existing products. _Under no circumstances is this information used to knowingly market directly to your child or contact your child._

_Third Parties_

**We DO NOT disclose any _personally identifiable_ information about you or your child to any third parties.** An exception to this would come in the event that we believe in good faith that we are required to disclose such information by a court of law. Additionally, information _in aggregate_ (i.e., not personally identifiable) such as the average age of children that use a particular product may be used to persuade retailers to carry a product. 

_Non-Personal Information_

When you visit our websites we detect and may record how you got here and where you came from. Specifically, we may collect the domain name or IP address of the site from which you connected, the type of browser you used, and what search terms you used if you found our site(s) via a search engine or index. This information is not personally identifiable to you. This information is used in aggregate to determine how and when people are visiting our websites. We also use this data, in aggregate only, to persuade retailers to carry our products.
