This Privacy Policy applies to any portion of the Stella & Dot website, including the official corporate website, Stylist personal websites and the Stylist-only portion of the website, known as the "Stylist Lounge" all collectively referred to as "Website." Stella & Dot respects the privacy of our Stylists, customers and those who visit our websites and this Privacy Policy is incorporated into our Terms of Use.

### Customer PII

To purchase Stella & Dot products, customers either fill out and sign a Customer Oder Form at a Trunk Show or provide their information on-line via the Website. The PII provided will be entered into the Stella & Dot Website by your Stylist so we may process your order. All Stylists must abide by this Privacy Policy and must not share confidential information except in connection with their Stella & Dot business. Individuals interested in learning about being a stylist or hostess will provide PII either on-line, via email or directly to a Stella & Dot stylist.
