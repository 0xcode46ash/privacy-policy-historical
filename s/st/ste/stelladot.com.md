## Privacy Policy

**We Care About Your Privacy!**

We want you to be happy and comfortable shopping with us. We do not sell, rent or trade your personal information with anyone. Only with your approval or at your request will we forward on your information to a Stella & Dot Stylist.

There are only three reasons that we collect information about you: to process your orders, put you on our mailing list and to maintain your shopping account. The only third parties involved are our service providers and they do not share any information. Two examples of service providers are the bank that processes your credit card and the company that maintains our mailing list.

**Collected Information:** Personal information you provide to us while creating or updating an account* and at checkout (for example: name, address, telephone number, email address, billing address, shipping address and credit card information) is stored in private files on our secure web server. We also use cookies** to save product and purchase information from the pages you access or visit so that your shopping cart can be saved each time you visit.

*You can easily update your account information by logging on to stelladot.com and clicking "ACCOUNT" in the top navigation of the home page.

**Cookies are information that are automatically stored on your computer. Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information such as your name, address or any financial information. If you do not wish to have cookies on your system, you can set your browser preferences to disable them.
