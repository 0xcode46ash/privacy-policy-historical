**California Do Not Track Disclosure:**  
Since Do Not Track technology has not been fully standardized, we do not respond to Web browser 'do not track' signals at this time. We await the result of work by the policy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take. We do allow you to exercise choice regarding the collection of information by third parties about your online activities over time and across third-party Web sites or online services for online interest based advertising purposes by going to [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).

The Network Advertising Initiative offers useful information about internet advertising companies, including information about how to opt-out of interest-based advertising by their members. See 

[http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) for general information about the NAI and [http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) for the opt-out page. You may also visit [http://www.aboutads.info/consumers/](http://www.aboutads.info/consumers/) to learn about online behavioral advertising and how to opt-out from online behavioral ads served by some or all participating companies.

These opt-out mechanisms rely on cookies to remember your choices with respect to ad-serving on websites. If you delete your cookies, use another computer or device, or change browsers, you will need to repeat this process. In addition, opting out of interest-based ads will not opt you out of all ads, but rather only those ads that are personalized to your interests based on activities observed on websites not owned and operated by Stein Mart.
