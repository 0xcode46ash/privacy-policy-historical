StepForth Placement does not collect information about website visitors for the purpose of selling, sharing or otherwise distributing such information. 

StepForth Placement and its partner companies, [WeDoHosting](http://www.wedohosting.com/), [ITMetacreations](http://www.itmeta.ca/) and [Transitional Media](http://www.transitionalmedia.com/) respect the confidentiality of your personal information. Even so, all websites collect information about website visitors in one way or another. Here is what we do with the information we collect.

**WEBLOGS:**  
StepForth and its partner companies use information collected by our website hosts to gauge how website visitors use the websites we've created. We do this by comparing several pieces of data that do not carry any form of personal identification including IP numbers, national origin of visitors, number of pages visited and time spent on our website, preference of browser type used, top referring search engines, etcâ€¦. None of this information is used to connect a specific individual with a specific visit to our website. All information gained from our weblogs is the property of StepForth Placement and is NOT for sale, barter, lend, or any other method of transfer from our office.

**COOKIES:**  
StepForth Placement does not use cookies on any of its websites and therefore does not use cookies to collect information or inplant tracable files on your computer.

It remains a part of an active file at StepForth for a period of 90 days, at which time the file is deleted (unless the file becomes an active client).

**Telephone Contact:  
**StepForth retains records of all telephone converstations conducted by our staff. These records contain information identifing the person spoken to, the time and date of contact and the topic(s) of converstation. These notes are kept by individual staff members and, if the contact is temporary, the information is disposed of fairly quickly. If the contact becomes a long-term client, this information is integrated into their client folder.

**Client Folders:  
**StepForth compiles the following information in hard-copy client folders; contact names, telephone and fax numbers, business and billing address, contact email addresses, type of business, host server access (ftp) information, a record of all communications between StepForth and the client, and all documents, research, website position reports and other documents relating to the promtion of our client's websites. We have two types of client files, ACTIVE and ARCHIVED. Active client files are available to all office staff members. Archived client files are closed, bound and stored in a lockable filing cabinet for a period of two years. **** We do not share any client information with ANY other company.
