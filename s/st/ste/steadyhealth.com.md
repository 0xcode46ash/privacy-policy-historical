Your non-personally identifying demographic information is used to personalize your experience, allow other members to find you through a search, to compose your personal profile - which is associated with a pseudonymous identity you have created (username). Your contact information are available to other members only if you pre-set this options, otherwise our default setting will allow other users to see your contact information only, without demographic characteristics. Non-registered users (visitors) have ability to send you personal message but they are not able to see your contact information until they subscribe and become a valid SteadyHealth.com community member. In the event that you decide to buy one of our products or services, you will be asked for your financial information (like credit card number) which cannot be read by others when you initiate your order through a secured system. You will know you are in secure mode when the tiny padlock icon - located at the bottom of your browser - appears "locked". We are using EMETRIX for billing purposes. EMETRIX pledge that the information you enter will not be shared with any outside party without your expressed consent (does not include fraud cases) and that any emails you receive from EMETRIX will be related to your order.

###  WHAT SECURITY FEATURES DO YOU HAVE? 

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). SSL is the leading security protocol on the Internet, it ensures that information being transferred over the network is private through a process called encryption. Once encrypted the information is an unintelligible code until it is decoded upon arrival at the authorized destination. 

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
