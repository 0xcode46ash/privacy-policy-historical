**A Note About Freedom** StickerGiant was founded in 2000 by an unknown mad scientist named John Fischer and world renowned illustrator [Mike Brooks](http://www.illustrationshack.com/). Since then John has made sure that StickerGiant works to source and sell ALL stickers that represent a myriad of views, Freedom of Expression through Stickers is our motto. Remember, Diversity is what makes America Great!

In case you are wondering, the staff of StickerGiant consists of Liberals, Conservatives, Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and Atheist. We are a slice of the American pulse and we like it that way. So, stand up for who you are and pick out a sticker that represents who you are. Say it with stickers !

P.S. we also dig the 1st amendment.
