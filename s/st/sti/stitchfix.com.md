# Stitch Fix | Privacy Policy | We Ship Boxes of Handpicked Women's Clothes

Stitch Fix is committed to protecting and ensuring your privacy. This notice describes our privacy policy, and by visiting stitchfix.com you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

## Information You Give Us

Our goal is to provide you with a safe and enjoyable experience. When we collect information about you it is in an effort to make our products and services more efficient and customized to you. You are free to browse the Stitch Fix site without revealing any personal information about yourself. However, once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. 

## Automatic Information

We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on our site. We use this information to analyze our users' behavior, interests, and demographics to better understand and serve our customers. This information may include the URL that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using and your IP address. 

## What about Cookies?

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a web site will store on your computer's hard drive. Stitch Fix will use cookies to identify you during your session, make our service easier to use and to store information in your account between visits. Cookies are never used to store sensitive customer information such as names, addresses, credit card numbers or passwords. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can configure your browser to prevent that. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing add-on settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. 

## Personally Identifiable Information

This is information that you provide to us that is specific to you. We collect information such as your name, phone number, billing information, shipping information and other personal information as indicated on the forms throughout our site. You provide such information when you schedule or purchase a Fix, enter a contest or sweepstakes, fill out a survey or form, provide feedback, etc. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You can always choose not to provide information, but you may not be able to use a particular service or feature by omitting the information. 

## Use of your information

We do not sell or share information about our customers, except in the specific cases described here:

## _Third-Party Service Providers:_

We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, developing systems, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 

## _Business Transfers:_

As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless the customer consents otherwise). In the event that Stitch Fix or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets. 

## How We Protect Your Information

We are committed to protecting the information we receive from you. We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our system. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures we have implemented reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. 

The Site encrypts your credit card number and other personal information using secure socket layer (SSL) technology to provide for the secure transmission of the information from your PC to our servers. In addition, only those employees and third parties who need access to you information in order to perform their duties are allowed such access. 

## Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information and Preferences 

If you are a registered user, you may access and update your registration information and your preferences to receive email or other communications from us by sending an email to [hello@stitchfix.com.](mailto:hello@stitchfix.com "Email Stitchfix")

You may also update or change your personal information or preferences by sending email to [hello@stitchfix.com](mailto:hello@stitchfix.com "Email Stitch Fix"). We will take commercially reasonable steps to implement your opt-out requests promptly, but you may still receive communications from us for up to ten business days as we process your request. While we make efforts to accommodate requests to restrict our use of your information, we reserve the right to delete all or any portion of customer information if we are not able to reasonably accommodate a requested restriction. 

## Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions

If you choose to visit Stitch Fix, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice including limitations on damages, disputes, and choice of law. If you have any concern about privacy at Stitch Fix, please email [hello@stitchfix.com](mailto:hello@stitchfix.com "Email Stitch Fix") and we will work to address it. 

Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice will change also. You should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.
