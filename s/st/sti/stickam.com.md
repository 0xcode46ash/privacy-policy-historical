**STICKAM™ PRIVACY POLICY**

**1\. Introduction**

**1.1 Purpose of Policy**

Advanced Video Communications, Inc. ("AVC," "us" or "we") is committed to respecting the privacy rights of its members, visitors, and other users (collectively, "members," "you" or “users”) of its Services. We have established this Privacy Policy to explain how AVC collects Personal Information and how AVC discloses that Personal Information as defined below. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Terms of Service. Both the Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service govern your use of the Services. 

**1.2 About the Service**

This Privacy Policy applies to all products, services and software provided by Stickam [www.stickam.com], PayPerLive [www.payperlive.com], and StreamAPI [streamapi.com] (the “Services”). In its operation of the Services, AVC collects, uses and retains all information, including Personal Information and Non-Personal Information (defined below) that you disclose in your registration to and use of the Services. 

**1.3 Notice Concerning Children**

**PLEASE NOTE:** The Services and any products or services provided therein are limited to audiences fourteen (14) years old or older. AVC does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from anyone under the age of 13, nor does AVC direct any content specifically at children under the age of 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a user is underage, we will promptly delete any Personal Information in that user’s account(s). 

**2\. Information Collection Practices**

**2.1 Types of Information Collected**

AVC collects the following types of information about users:

(a) Non-Personal Information. When you use the Services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs automatically track and collect the following categories of information when you visit our websites: 1. IP Addresses; 2. domain servers; 3. types of computers accessing the website; and 4. types of web browsers used to access the website (collectively "Traffic Data"). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you but is helpful for marketing purposes or for improving your experience with our Services. We also use "cookies" (defined in Section 2.3 below) in order to customize content specific to your interests, to ensure that you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the site, and to restrict the access of users who have violated our Terms of Service. Additionally our advertisers may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about people who view or interact with their advertisements on our site. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and judge their effectiveness. We do not provide any personal information about you to these third parties. 

(b) Personal Information. In order for you to access certain services, you are required to provide certain information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information"). Personal Information includes the following categories of information: 1. Contact Data (such as your name, and e-mail address); 2. Demographic Data (such as your gender, age, occupation, location, and martial status); and 3. Profile Data (such as your user name(s), interests, and Content uploaded by you, such as photographs, video and audio files, which may also contain your personal information and likeness). Additionally, if you communicate with us by e-mail, use any of the communication tools such as instant messaging, and video chat, or post messages to any chat groups, bulletin boards, or forums, or otherwise complete online forms, surveys, or contest entries, any information provided in such communication may be collected as Personal Information. We also may receive information about you from third parties (such as address information, purchase history and additional demographic information). 

**2.2 Use and Sharing of Information**

(a) AVC uses your Personal Information internally in order to promote and operate the Services and to introduce users to new features, areas or content. For example, we may use your Demographic and Profile Data to customize and tailor your experience by displaying advertisements and content that we think you might be interested in and according to your preferences. In addition, we may use Contact Data to send you information about our Company or our products or services, or family-friendly promotional material from some of our partners, affiliates, or to contact you when necessary. 

(b) Sharing of Non-Personal Information with Third Parties. We may share aggregate Traffic Data with third parties who assist us in understanding the needs of our users, and to continually improve the Stickam Platform and related services for them. We share Demographic Data with advertisers and other third parties only on an aggregate (i.e., non-personally-identifiable) basis. 

(c) Sharing of Personal Information with Third Parties. We share Contact Data with PayPerLive merchants with whom you have transacted business with. We also share Contact Data with our contractors who assist us by performing core services (such as hosting, data storage and security) related to our operation of the Stickam. Those affiliate companies and contractors have all agreed to uphold the same standards of security and confidentiality that we have promised to you in this Privacy Policy, and they will only use your Contact Data and other Personal Information as necessary to carry out their specific contractual obligations to AVC. 

(d) Sharing of Personal and Non-Personal Information with PayPerLive Community Creators. When you register to become a member of a PayPerLive community, you are providing Personal Information to AVC as well as to the particular creator of that community (“Community Creator”). Some communities allow you to sign up with your Stickam user name and password. If you use your Stickam user name and password to register for a PayPerLive community, the Personal Information and Non-Personal Information associated with your Stickam account will be provided to the Community Creator. 

(e) Display of Personal Information. Any Personal Information (including video content) that you post or otherwise disclose on or through the Services (for example, on message boards or chat rooms, streamed live via your media player, or within your personal profile page) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. Your account name and other profile information (but not your email address) is displayed to other internet users when you submit content or send messages on or through the Services, and you can be contacted by other users who send you comments. Any content that you submit on or through the Services (including any Personal Information contained therein) may be distributed through the internet and other media. Additionally, certain Personal Information from your Stickam profile will be pre-populated into your profile for PayPerLive communities you join using your Stickam user name and password. 

(f) E-mail Invitations. Some of the Services allow users to invite friends to join a service or a PayPerLive community by sending invitations via an automated invitation system. AVC stores the email addresses that users provide so that the respondents may be added to the users’ friend’s list. Recipients of invitations from a user may contact AVC to request the removal of their information from our database. 

(g) Other Uses of Traffic Data and Personal Information. We may provide Traffic Data and Personal Information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, and we reserve the right to cooperate with law enforcement investigations by providing Traffic Data and Personal Information to law enforcement officials without requiring a subpoena or court order in certain situations (for example, in case of threats to our Members).
