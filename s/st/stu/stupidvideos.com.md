### STUPIDVIDEOS PRIVACY POLICY

General
    StupidVideos collects personal information when you register with or subscribe to StupidVideos, when you use StupidVideos services, when you visit StupidVideos pages or the pages of certain StupidVideos partners, and when you enter promotions or sweepstakes. StupidVideos may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. 

When you register we may ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. Once you register with StupidVideos and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. 

StupidVideos collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners. 

StupidVideos automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, StupidVideos cookie information, and the pages or videos you request. 

StupidVideos uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.

Information Sharing and Disclosure
     StupidVideos does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: 

  * We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with StupidVideos under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help StupidVideos communicate with you about offers from StupidVideos and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;
  * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of StupidVideos's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
  * We transfer information about you if StupidVideos is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, StupidVideos will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy

StupidVideos displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area. 
  * StupidVideos does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.
  * StupidVideos advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies).

StupidVideos works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in different industries and categories of business. 
Cookies
    StupidVideos may set and access StupidVideos cookies on your computer. 

StupidVideos lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to StupidVideos's cookies. 

StupidVideos may use web beacons to access StupidVideos cookies inside and outside our network of web sites and in connection with StupidVideos products and services.

Confidentiality and Security
    We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. 

We have physical and procedural safeguards to protect personal information about you. 

Changes to this Privacy Policy
    StupidVideos may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your StupidVideos account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
    Effective Date: November 1, 2005
