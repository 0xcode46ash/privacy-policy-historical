Personal Information

We collect Personal Information that you voluntarily provide to us through electronic mail, electronic Web site forms, and other electronic means.  “Personal Information” means information that can specifically identify a person, such as your name, phone number, address, email address, date of birth, income, account number, driver’s license number, and social security number. 

Our Web server automatically collects information that includes, without limitation, information about your Internet service provider, the Web sites from which you connect to our Web sites, the browser you use, and the pages that you access on our site (“Web Site Use Information”).  We compile and sort this information in order to develop group profiles of our Web site visitors, to assist with systems administration, and to resolve problems.

Use of Cookies

We use cookies to collect information.  A cookie is a computer file that your Web browser saves to your computer’s hard drive to store information about your use of this Web site.  Our collection of Web Site Use Information may involve the use of “session cookies.”  Session cookies are temporary and are deleted after you close your Web browser.  Session cookies do not collect personally identifying information from your computer.  Among other uses, session cookies allow us to deliver content specific to your interests and to improve Web site navigation. 

In some instances, we obtain authentication information by the use of “persistent” cookies.  We use persistent cookies for customer protection, as part of our authentication technology.  Persistent cookies assist us in verifying the identity of a customer who is attempting to log in to an account.

You may block the use of cookies by changing the settings on your Web browser or by using a software program that blocks cookies.  If you choose to block cookies, the Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers can instruct you how to configure your Web browser to accept cookies, not to accept new cookies, to notify you when you receive a new cookie, or to disable cookies altogether.  However, if you choose to block cookies, you may not be able to access some features of our Web site application.

**Use of Personal Information**

We use Personal Information for purposes that include, without limitation, processing loan applications, administering loan accounts, providing services to customers, providing Web site visitors or customers with information about our products, services and upcoming events, and complying with legal or regulatory requirements.

**Disclosing Personal Information**

We do not share Personal Information except as permitted by law.  We disclose Personal Information to our family of companies and other companies and individuals that we employ to perform functions on our behalf under confidentiality agreements.  They may perform functions including, but not limited to, analyzing data, supplying marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), fulfilling orders, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists and providing customer service.  We expect the companies we select as our business partners and service providers to honor our Customer Privacy Notice when they handle information about our customers.  We do not sell or rent our customer information to any outside company or organization.

We disclose account and other Personal Information as permitted by law when we believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with legal process or assist law enforcement authorities; enforce our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of our users or others.  This type of disclosure includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 

**Internal Marketing**

If you supply us with your electronic mail address, postal address and/or telephone number online, we may contact you or send you information about our new products, services, or upcoming events.

**Security**

We protect your Personal Information by maintaining administrative and technical safeguards that meet or exceed applicable law.  We train our employees in the proper handling of Personal Information.  When we use other companies to provide services for us, we require them to protect the confidentiality of any Personal Information they may receive.  We combine these technical safeguards with physical safeguards and employee policies to further protect your information.

**Children’s Privacy**

We do not knowingly collect, maintain or use personal information from our Web sites about children under age 13.  If we learn that we have collected information from a child under the age of 13, we will promptly take all reasonable steps to delete the information.
