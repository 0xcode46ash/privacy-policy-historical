# StudentDoctor Network - Privacy Policy

The Student Doctor Network has a strict privacy policy that we feel strongly about. Although our lawyers created a huge boilerplate policy (so they could charge us a higher fee), the core message is that we will never sell or distribute your personal information to organizations outside the Student Doctor Network.

The Student Doctor Network collects personal information from you (name, postal address, e-mail address, and other data) during registration for the Student Doctor Network service, from our use of "cookie" technology and IP-address logging as you use the service, during entry into a contest or sweepstakes, and from your participation in optional online surveys. We may exchange some of this information with business partners who offer co-branded services as part of the Student Doctor Network, such as Everyone.Net and others. The information you provide allows us to inform you about updates to the service. As part of the registration process, we give you the opportunity to decline to receive any mailings from the Student Doctor Network. From time to time, IP addresses may be displayed publicly in the Student Doctor Network forums.

The data we collect from cookies and IP addresses gives us demographic information about the entire Student Doctor Network audience, which we use to improve the Student Doctor Network service. We also share aggregate information -- not individual data \-- with our advertisers to help them better understand our services and to monitor the reach of their advertising on the service. The Student Doctor Network also may disclose or exchange with others information you have provided to us if we believe in good faith that the law requires us to do so or if it is necessary to protect the rights or property of the Student Doctor Network or our users.

Although your information is protected, some guests may want to opt-out from receiving cookies all together. Cookies can be easily blocked on your computer by simply un-checking the "accept cookies" option in your web browser. This can be found under the options menu on your Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Explorer browser software. We also offer the ability to selectively block cookies on our message board system. Under the user preferences section of the message board, you can choose the option to "not store your information on your computer." This removes the cookie feature from the message board. [Click here to opt-out and/or remove all cookies set by our message board system](http://www.studentdoctor.net/cgi-bin/ubbcgi/ubbmisc.cgi?action=setprefs).

The Student Doctor Network uses reasonable precautions to keep the information disclosed to us secure. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties which receive the information. The Student Doctor Network also links to a wide variety of other sites and contains advertisements of third parties. We are not responsible for their privacy policies or how they treat information about their users. 

The Student Doctor Network has advertisements served onto our site by Advertising.com. Please [click here](http://www.advertising.com/privacy/privacy.html) to view their privacy statement.

Users of the Student Doctor Network free mail service should be aware that Everyone.Net may also collect information about you and may exchange that information with other business partners to verify your identity and to give you access to their services. Please [click here](http://www.everyone.net/main/html/p_policy.html) to view their privacy statement.

If you have questions, you should direct them to the Student Doctor Network site privacy coordinator at [privacy@studentdoctor.net](mailto:privacy@studentdoctor.net) for clarification.
