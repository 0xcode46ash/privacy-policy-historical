# Privacy Statement

**Registration**

In order to use some sections of this Web site, you must first complete the registration form and create a user name and password. During registration you are required to give contact information (such as email address). We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest. 

You have the option to provide demographic information (such as age and gender) to us; we encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our site.

The Coastal Research Group is the sole owner of the information collected on The Student Doctor Network. The Student Doctor Network collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site.

**Orders**

If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). 

We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.

**Surveys or Contests**

From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). 

We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic, and to improve or personalize the site as appropriate.

We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company will be prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties.

**Tell-A-Friend**

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. The Student Doctor Network does not store this information.

**Uses of Information**

We use the personal information you supply us, including your registration data, to enhance our services; fulfill your requests for products, programs, or services; and personalize your experience. We also use other information obtained from user site traffic patterns to better provide you with a personalized experience. 

The Student Doctor Network uses the information described above to do, among other things, the following: 

  * Personalize and enhance the site and service such as providing you with information we believe will be of interest to you. 
  * Contact users for feedback regarding The Student Doctor Network via email surveys. 
  * We may also use the information we collect to develop summary reports for our advertisers. An example of a summary report might be "100,000 people clicked on this advertisement." We provide this information to assist our advertisers in determining how to promote their products. We do not tell our advertisers who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements.



The Coastal Research Group may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide personally identifiable information to appropriate governmental authorities. If requested by law enforcement or judicial authorities, we will provide this information upon receipt of the appropriate documentation. The Coastal Research Group may also provide information to law enforcement to protect its property and the health and safety of individuals as permitted by statute. 

Other companies that place advertising on our site may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising or content through the use of cookies (using the same techniques as described above). Due to the way the Internet technically operates, we cannot control this collection of information. As the consumer, you should contact these advertisers or content providers that place information on the Student Doctor Network directly if you have any questions about their use of the information they potentially collect. 

Information that you provide while using products such as SDN Forums and SDN Chat is available for all to see. Discretion should be used in entering Personally Identifiable Information within such forums, as it may be collected by third parties. The Coastal Research Group does not actively associate the message content entered by our users in SDN Forums, or SDN Chat with those users' registration information. Our server computers will retain this information, however; and it is potentially available for distribution to third parties - most obviously law-enforcement agencies acting under subpoena power, per the terms of this section of our Privacy Policy. We do not use this information to target any advertising to our users, nor is it ever willingly distributed to any third party, such as an advertiser, except if subpoenaed. 

**Communications from the Site**

SDN Forum Notices  
We will occasionally send you email messages from the SDN Forums. We only send information that you specifically request during registration at the SDN Forums. This includes, but is not limited to, Private Message notifications, subscribed thread notifications, system updates and birthday greetings. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications.

Newsletters  
SDN does not currently offer a newsletter. However, this may be an option in the future. If it does become available, it will be an opt-in newsletter only.

Service-related Announcements  
We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.

Customer Service  
Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email only.

**Profile**

We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third party sources to create a “profile” of your preferences. We do not tie your personally identifiable information, or your purchasing history, to information in the profile. 

We do not share your individual profile with other third parties. However, we may share information from your profile in aggregate form only.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)  
We share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our advertisers. This information does not identify individual users. This includes, but is not limited to, age, gender, education status. We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.

Personally identifiable information **  
** We DO NOT Share Personally Identifiable Information with Third Parties 

**Agents**  


We use an outside shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.

**Service Providers**

Other than Google (see below), we do not use other third parties on our site.

**Legal Disclaimer**

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site

**Choice/Opt-out**  


We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order form. 

If you no longer wish to receive communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us through our [contact form](https://web.archive.org/corporate/contact_us.asp).

You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.

**Log Files**

As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. 

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. 

We do link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to allow us to ban guests that repeatedly violate our terms of service and/or usage policies.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do link the information we store in cookies to personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.

Cookies are used to enhance your experience at the SDN Forums. We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as the SDN Forums, will be limited.

Some advertisers use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. See “Third Party Advertisers.” This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by this site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. See the “Third Party Advertisers” section.

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**

We employ, and/or our third party advertising partner, Google, may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. 

To learn more about Google's use of clear gifs, please go to [www.google.com](http://www.google.com/).

We may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out."

**Third Party Advertisers**

Some of the ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by Google, our advertising partner. We do not share Web site usage information about users with Google.

Google may use cookies and clear GIFs on this site, which allow it to recognize a user's cookie when a user visits this site. The information that Google collects and shares through this technology is not personally identifiable. 

For more information about our third-party advertiser, or to learn more about the choices available to you regarding this anonymous information, please click here: [www.google.com](http://www.google.com/).

**Links to Other Sites**

This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by The Coastal Research Group. Please be aware that we, The Coastal Research Group, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. 

We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. 

This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.

**Co-branded sites**

From time-to-time, The Student Doctor Network may co-brand content with other sites. SDN does not share any individual information with these other sites.

**Bulletin Boards/Chat Rooms**

If you use the SDN Forums or SDN chat room on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. However, use of information for these purposes is a violation of our [SDN Forums Usage Policies](http://forums.studentdoctor.net/faq.php?faq=vb_faq#faq_sdn_tos).

**Access to Personally Identifiable Information**

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by making the change on our member information page or by contacting us through our [contact form](https://web.archive.org/corporate/contact_us.asp).

**Security**

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us through our [contact form](https://web.archive.org/corporate/contact_us.asp).

**Business Transitions**

In the event The Coastal Research Group goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another nonprofit organization, or distribution of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

**Changes in this Privacy Statement**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
