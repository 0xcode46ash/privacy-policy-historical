**OUR PRIVACY POLICY**

Your privacy is very important to us. You do not have to register on any of our sites or login to use them. The only area that requires login is our chatrooms. You must be 13 or older to participate in our chatrooms, and if you are under 13, we would prefer that you not participate at all in any site on The Student Center Network. All Student Center Network sites are for college students, high school students, and teens. Our sites are not for people under 13. 

If you do register on our site, you will have a password. The Student Center Network will make every reasonable effort to protect your password. You are responsible for keeping your password confidential. Do not share it. If you share a computer with other people, make sure that when you leave, you are not signed on to your Student Center Network account and that you have exited your browser. 

Be careful about sharing personal information in public places. If you send personal information through email, or post it on a message board or in a chatroom, then other people can collect it and use it. You may end up getting email messages you do not want from people you do not know. 

When you register at The Student Center Network, we collect some information from you, such as your name, year of birth, and email address. We do not register people under 13. You can update your information at anytime by changing your registration or user record and sending an email to feedback@studentcenter.org 

We will not sell or give out any of your personal information without telling you and giving you an opportunity to refuse. 

We may release your personal information if required by law, or if we have cause to believe that it might stop someone from harming others. 

Companies other than The Student Center, Inc. may run some services on the site. They may run promotions as well, and they may collect personal information. Since they are separate companies, we are not responsible for how they handle that information. If you are concerned about how they may handle that information, check out their privacy policies. If you do not want your personal information collected, you may decide not to participate in the contest or promotion. 

This policy does not cover the information gathering of advertisers or companies that you can link to from The Student Center Network. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those advertisers or sites. If you are concerned about how these other sites may handle information you provide, check out their privacy policies. By using The Student Center, you may be automatically providing information to other sites. 

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
