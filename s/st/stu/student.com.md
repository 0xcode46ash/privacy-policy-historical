## Our Commitment To Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

## The Information We Collect at Registration

When you register at Student.com, Campushook.com or any other sites owned and operated by The Student Center, Inc., we collect some information from you, such as:

  * Your name;
  * Your date of birth/age;
  * Your e-mail address;
  * Your mailing address (optional);



You can update your information at anytime by changing your registration or user record on the Edit Account page.

You do not have to register on any of our sites or login to use them or view them, although certain areas do require registration for full access.

## Our Commitment To Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

If you do register on our site, you will have a password. While we make every reasonable effort to protect your password, you are responsible for keeping your password confidential. Do not share it. If you are on a shared computer or workstation, do not save your password and make sure to log out when you close the browser.

Be careful about sharing personal information in public places. If you send personal information through e-mail, post it on a message board or post it in a chatroom, then other people can collect it and user it. You may end up geting e-mail messages you do not want from people or companies you do not know.

We will not sell or give out any of your personal information without telling you and giving you an opportunity to refuse.

We may release your personal information if required by law or if we have cause to believe that it might stop someone from harming others.
