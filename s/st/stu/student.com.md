 **What information do we collect?**

We may collect information about you in a number of ways. Most of the personal data we collect about you will be personal data you provide to us, for example through a form on our Site, if you get in contact with us via email, or speak to us at an event. Typically the personal data we collect will be your name, email address, phone number and other information about how we can help out with your query. If you place a booking via our Site we will collect information such as your nationality, possibly your bank details/credit card details and information about your guarantor, date of birth, your preferences around where you want to live (e.g. whether you smoke and information to help us match you with a roommate). We will also keep a record of our conversations with you, whether by phone, skype, IM or in person.

When you make enquiries about accommodation, we may collect your name, email address, telephone number and instant messaging account details. We may also collect information regarding the city or property you are interested in as well as your course.

If you log in using social media depending on how you log in we may collect your profile name/user name, profile picture, email address and date of birth. The social media information you consent to share with us will be combined with the other information you provide to us or that we collect about you. We will also collect information about your comments, posts and 'likes' to allow us to administer our Site and improve the user experience.

We may also collect information about you as you use our Site, such as information about your browser, what areas of our Site you visit and what links you click on.

 **Cookies**

Our Site uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our Site. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our Site and also allows us to improve our Site. For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them see our Cookie policy.

 **How do we use information about you?**

Where you have contacted us with a particular query, or to make a booking, we will use your personal data to allow you to access your account, to help us respond to you with the relevant information and to complete your booking. In some instances, this may mean sharing your personal data with our service providers and suppliers or with third parties such as property landlords to make sure we can answer your query or provide you with the service requested.

All the personal data we collect about you is stored by us or our service providers on our behalf. We will use this information, as well as the other information we collect about you to improve the quality of our Site and help build a profile of you so we can get to know you better. Also, it helps us make sure we and certain third parties are sending you information about products, services and offers that will be of interest to you.

In some instances we will also pass your personal data onto third parties. For example, when you make a booking we will pass your personal data onto the landlord so that they can get in touch about your accommodation. We will also share your personal data with our other group companies so they can help provide you with the information and services you have requested.

We may use the personal data we collect about you on an anonymised basis to create statistics and anonymised information which we then share with third parties including ad networks, search engines and analytics providers.

We may disclose your personal data to third parties in the following circumstances:

In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.

If OSL or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.

If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, court or police request, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of OSL, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

 **International transfers**

In order to provide you with the products and services, we may need to store or transfer your personal data to countries outside the European Economic Area, some of which do not protect privacy rights as extensively as in the United Kingdom. In some instances your personal data will be transferred to our group companies based outside of the EEA to allow them to contact you about our products and services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.

 **Marketing**

As we have mentioned above, we and our third parties will use your personal data to send you emails, messages and texts about products, services and offers we think may be of interest to you.

If at any time after providing us with your personal data you no longer want to receive such marketing from us or third parties you can get in touch at dp@student.com.

We recommend that you check the privacy and security policies and procedures of each and every other website that you visit.

 **Security**

We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal data from unauthorized access and disclosure. When transmitting your personal information to a third party (such as a landlord) in order to complete a request made by you on our Site, we will use commercially reasonable means to secure your personal data.
