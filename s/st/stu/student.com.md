**PRIVACY POLICY**  
  
  
**Revised November 13, 2003**

Your privacy is very important to us. You do not have to register on any of our sites or login to use them. The only area that requires login is our chatrooms. You must be 13 or older to participate in our chatrooms, and if you are under 13, we would prefer that you not participate at all in any site on The Student Center Network. All Student Center Network sites are for college students, high school students, and teens. Our sites are not for people under 13. 

If you do register on our site, you will have a password. The Student Center Network will make every reasonable effort to protect your password. You are responsible for keeping your password confidential. Do not share it. If you share a computer with other people, make sure that when you leave, you are not signed on to your Student Center Network account and that you have exited your browser. 

Be careful about sharing personal information in public places. If you send personal information through email, or post it on a message board or in a chatroom, then other people can collect it and use it. You may end up getting email messages you do not want from people you do not know. 

When you register at The Student Center Network, we collect some information from you, such as your name, year of birth, and email address. We do not register people under 13. You can update your information at anytime by changing your registration or user record on the Edit Account page. 

We will not sell or give out any of your personal information without telling you and giving you an opportunity to refuse. 

We may release your personal information if required by law, or if we have cause to believe that it might stop someone from harming others. 

Companies other than The Student Center, Inc. may run some services on the site. They may run promotions as well, and they may collect personal information. Since they are separate companies, we are not responsible for how they handle that information. If you are concerned about how they may handle that information, check out their privacy policies. If you do not want your personal information collected, you may decide not to participate in the contest or promotion. 

This policy does not cover the information gathering of advertisers or companies that you can link to from The Student Center Network. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those advertisers or sites. If you are concerned about how these other sites may handle information you provide, check out their privacy policies. By using The Student Center, you may be automatically providing information to other sites. 

Under 13? Please read this  
The Student Center Network is a web community of sites for college students, high school students, and teens. It is not for people under 13. If you are under 13, we request that you come back and visit us when you are a teen! We do not register users under the age of 13 nor do we knowingly collect personally identifiable information from those under 13. If we receive credible information that a registered user is under 13, we will remove personally identifiable information and close the account. Third Party Advertising

Third Party Cookies  
In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party ad server, Gorilla Nation, Double Click or their affiliates, or individual advertisers may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.

Violating this policy could result in civil or criminal penalties. 

The Student Center is not responsible for the content that is placed on the website by its users. However, content placed on the site by users or by The Student Center at the request of a user, becomes the property of The Student Center.
