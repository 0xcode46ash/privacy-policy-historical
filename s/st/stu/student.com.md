**Student.Com Privacy Policy**  


Except in the limited circumstances stated below, Student.Com will never intentionally disclose individually identifying information about its members to any third party without that member's permission.

**Where do we gather information from you and what do we do with it?**

When you sign up to be a Student.Com Member, we ask you questions about yourself. A few of those questions are mandatory to receive a Student.Com Member Name. In order to enter Student.Com contests, you must answer more of the questions (for instance, we need to know your address so we can mail you a prize if you win one). In order to receive certain benefits of Student.Com membership, like free e-mail, you must answer some of the questions and give us permission to share that information with our partners like our free e-mail provider. The information is shared with our partners solely to provide you with the services that they offer. 

Additionally, we use this information you provide to tailor the site to you and provide a more comprehensive interactive experience. For example, when you tell us what school you go to, we show you links and content relevant to your school and where you are. 

We use cookies, which let us offer features like personals and discussions, where you can contribute to the site. We need a way to make sure that no one else can provide information and pretend to be you. Our cookie is just a small text file - shorter than this sentence \- that your browser sends to our server when it asks for a page on Student.Com. We only send you one cookie - a lot less than many other sites - but you may receive additional cookies from companies that advertise on Student.Com, a process that Student.Com has no control over. Keep in mind that because these anonymous cookies are not from Student.Com, those advertisers can't link them with any personal information you provide to Student.Com. 

We keep track of how Student.Com is accessed. When you request a page from our servers, we store that request and the time you made it, along with the cookie that we've assigned you and the IP address of the computer that made the request. (An IP address is a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet that other computers, like our servers, use to identify and send data to that computer.) We keep track of these requests in pretty much the same way that every commercial web site out there does. This access information helps us figure out what the most and least popular parts of the site are, so we can make more of the most popular things and less of the least popular things. It also helps us plan the site's growth, so we can make sure we have enough powerful computers to serve you pages speedily. 

Keep in mind that there are other places on Student.Com, such as discussions and chat, where you may have the opportunity to disclose personal information to other Members or, such as in Personalities, display information in a way that is publically accessible. While our Web Site Agreement forbids people from commercially using that information, you should be aware that it is publically accessible. 

**How else do we use the information?**

We send you periodic e-mail messages about what's happening at Student.Com. This e-mail is only sent to Members who specifically request it when they sign up or edit their [Member Profile](https://web.archive.org/feature/memberprofile), and you can opt in or out at any time. 

We present reports, in aggregate, to potential and current advertisers about what kinds of people will see or have seen their ads. For example, we might say something to an advertiser like "We could show your ad to 150,000 Phys Ed majors" or "Yesterday, 29,000 people clicked on your ad, and 10% of them go to school in California." Being able to provide this kind of information to advertisers lets us keep Student.Com completely free to you. Remember that without your consent, we never tell advertisers information that individually identifies you, such as your Student.Com Member Name or your e-mail address. 

We may, however, disclose information that individually identifies you to third parties when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other members or users of Student.Com, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may also disclose such information to third parties when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. 

**Can you opt out?**

Yes. When you sign up, or when you edit your [Member Profile](https://web.archive.org/feature/memberprofile), you can choose not to receive periodic e-mail messages from Student.Com. When you sign up, you can choose not to give us permission to share some of your information with our partners. You can also [put yourself on our No E-Mail list](https://web.archive.org/feature/noemail), which will prevent you from receiving e-mail from features where other members supply e-mail addresses, like our Reject-O-Matic. 

**Can you edit your personal information?**

Yes. The Student.Com [Member Profile Editor](https://web.archive.org/feature/memberprofile) lets you edit the personal information you've provided to us. 

**Can you deactivate your personal information?**

Yes. You can [write to the Student.Com webmaster](mailto:webmaster@student.com?subject=deactivate+me) to deactivate your account. This will prevent the account from being used on Student.Com. However, any messages you've posted to Student.Com Discussions will remain on the site. 

**Do we collect individually identifying information from children under the age of 13?**

Student.Com is not directed at individuals under thirteen years of age, and we do not intentionally collect any individually identifying information from such individuals.
