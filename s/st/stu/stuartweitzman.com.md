However, we may ask that you provide information, including personally identifiable information, at various times and locations on this Web Site. For example, if you decide to register as a Member, you will be asked to provide information such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, and telephone number. To protect your personal information, Members must also enter a password. Further, if you place an order on this Web Site, we will request information such as your delivery and billing address and credit card number and expiration date.

Examples include customer support specialists, Web hosting companies, fulfillment companies (e.g., companies that fill product orders or coordinate mailings), data analysis firms and email service providers. Such third parties may be provided with access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use such information for any other purpose.
