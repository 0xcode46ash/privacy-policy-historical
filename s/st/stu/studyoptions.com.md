Information we collect**

It is possible to use our website without providing any personal data. However, we may automatically collect certain information about you when you use our website, including by our use of “cookies” (see below), such as the IP address of your computer and the dates and times of your visits. 

In some areas of our website we may ask you for personal data, such as your name, address and e-mail details, that will enable us to make your site visit a more rewarding experience for you and/or to contact you after your visit. Examples of this might be where you complete an online form asking for a copy of a prospectus or to book a place on an seminar, where you ask for information about a job vacancy, or where you subscribe to an online newsletter. 

In some other areas of our website, where you can register as an online user, we may ask you for more detailed information about yourself. In order to provide these types of services, it may be necessary for us to collect and process additional personal data, such as information about your educational history. 

**How we may use this information**

Personal data which we collect about you via our website is held on and processed by computers situated at our offices. We will retain this data for a reasonable period or for as long as the law requires.

We will not disclose any of your personal data collected via our website to any third party, other than in circumstances set out in this privacy policy and/or where you have given us permission to do so, unless we are required to do so by law.

We may use personal data collected from you via our website to manage and monitor use of our website. Otherwise, we will only use this personal data for the purposes for which it was collected, unless you have given us permission to use it for other stated purposes.

Cookies enable us to recognise you (by a unique number allocated to you) when you return to our website and so to personalise your return by, for example, customising web pages based on which areas of the website were previously of interest to you. If you have previously provided us with personal data, then cookies may enable us automatically to fill in your name and other information when, for example, you complete an online form.

Cookies also enable us to compile anonymous, aggregated statistics which help us understand how our website is used and so how we may improve it. It is not possible for cookies to read personal information on your computer and/or to find out any personal information about you.
