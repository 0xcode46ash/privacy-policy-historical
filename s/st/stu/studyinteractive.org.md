****Privacy Policy****

This is the privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") for InterActive Pro Limited, part of the InterActive family of educational companies.

This Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal data received about you when you visit the Study InterActive website or otherwise. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, because by visiting or using this site or contracting with us, you agree to its terms. This Privacy Policy applies both to this site, and to the web sites of other InterActive companies.

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any important changes by posting a notice on all Privacy Policy links. If you see a notice of change, please check the Privacy Policy, because your continued use of the site after we post the change means you have agreed to the new terms.

****Collection of Your Personal Data****

We collect your personal data when you ask for information about our courses or study materials, when you submit your answers to our assessment quizzes, eligibility quiz or surveys, or when you enrol or are enrolled by your employer in one of our courses, whether online or at a study centre, or order study materials.

To process your enquiries and the eligibility quiz, we collect your name, email and postal addresses, daytime phone number, and, if applicable, company and type of business.

To process enrolment applications and orders, we ask for your name, email and postal addresses, daytime phone number, company name and address, training manager's name, mobile and home telephone numbers, date of birth, professional certification or registration information, previous educational and professional experience (including details of any referees) if any, and credit or debit card information.

We and other InterActive companies (and affiliated companies) may also use your postal and email addresses to send you information about academic programmes, further professional training, and other services or products similar to those you have enquired about or ordered from us. If you do not wish us to send you this additional information, you can let us know by following the opt-out instructions that we include in every email, or by sending us notice of your preferences through the mechanisms listed in the section below entitled Your Choices.

****Sharing Your Data****

We will need to use your data to perform our obligations and exercise our rights under agreements made with you and to inform you of important registration and programme details.

If you have enrolled in our courses through your employer, we will share your data and course attendance (whether at a study centre or online) and any assessment results with your employer.

If you enrol in our online course, we may share the login and password that we assigned to you with our partners who provide some of the learning components for the course. We will not share your personal identifying data with such partners.

Otherwise, we will share your personal data only with the service providers who help us run this InterActive site or fulfil your requests and with other InterActive group or associated companies to enable processing and administration of study material orders or to enable them to inform you about services and products which may be of interest to you. We may also need to disclose your personal data to third parties when we, in our sole discretion, believe it is necessary to comply with the law, to enforce our User Agreement or this Privacy Policy, or in connection with a sale or transfer of the InterActive business.

****Your Choices****

As mentioned above, we may use your email or postal address to send you information on obtaining or maintaining your professional qualification, or other services or products we or other InterActive companies (or associated companies) think might interest you. We also may share your data with other InterActive companies (or associated companies).
