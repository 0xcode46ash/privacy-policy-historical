Privacy Policy

_This Policy is effective 18 April 2013_

This Privacy Policy tells you about StubHub practices for the collection, use and disclosure of information we collect about you through our sites and services, including the website www.stubhub.co.uk. By using our sites and services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you consent to the processing of information about you as described here.

**Controlling parties  
**

When you use StubHub, you agree that StubHub Europe S.Ã€ r.l., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, L-2449 Luxembourg, as the data controller, may process your personal data to deliver services under the User Agreement and according to the principles laid down in this Privacy Policy.

**Binding Corporate Rules  
**

In addition to the privacy practices set out in this Privacy Policy, eBay Inc. the parent company of StubHub, has established a set of Corporate Rules (also referred to as Binding Corporate Rules), approved by a number of European Union Data Protection Authorities. These Corporate Rules are a commitment by eBay Inc. to adequately protect your personal information regardless of where the data resides, and depending upon your location, may provide additional privacy rights through your privacy regulator or a court. If you would like additional information regarding the Corporate Rules, contact us via the contact details below.

**Information we collect  
**   
_Information you give to us.  
_ When you register and buy or sell tickets, we ask you for the following information:

  * Name and physical delivery, contact and payment addresses
  * Email address and telephone number (including a mobile telephone number)
  * Payment card information
  * Email address and password



_Information we collect when you use our sites and services.  
_ We may collect information about the way you interact with our sites, services, content and advertising. This may include computer, browser and connection information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from our sites, ad data, device ID, location, machine ID, IP address and standard web log information. 

We may obtain information from or about you in other ways. For example, we may verify user information with a service provider or combine your information with information we collect from other companies. Also, you may send us correspondence, testimonials, photos, blogs, writings, customer satisfaction surveys or customer service communications. 

**How we use information**

Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, efficient and customised experience. We may use the information we collect to:

  * provide the services and customer support you request
  * resolve disputes, collect fees and troubleshoot problems
  * prevent, detect and investigate potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our User Agreement
  * customise, measure and improve our sites, services and advertising
  * tell you about our services and those of our corporate family, service updates, targeted marketing and promotional offers based on your communication preferences
  * compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties and
  * comply with applicable laws



**Registration and sharing through third-party services**

You may choose to provide us with access to certain personal information stored by third parties such as social media sites (such as by way of example only, and not limitation, Facebook and Twitter). The information we have access to varies by site and is controlled by your privacy settings on that site and your authorisation. By associating an account managed by a third party with your StubHub account and authorising StubHub to have access to this information, you agree that StubHub may collect, store and use this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

MyThings are our service providers who use cookies to help us deliver our advertising. We require these companies to use the information they collect only to provide us with these services under contract. You can block these cookies by adjusting your browsers privacy settings. Learn more about MyThings business practices and privacy policies, including how to decline participation in their programme here [http://www.mythings.com/optout.html](http://www.mythings.com/Optout.html)

**How we share information**

We share information between our buyers and sellers that allows them to complete a ticket sale, like name, delivery address and other information that might be included on the ticket. We may also disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements (for example, a court order) or in the good-faith belief that disclosure is legally required, enforce our policies, establish or exercise our legal rights or protect anyone's rights, property or safety. We may also share your personal information with:

  * Members of the eBay Inc. corporate family like eBay or PayPal, to provide joint content and services (like registration, transactions and customer support), to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to guide decisions about their products, services and communications. Members of our corporate family will use this information to send you marketing communications only if you've requested their services.
  * Service providers under contract who help with our business operations (such as payment processing, delivery services, ticket cancel and reissue, or bill collection).
  * Co-brand partners for certain sites, events or listings. When we identify a co-brand partner for a site, event or listing, you agree that we may share contact information and transaction data (excluding payment card numbers) with that partner. Information shared with a co-brand partner is subject to their privacy policy. We do not control the privacy policies of co-brand partners and we encourage you to review their privacy policies.
  * Marketing partners for certain sites, events or listings where you explicitly agree during checkout that you would like your information shared for their marketing purposes. We may share your contact information and transaction data (excluding payment card numbers) with the marketing partner identified in checkout. Information shared with a marketing partner is subject to their privacy policy. We do not control the privacy policies of marketing partners and we encourage you to review their privacy policies.
  * Other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information (or about whom you are otherwise explicitly notified and consent to when using a specific service).
  * Other business entities, should we plan to merge with, sell assets to, or be acquired by that business entity. Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information will be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice.



**Cookies and web beacons**

When you first use our Site and Services, StubHub may send a cookie to your computer that identifies you as a unique user. We may use session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to store your preferences, identify you and maintain your signed-in status and provide you with a more personal and interactive experience. You can set your browser to refuse cookies or delete persistent cookies by following your browser's help instructions. If you choose to disable cookies, some of our services may not work properly and you may not be able to buy and sell tickets. We may also use web beacons, which are typically small graphic objects or pixels that are embedded in a web page. These web beacons allow us or our provider(s) to check that a user has viewed a web page. For more information about how we or our providers use cookies and web beacons.

**Accessing and changing personal information**

You can access and change your account information in My Account. There, you can change your address, telephone number, email address, password, payment card information and privacy and communications preferences.

We may communicate with you at various times, with administrative emails, phone calls or SMS messages, about transactions and service announcements, customer service responses and promotional emails like special offers, newsletters and updates. You can choose to stop receiving promotional emails from us at any time simply by changing your preferences, unsubscribing on the website or using an email's unsubscribe function. You may not opt out of receiving administrative messages or customer service responses. However, you can use the unsubscribe feature in SMS messages to stop receiving such messages, even if administrative. If you have agreed to receive marketing communications through checkout with our partners, you must change your communication preferences with them directly.

If you choose to use our referral services, we ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a copy of the email. StubHub or our service providers store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. Your friend may contact us at customerservice@stubhub.co.uk to request that we remove this information from our database.

**Security**

Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorised access and disclosure. However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the site. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private. 

**Third parties**

Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are buyers or sellers on our sites or other sites throughout the internet (including the ones we link to), different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. StubHub does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.

**General  
**   
We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. All amended terms automatically take effect 30 days after they are initially posted. If our help pages do not answer the questions you may have related to this Privacy Policy, you can write to the data controller within the European Union: StubHub Europe S.Ã€ r.l. â€“ Privacy Policy Requests, 22-24 Boulevard Royal, L-2449 Luxembourg, or you may contact customerservice@stubhub.co.uk.

If you do not feel satisfied with our responses, you may always contact your local data protection authority, who should forward your question, or contact the Commission Nationale pour la Protection des DonnÃ‰es in Luxembourg.
