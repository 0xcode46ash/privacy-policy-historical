#### AMERICAN CAMPUS COMMUNITIES

Effective Date: November 2, 2015

This privacy policy governs the websites operated by American Campus Communities, Inc. and its affiliates, subsidiaries and related entities.

Privacy Policy  
Our goal is to provide you with an excellent customer experience. We will take reasonable measures to protect the privacy of our applicants, residents, prospective residents, and Website visitors. We collect personal information only for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances. This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you of the information we collect and the ways in which we will protect that information.

Information Submitted by Applicants  
In order for one of our properties to process a lease application, applicants must provide some personally identifiable information, including an applicant’s name, physical address, e-mail address, telephone number, social security number, and date of birth. This information will be used to identify and consider the applicant for residency, and to contact the resident and/or the resident’s guarantor. We may also request contact information from prospective residents who visit or call one of our properties. This information may be used to contact prospective residents, or to inform them of news or promotions. The information you submit to one of our properties may be accessed by the property, and by American Campus Communities and its affiliates in order to operate and manage the services, understand our residents and residents’ guarantors, and to develop new products and services. If American Campus Communities enters into a business transaction with another party that involves the sale, transfer, or merger of all or a part of our business or involves granting security over all or part of our business, American Campus Communities may disclose your personal information to the other party for the purposes of the business transaction. In addition, your personal information may also be disclosed to a credit bureau or investigative agency during the application process or to a collection agency or others in the event of contract default in order to collect a debt or to seek compensation. We will disclose your personal information without your consent in response to a subpoena, warrant or order of a judicial or governmental authority with jurisdiction. We may also disclose your personal information in response to a lawful request from law enforcement officials or other governmental authorities or if we have reasonable grounds to believe that the information is relevant to a breach of contract or laws or in other cases where we are permitted to by law in connection with protecting our legal rights or those of others. In matters involving a danger to personal or public safety, we may voluntarily provide information to appropriate government authorities. We also use and disclose non-personally identifiable, aggregate information to operate our website, understand user behavior, develop new products and services, and other purposes provided that those purposes do not permit you to be identified.

Service Providers and Storage of Information  
We use affiliates and third-party service providers to assist us in our business. These affiliates and third-party service providers collect information in connection with online payments, process payment transactions, facilitate communications, perform website analytics, and perform other services related to our business. Our affiliates may use your personal information for business planning purposes. Service providers are only permitted to use your information for their own purposes if that information is aggregated, statistical and de-identified, or if they have your consent. American Campus Communities and its affiliates and service providers may process and store personal information in the United States and other jurisdictions. Your personal information may be subject to the laws of those other jurisdictions.

E-commerce  
E-commerce information is encrypted and transmitted using industry standard encryption protocols. These transactions are processed by third parties and we are not responsible for their privacy practices.

Cookies  
Our websites may use cookies. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers’ systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. You can set your Internet browser to refuse to accept cookies, but by doing so certain services may not function properly. We may also use Local Shared Objects, sometimes called “flash cookies,” to store information relating to your use of our website on your computer’s hard drive.

We also use an analytics tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about visitors’ use of our Websites. Google Analytics uses various technologies, including cookies and other anonymous identifiers, to collect information regarding your use of our Websites and third-party sites. For more information on how Google Analytics collects and processes data, please visit <https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners>. If you would like to opt out of Google Analytics data collection and processing, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by navigating to <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout> and following the installation instructions.

Linked Sites  
Our websites may contain links to other sites for organizations that are not directly affiliated with American Campus Communities. Also, American Campus Communities may have a presence on one or more social-networking sites to which you may have access. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of these sites, and recommend that you review their privacy statements as they may differ from those of American Campus Communities.

Questions, Access and Complaints  
If you have questions about our privacy practices or you would like to obtain access to the personal information we have collected about you, or you have a complaint about a privacy matter, please write to our Privacy Officer at [privacy@americancampus.com](mailto:privacy@americancampus.com).

Security  
We are committed to online privacy and security. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect your non-public personal information both during transmission and once it is in our possession. While our security measures are intended to protect your non-public personal information, the complete security of any transmission over the public internet cannot be guaranteed. As a result, we do not warrant the security of any electronically stored information or information you transmit to us over the Internet.

Changes to this Privacy Policy  
By using our websites, you consent to our collection and use of information about you. We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will let you know by posting the updated policy on this page and updating the policy’s “Effective Date” above. By continuing to access or use our Websites or services after an update, you agree to be bound by the terms of the updated Privacy Policy.
