Privacy of Student Information Accessible Through our Web Sites
Student enrollment and degree information made available through this site is provided to us by individual
participating educational institutions, which designate the Clearinghouse as their authorized representative. The
Clearinghouse relies on the accuracy of the information supplied by the educational institution and cannot edit, modify
or delete any student degree or enrollment information. The institutions provide to us only what they determine to
be Directory Information under their published institutional policies and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
(FERPA). You can read more about FERPA at the Department of Education’s Web site (http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/
guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html). Identifying information of individuals who requested degree or enrollment information
about a student must be made available to that student.
      What if I do not want my information to be available?
      Individuals may opt-out of having even their limited individual Directory Information made available to others by
      contacting the registrar their educational institution and filing a “Directory Information Block” or “FERPA Block.”
      The institution will then notify the Clearinghouse to block the record.
      What if I feel my student information is incorrect?
      If a student or graduate feels there is an error on their student record available through this site, they must
      contact the institution’s registrar. Because enrollment and degree information is also used for compliance purposes
      and is restricted by contract with the educational institution, the Clearinghouse cannot modify these records. The
      institution will provide the Clearinghouse with modified records, if necessary.
Compliance with Other Laws Regarding Information Privacy
Security of the student data we house is a priority of the Clearinghouse. Although our systems are principally designed
to comply with the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and accepted best practices, we believe that our
practices comply with all applicable federal and state privacy laws. We reserve the right to change our privacy policies.
Below are some of the highlights of our program.
      • The Clearinghouse maintains a comprehensive information security program, including administrative, technical
           and physical safeguards. This policy is regularly reviewed and updated as appropriate. Our staff includes a
           Manager of Information Security who is charged with maintaining and administering this plan.
      • Our firewalls and other controls ensuring security from external threat are regularly tested by a third party.
      • Our employees undergo mandatory security training.
      • Our maintenance and use of data is limited and controlled by federal law.
      • We maintain secure authentication protocols and access limitations for external and internal users.
The Clearinghouse has in place an Identity Theft Prevention Program (“Program”) pursuant to the Federal Trade
Commission’s (“FTC”) Red Flags Rule, which implements Section 114 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions
Act of 2003. The role of the Clearinghouse in facilitating the exchange of education information does not directly fall
within the implementation of the above Act. However, because the parties which participate in the Clearinghouse may
be involved in matters within the jurisdiction of the Act, the Clearinghouse adopts its revised policy effective July 11,
2011 to facilitate compliance by its participants. You may view the entire policy at the end of this document.
Student information submitted by Clearinghouse participants to the Clearinghouse is proprietary data and may
only be used in conformance with the terms and conditions stated on this Web site. Individuals requesting student
information agree to our terms and conditions when making an inquiry. The Clearinghouse has instituted these terms
and conditions and other reasonable controls to ensure that the information we receive from participants will be
used only in conformance with our agreements with them and applicable law. These controls and our information
security program are designed to meet Federal Trade Commission Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for
Safeguarding Customer Information.
To the extent that a financial institution participant shares any of its customer information with the Clearinghouse,
the Clearinghouse recognizes that it is subject to the reuse and redisclosure limitations of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley
Act. To the extent such customer information duplicates student information or information from other sources, this
prohibition against redisclosure shall not extend to such duplicate information.
