Generally, EducationDynamics collects information in several ways. Some information is gathered if you fill out the form provided. This information includes, but is not limited to, your name, address, phone number, age, email address, and information concerning your educational interests. You may also choose to submit optional information, such as a password if you register. We often indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional.

We may also collect information that you post on our blogs, message boards, or forums. If you contact EducationDynamics, we may keep a record of that correspondence.

**What are "cookies" and how does EducationDynamics use them?**

Data collection devices, "cookies" (including without limitation "confirmation pixels" for crediting affiliate marketers and/or for other purposes) are used to store, and sometimes track, information about you. Generally, cookies help provide personalized services and promote trust and safety.

All pages on the Site where you are prompted to login or that are customizable may require that you accept cookies. Our cookies are only read by the server that placed them and are unable to execute any code or virus. More specifically, we may use cookies to:

  2. Allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session; 
  3. Measure your visiting patterns and education-related parameters in the aggregate.

  4. Determine your clickstream to the Site; 
  5. Better personalize the content that you and other users will see on the Site; 
  6. Collect IP addresses and log-in information for system administration;

**How does EducationDynamics use my information?**

If you use our site or if you post on our blogs, forums, message boards, or chat rooms, some personally identifiable information may be seen by other members or users. This includes, but is not limited to, the poster's name, date of post, comments, IP address, survey responses, and other information. This information may also be transferred to any outside entity, including the press or other media that visits our site. 

We use the information we automatically collect (such as contact information, IP address and basic browser and system details) to help us optimize our sites and the services we currently offer on the sites and may offer in the future.  We also collect personal information and share it with trusted third parties to analyze and provide us with feedback, suggestions and strategies to improve our business processes and the services we provide.  If you elect to provide us with personally identifiable information, such information may also be used for marketing purposes, and may result in follow-up communications from EducationDynamics, our affiliated properties and services, and institutions of higher education about opportunities, programs and other services that are related to education. In addition, from time to time, we may share personally identifiable information (such as e-mail addresses and other contact information such as name, email address and phone number) with carefully selected third parties, so they may offer goods and services that we believe may be of interest to our customers.

EducationDynamics shares your personal information with the educational institutions you selected and, if you use one of our matching services, those institutions which we have matched your profile so that these institutions may contact you with information about their programs. Use of your personal information by these educational institutions is not governed by this Privacy Policy.  For further information on such institution’s use of your information, please visit the applicable privacy policy of such institution.  Educational institutions have separate policy practices for which EducationDynamics has no responsibility or liability.    

If you submit information to an advertiser or other third party that is made available on or through EducationDynamics, the information obtained during your visit to that advertiser’s website, and the information you give to the advertiser will be governed by the advertiser’s privacy policy.  For further information on such advertiser’s use of your information, please visit the applicable privacy policy of such advertisers. Advertisers made available on this site have separate policy practices for which EducationDynamics has no responsibility or liability.

We may disclose account information where we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating EducationDynamics's policies as specified in the Privacy Policy or relevant User Agreement, may be violating state or federal law, or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) EducationDynamics's rights or property, other users of the Site, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. EducationDynamics may disclose or access account information when we believe that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain and improve our services.

We also may use your personal information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, respond to your inquiries, detect and protect against error, fraud, or other criminal activity, enforce our User Agreement, and for any other purposes that EducationDynamics deems appropriate.

We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Policy. For example, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they unlawfully collect from the Site. We will try to protect your privacy, however, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.

Spam. We do not tolerate spam. You are not licensed to add us or any user to your mail (email or physical mail) list without his or her affirmative consent. You are not licensed to use spam in promoting the Site.

**What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?**

Whenever EducationDynamics handles your personal information, we take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with the relevant User Agreement and this Policy. Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States. We use procedural and mechanical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy, including encryption. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We cannot, therefore, warrant or ensure the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

If you are a registered user of the Site, your registration/account information may be password protected so that only you have access to this personal information. We recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone. EducationDynamics will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or unsolicited email. If you choose to share your user name and password or your personal information with third parties, you are responsible for all actions taken with your account and therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.
