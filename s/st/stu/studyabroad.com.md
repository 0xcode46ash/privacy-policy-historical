If you use our Site or if you post on our blogs, forums, message boards, or chat rooms, some personally identifiable information may be seen by other members or users. This includes, but is not limited to, the poster's name, date of post, comments, IP address, survey responses, and other information. This information may also be transferred to any outside entity, including the press or other media.

Some of our employees and contractors are subject to non-disclosure agreements with us. These and other legal restrictions may prohibit their use of the information you provide us for any purpose except to facilitate the specific EducationDynamics-related operation, unless you explicitly agreed or gave your prior permission to them for additional uses.

If you complete a transaction with an advertiser linked to EducationDynamics, the information obtained during your visit to that advertiser, and the information you give, may be provided to the advertiser. Advertisers linked to the Site have separate policy practices for which EducationDynamics has no responsibility or liability.

We may disclose account information where we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating EducationDynamics's policies as specified in the Privacy Policy or relevant User Agreement, may be violating state or federal law, or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) EducationDynamics's rights or property, other users of the Site, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. EducationDynamics may disclose or access account information when we believe that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain and improve our services.

We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Policy. For example, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they unlawfully collect from the Site. We will try to protect your privacy, however, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.

**What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information?**

EducationDynamics will contact you (by email, phone, and/or mail) if you complete a contact form on the Site, if you register for a membership, or if you contact us directly by direct mail or email. We will also contact you regarding any problems with your account and for website misuse. We may also contact you regarding our services, such as new features regarding our websites or other education-related updates. We may also contact you about "special offers" from our partners. Also, we may contact you to check on the status of your enrollment or other education-related activities. Simply send us an email if you do not wish to receive optional communications.

**How may I use other users' information?**

Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with all applicable local laws and rules regarding online conduct and privacy, as well as content. Specifically, but not as a limitation, you agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding transmission of technical and personal data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside.

Spam. We do not tolerate spam. You are not licensed to add us or any user to your mail (email or physical mail) list without his or her affirmative consent. You are not licensed to use spam in promoting the Site.

**What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?**

Whenever EducationDynamics handles your personal information, we take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with the relevant User Agreement and this Policy. Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States. We use procedural and mechanical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy, including encryption. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We cannot, therefore, warrant or ensure the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

If you are a registered user of the Site, your registration/account information may be password protected so that only you have access to this personal information. We recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone. EducationDynamics will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or unsolicited email. If you choose to share your user name and password or your personal information with third parties, you are responsible for all actions taken with your account and therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.
