# Prom, Party, Birthday, Gifts, School Spirit Supplier ­ Stumps Since 1926 : Site Security and Privacy

### Site Security

At StumpsParty.com, your security is our number one concern. We are pleased to tell you about the measures we have taken to ensure your security. 

We have followed and surpassed all industry standards necessary for a secure site. We are a GeoTrust™ secure site. This means that all information sent to our site is encrypted and protected against disclosure to third parties. 

Our servers use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). This is an advanced technology that **encrypts all of the information you send us** (this includes all of your personal information such as your name, address, credit card number, etc.) so that it cannot be read as the information as it travels over the Internet. 

SSL works with Microsoft Internet Explorer (v. 3.0 and higher), Netscape Navigator (v. 2.0 and higher) and America Online (v. 3.0 and higher). 

To ensure that you are accessing our secure server to place your order, look at the bottom left-hand corner of your browser. You should see a closed lock or unbroken key icon (depending on your browser). If you see either of these icons, then SSL is active. 

#### Cookies

A "cookie" is a small text file that your browser keeps on your hard disk, and is very common on the Internet. They are a way for StumpsParty.com to remember who you are. They also allow us to "remember" what you put in your shopping bag as you browse through our product selection. However, you can still browse our products and use many of our site features without cookies. 

To place an order on StumpsParty.com, your browser does need to accept cookies. If you do not feel comfortable modifying your browser preference files, please feel free to e-mail us for assistance. 

To enable cookies in your browser.

  * For Internet Explorer Users: Choose TOOLS, then INTERNET OPTIONS, then SECURITY, then CUSTOM LEVEL, then scroll down to the COOKIES area and choose ENABLE. 
  * For Netscape Users: Choose EDIT, then PREFERENCES, then ADVANCED, then see COOKIES area and choose ACCEPT COOKIES. 



#### Fair Credit Billing Act

Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank or credit card company cannot hold you responsible for more than $50 of any unauthorized or fraudulent charges on your credit card. In the event of any unauthorized use of your credit card, you are required to notify your credit card provider in accordance with the agreement you have with them. 

Please rest assured that shopping on StumpsParty.com is safe and secure! You'll find the experience fun, easy and quick.

### Children's On-line Privacy Protection

In addition, in compliance with the Children's On-line Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we require parental consent on any information provided to us by children under the age of 13. We have provided links on our site to our privacy policy from all places where information can be gathered. 

We do not request any information from children under the age of 13, although we do gather information from the parents wishing to enroll their children in our ShindigZ Birthday Club. This information includes the names, ages, gender and birth dates of children registered by a parent. This information is used only to provide relevant information to the parent prior to their child's birthday. 

At no time is this information shared with third parties. Additionally, we do request e-mail consent from a parent if we receive any information from a child under 13.
