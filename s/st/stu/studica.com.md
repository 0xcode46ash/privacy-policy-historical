Studica.com has securely processed hundreds of thousands of credit card transactions since 2000. The latest security technology, including a SSL safe connection, has allowed Studica to be an industry leader with a secure online system.  SSL encrypts your credit card number and personal information before they travel over the Internet. This ensures your online shopping experience is safe and secure.

In order to protect our customer’s security, measures have been integrated to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We employ 128 bit SSL encryption with a signed Key from  **Network Solutions**.
