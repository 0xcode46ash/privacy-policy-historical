# Study London privacy policy - Study London

Study London is committed to protecting the privacy of those using our Site and the confidentiality of the personal information with which our users provide us on the Site. This privacy policy explains the steps we take to ensure information about you is kept secure and confidential.

Please read this privacy policy carefully, as once you use our website or our services you will be deemed to have read and accepted this privacy policy. You must not use our website or our services if you do not accept this privacy policy.

## Data Protection Act 1998

London & Partners Limited is the data controller of your data. We are registered under the Data Protection Act 1998, registration number  **Z2650570** , and comply with the Act in all our dealings with your personal data.

Your personal information is safe with us.

Links to third party sites appear on the Site. Those third party sites are not our responsibility, although we choose them with care. You should read and satisfy yourself with those third parties' privacy policies before using such linked sites.

Information on data protection is contained on the Information Commissioner's own web site at [www.dataprotection.gov.uk](http://www.ico.gov.uk/ "Link will open in a new window").

## The information we collect

We will only collect personal information about you and given by you when you register with us, or with a marketing partner and specifically request them to pass your details to us for registration purposes. We will always let you have a copy of all personal information we have about you should you request it. Contact [dataprotection@londonandpartners.com](mailto:dataprotection@londonandpartners.com) to do this.

You are able to update and amend your personal information at any time by emailing [dataprotection@londonandpartners.com](mailto:dataprotection@londonandpartners.com). You can also unsubscribe from [www.studylondon.ac.uk](http://www.studylondon.ac.uk/) at any time by following the unsubscribe link in our email communications

## Purposes for which we use information about our users

We collect information about our users for a variety of purposes. These include:

  * where you supply information to us in order that we deliver a required service e.g. newsletters relevant to you and your interests, information will be processed by us to supply the information and material which we promise. Your information is held at London & Partners in the UK, and maintained by London & Partners and yourself via [www.studylondon.ac.uk](http://www.studylondon.ac.uk/)

  * so we can communicate with you in response to a specific action performed by you on this site or one of our affiliate sites, e.g. when you contact a university, save a course, register for updates, enter a competition, or register for an event.

  * so we can inform you of London university news, competitions, special offers, relevant products and services which may be of interest

  * so we can send you news items which are relevant to your interests

  * to help us improve and personalise our services




## Passing on information about you

We will not pass on any information provided by you to any third parties unless you specifically consent. We may however disclose aggregate – but not individual – statistics to potential partners and advertisers, such as the number of users we have, their location, etc. We never pass on your email address to third parties except where you have granted us permission e.g. when you send an email enquiry to a university via [www.studylondon.ac.uk](http://www.studylondon.ac.uk/) then your email address and profile information is sent to your chosen university.

## Security

Keeping information about you secure is very important to us. However, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information which you send to us, and you do so at your own risk.

London & Partners will take precautions to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your user data under our control. Only authorised employees and subcontractors will be given access to the information you provide us. Our systems are designed to ensure that your data can only be viewed online if your email and password are correctly input. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur, we take many precautions aimed at preventing such occurrences.

You are ultimately responsible for the security of your email and password. Please take care when using and storing them. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. You should log out of your browser at the end of each computer session to ensure that others cannot access your personal information, especially if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or internet cafe.

##  **Cookies in Use on This Site**

Our cookies help us:

  * Make our website work as you'd expect
  * Save you having to login every time you visit the site
  * Remember your settings during and between visits
  * Offer you free services/content (thanks to advertising)
  * Improve the speed/security of the site
  * Allow you to share pages with social networks like Facebook
  * Continuously improve our website for you
  * Make our marketing more efficient



We do not use cookies to:

  * Collect any personally identifiable information (without your express permission)
  * Collect any sensitive information (without your express permission)
  * Pass personally identifiable data to third parties



You can learn more about all the cookies we use below

 **Granting us permission to use cookies**

If the settings on your software that you are using to view this website (your browser) are adjusted to accept cookies we take this, and your continued use of our website, to mean that you are fine with this. Should you wish to remove or not use cookies from our site you can learn how to do this below, however doing so will probably mean that our site will not work as you would expect.

 **Website Function Cookies**

 **Our own cookies**

We use cookies to make our website work including:

  * Determining if you are logged in or not
  * Remembering your course shortlist



There is no way to prevent these cookies being set other than to not use our site.

 **Third party functions**

Our site, like most websites, includes functionality provided by third parties. A common example is an embedded YouTube video. Our site includes the following which use cookies:

  * YouTube - powers the videos on our site
  * Google - we use their maps and translation tool



Disabling these cookies will probably break the functions offered by these third parties. You can read their [privacy policy here](http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/policies/privacy/).

 **Social Website Cookies**

So you can easily “Like” or share our content on the likes of Facebook and Twitter we have included sharing buttons on our site.

Cookies are set by: Google+, Twitter and Facebook

The privacy implications on this will vary from social network to social network and will be dependent on the privacy settings you have chosen on these networks.

 **Anonymous Visitor Statistics Cookies**

We use cookies to compile visitor statistics such as how many people have visited our website, what type of technology they are using (e.g. Mac or Windows which helps to identify when our site isn't working as it should for particular technologies), how long they spend on the site, what pages they look at etc. This helps us to continuously improve our website. These analytics programs also tell us if, on an anonymous basis, how people reached this site (e.g. from a search engine) and whether they have been here before helping us to put more money into developing our services for you instead of marketing spend.

We use: Google Analytics

You can read more about this [privacy policy too.](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html)

 **Advertising Cookies**

Cookies are widely used in online advertising. Neither us, advertisers or our advertising partners can gain personally identifiable information from these cookies. We aim only to serve relevant advertising to you on our site, and cookies help us to achieve this.

You can learn more about online advertising at [http://www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/). You can opt-out of almost all advertising. It is also worth noting that opting out of advertising cookies will not mean you won't see adverts, simply that they won't be tailored to you any longer.

We use:

  * DoubleClick - owned by Google
  * Weborama
  * Aimfair
  * Adtech



 **Banner Adverts**

We partly fund our site by showing adverts as you browse our site. These adverts are managed by a partner specialising in providing adverts for multiple sites. Invariably these partners place cookies to collect anonymous data about the websites you visit so they can personalise the adverts to you, ensure that you don't see the same adverts too frequently and ultimately report to advertisers on which adverts are working. Our partner is: Ad2One

 **Turning Cookies Off**

You can usually switch cookies off by adjusting your browser settings to stop it from accepting cookies (Learn how [here](http://www.aboutcookies.org/)). Doing so however will almost certainly limit the functionality of ours and a large proportion of the world's websites as cookies are a standard part of most modern websites

It may be that your concerns around cookies relate to so called "spyware". Rather than switching off cookies in your browser you may find that anti-spyware software achieves the same objective by automatically deleting cookies considered to be invasive. Learn more about [managing cookies with antispyware software](http://www.attacat.co.uk/resources/cookies/how-to-control-your-online-privacy).
