_Supplementing Information:_  
In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to protect all of its users, it is necessary for us to verify your credit card information with a third party. Currently we use Verisign, but we reserve the right to change verification agents if we deem it necessary. We collect credit card information for verification purposes only; we do not store your credit card information with your profile other than that your credit card has been verified.

_Co-Branded Partners:_  
Co-branded sites are sites that appear labeled with another company's logos or trademarks. As indicated herein, information collected on co-branded pages hosted by StubHub is collected by co-branded partners. The contact information and transaction data (excluding credit card numbers) provided by customers on our co-branded sites and registered or transacted through the partner's co-branded 'StubHub' are essentially shared by StubHub and the owner of that co-branded website. Your choices about being contacted are included with that information so that partner may respect your preferences. However, please understand StubHub does not control information actually owned by co-branded partners. Please refer to their respective privacy policies for information on how they will handle your information. All information provided by you will be used according to the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

**Profile**

We store information that we collect through cookies and log files to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to the users personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to our Web site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. This information may also be used to help improve our services overall. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. 

_Cookies:_  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is not linked to any personally identifiable information while a user is visiting our site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our site. By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, they may still browse our site, however they will not be able to buy or sell tickets. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.

StubHub is currently using and has contracted with Omniture, a third party, to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers. We use the information to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by Omniture on this site. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. StubHub owns this data and controls how it may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt-out" of this website analysis tool by clicking here <http://www.omniture.com/privacy#optout>.

_Log Files:_  
Like most standard Web site servers, we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring pages, platform type, date/time stamp. IP addresses, etc. are linked to personally identifiable information. We use Log Files in error diagnostics, session management and determining our advertising efficacy.

**Communications from the Site**

_Special Offers and Updates:_   
Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections. 

_Transactions:_  
Members who buy or sell tickets will receive a number of emails throughout the transaction process and they may sometimes receive phone calls from our Customer Service department to ensure smooth transactions. 

_Newsletter:_  
If a user wishes to subscribe to HubBub, our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. Out of respect for our users privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.

_Service Announcements:_  
On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.

_Customer Service:_  
We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services. We respond to issues relating to a user's account via email or phone, in accordance with the user's wishes. 

**Sharing Information**

At StubHub, we care about your privacy. We will not share your credit card number or any other financial information with any third party except for the verification purposes mentioned above. We may share your personal information with third parties in the following instances: 

_Legal Disclaimer:_  
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site. We may disclose personal information in order to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We also share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required by law.

_Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable):_  
We share some aggregated demographic information (age, zip codes) with some of our partners. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information. We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. 

_Co-Branded Partners:_  
The contact information and transaction data (excluding credit card numbers) provided by customers on our co-branded sites and registered or transacted through a partner's co-branded StubHub are essentially shared with the owner of that co-branded website. Your choices about being contacted are included with that information so that partner can respect your preferences. Refer to that website's privacy policy for information on how they will handle your information. 

_Third Party Service Providers:_  
We may disclose information about individual users to third parties who provide services to StubHub. These third parties provide a variety of services to StubHub, including, without limitation, fulfilling ticket orders via courier delivery, processing credit card transactions, and disbursing payments to sellers. In addition, these services may include enhancing the information StubHub collects about its customers. We may also use third-party email providers to assist with sending our marketing emails. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. Any personally identifiable information that StubHub shares with its service providers may only be used to provide services to StubHub and the service providers will not be given permission to use such information for other purposes.

_Business Transitions:_  
In the event StubHub goes through a business transition, such as a merger, an acquisition by another company, or a sale of all or a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days after a change of ownership or control of their personal information, if personal information will be used contrary to this policy. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, users will be given the option to continue sharing their information consistent with our notification of changes section. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with the ability of StubHub to transfer all or part of its business and/or assets (including the Site), for any purposes, without any limitation whatsoever. StubHub specifically reserves the right to transfer or share a copy of personally identifiable information collected from its Site to the buyer of that portion of its business relating to that information. 

**Security**

This Web site takes every reasonable precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with encryption software, currently SSL encryption. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also protect user-information off-line. Access to all users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted to our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. The servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, behind a locked cage at a professional hosting company. Although we endeavor to create secure and reliable Sites and to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. You hereby acknowledge that StubHub is not responsible for any intercepted information sent via the Internet, and you hereby release us from any and all claims arising out of or related to the use of intercepted information in any unauthorized manner.

**External Links**

The Site contains links to other web sites maintained by third parties. Please be aware that StubHub exercises no control over linked sites and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites. Each linked site maintains its own independent privacy and data collection policies and procedures, and you are encouraged to view the privacy policies of these other sites before providing any personal information.

**Changes to this Statement**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. Material changes to this policy will be posted on this website 30 days prior to execution.

**Children**

Children (persons under the age of 18) are not eligible to use this Web site unsupervised and we ask that children do not submit any personal information to us. If you are under the age of 18, you may only use this site in conjunction with and under the supervision of your parents or guardians. 

Effective [03/28/06]
