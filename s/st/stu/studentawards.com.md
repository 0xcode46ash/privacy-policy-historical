# StudentAwards Privacy Policy | StudentAwards.com - Money and support for all students

The StudentAwards Inc. privacy policy statement demonstrates our deep commitment to your privacy rights. Since we gather certain types of information about our users, we want the user to fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement describes what information we gather, the purpose for which we gather it, how we use it, disclose it, and how to correct or change it. 

**Usage Tracking  
**StudentAwards Inc. tracks information related to overall user traffic patterns throughout our site in order to make decisions regarding content and services. 

**Log Files  
**Log files are used to track and monitor traffic patterns on our site for maintenance purposes, to enhance usability and to improve overall user experience and site performance. 

**Registration**   
In order to use studentawards.com services, users are required to complete an online registration form. StudentAwards Inc. collects that information for the purpose of informing students, parents, educators and others about opportunities to obtain awards, scholarships, bursaries and other funding and useful goods and services related to schools and education generally. To register, the user is asked to supply certain personal information such as email address, name, and home address. StudentAwards Inc. also collects personal information such as postal code, age, gender, academic information, interests and hobbies. This information is required if the user wants to be matched to the awards in the studentawards.com scholarship database. 

**Notification of New Awards  
**On an ongoing basis, StudentAwards Inc. enters new awards into its database and also updates existing awards. When an existing user matches on a new or updated award, StudentAwards Inc. may send an email message or newsletter advising the user to return to the studentawards.com web site to view the new award information. These email messages may also contain messages provided by our sponsors. 

**Email Messages  
**StudentAwards Inc. periodically provides opportunities for our sponsors to send email messages to our users that are considered by StudentAwards Inc. to be relevant and of interest to the students, parents or educators who use our service. No personally identifiable information is released by StudentAwards Inc. to our sponsors without the user's consent. Email messages may also invite users to take advantage of various promotions, complete surveys, etc. that also allow our awards search service to be provided free of charge. We gather the email addresses of users who voluntarily opt-in during our registration process. Users may remove themselves from this email list by logging into their studentawards.com account and selecting the appropriate options located in the Account Settings section under My Profile. 

**User Comments/Posts

**User Feedback/Inquiries  
**Users have the ability to contact StudentAwards Inc. and provide us with their comments and feedback.

StudentAwards Inc. encourages you to review the privacy statements of the web sites you choose to link to from studentawards.com so that you can understand how those web sites collect, use and share your information.

StudentAwards Inc. uses this information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience on our web site, whether to match users with scholarships, bursary and grant information, to notify users of new awards that have been added to the database, to provide interactive or personalized elements or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users. StudentAwards Inc. also uses this information to shape our recommendations to sponsors and scholarship providers regarding scholarship, cash awards and offers that might be of interest to our members. 

We also use information, which users voluntarily provide, in order to send out electronic newsletters and mailings.
