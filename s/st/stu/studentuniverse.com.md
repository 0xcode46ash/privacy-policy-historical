**Privacy Policy for StudentUniverse**   
Our privacy policy is very important to us and governs our actions regarding your information at StudentUniverse. This document will tell you what information we collect from you, what we are going to do with the information, and your rights concerning the information. 

**Registration and Profiles**   
Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address), unique identifiers (like their Student ID numbers), and demographic information (like their zip code and age). We use your customer contact information from the registration form to send you information about our company and promotional material, if you opt in. Your contact information is also used to get in touch with you when necessary. You have the option of not receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. 

Unique identifiers (such as Student ID numbers) are collected to verify your identity. We do not share this data with anyone except agencies that verify identity. Specifically, we validate your eligibility for certain offers based on your age or status as a student. We realize the sensitive nature of this information, and guard these numbers very carefully. 

Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. On that form, we collect the customer's contact information (like your e-mail address) and financial information (like your account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders, information about our company, and promotional material from some of our partners to our customers. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the customer when necessary. Financial information that we collect is used to bill customers for products and services. As with registration information, we guard this very carefully. 

**Sharing Information**   
No personally identifiable information will be shared with our partners (although you may separately provide them such information). Some of your information may be shared on an aggregate basis only, but that information will not be sufficient to permit the recipient to identify you. 

As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy companies or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that StudentUniverse or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will, of course, be one of the transferred assets. 

Except as set forth in the Terms of Service and this Privacy Statement, we will not willfully disclose personal data about you to any third party without first receiving your permission. 

This site contains links to other Web sites. StudentUniverse is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other Web sites. 

**Spam**   
We take extreme efforts to not involve ourselves with junk mail companies. Our mail is as targeted as we can make it, and we allow you to opt out at any time. If you feel we aren't living up to our promise, please contact us at [help@StudentUniverse.com](mailto:help@StudentUniverse.com)

We occasionally run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like your email address). We use contact data from our contests to send users information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users have the option of not receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt out section below. 

**Public Forums**   
This site makes discussion boards available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information. The general rule you should follow is to not disclose any personal information in open forums. 

**Cookies**   
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies, but we do not store your personal data in those cookies. Some of our business partners use cookies on our site, but we have no access to or control over these cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. 

**Security**   
We follow industry standards for credit card transactions to make sure your information stays yours. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology, which is widely used and respected across the industry. SSL encrypts your name, address, telephone number, and credit card information before they are transmitted across the Internet, so you can feel safe about doing business with us. 

**Children's Guidelines**   
Children 13 and younger are not permitted to be members of StudentUniverse. Our younger visitors may use the site as non-members and can surf the content, but only members can buy tickets, post items on discussion boards, etc. 

**Choice/Opt Out**   
Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-= out of receiving communications from us and our partners at the point where we request information about the visitor. 

If you want to remove your information from our database, to not receive future communications, or to no longer receive our service, please email us at [help@StudentUniverse.com](mailto:help@StudentUniverse.com).
