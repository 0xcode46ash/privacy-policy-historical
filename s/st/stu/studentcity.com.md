## 1\. What information we gather and how we gather it.

At times, we send your Web browser a “cookie,” a small data file that's stored on your hard drive, to help us provide you with customized services. We do not and cannot use cookies to retrieve personal information from your computer.

### Membership Application and Online Registration

To process your StudentCity Membership and/or your online registration, we may ask you common required information including name, address, email address, school, class, date of birth, school ID (for student verification). To process a StudentCity purchase, separate from the StudentCity Membership, we will also require credit card or checking account information. In order to access your online account, you will be asked to select a username and password. We then ask for additional optional information including: student status, gender, expected graduation date, and class affiliations. In the future, you will also have the option to personalize your own site by providing additional optional information including: interests, Greek affiliation, major, and more. 

### Co-branded Membership Applications and Offers

In order to receive special offers from partners or affiliates, you may be asked to provide additional personally identifiable information. Information submitted as part of any co-branded or any other offer may be shared with these partners and affiliates in which case the partners’ use of such information will be governed by the privacy policy of that particular partner. 

### Contests/Promotions

When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address, e-mail address and other contact information. Other times, you may enter by simply entering your username and password. At no time will eligibility require a purchase on your part, but you may be required to become a Member of the site.

We do disclose aggregated data to our advertisers and co-branded partners to generate reports and marketing research. For example, we tell advertisers how many people saw or clicked on an ad and additionally, how many people saw or clicked on ads in different portions of our service. Where available, we may offer additional information about viewer characteristics. However this does not include personally identifiable information about you or your online usage patterns. Our advertisers allow us to provide our service to you. In return, they need to know how to effectively place their ads to potential customers.
