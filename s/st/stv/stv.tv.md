We use this information to track your movements through our Website, to find out how it is being used and to assess its usefulness.  Personal information about you is not collected during the tracking process.

We use Google Analytics, a popular web analytics service provided by Google, Inc.. Google Analytics uses “cookies” to help us analyse how users use the Website.

The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States.

Google undertakes not to associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.

  If you have Adobe Flash installed on your computer (most computers do) and you use our audio or video players, Google Analytics will try to store some additional data on your computer.  This data is known as a Local Shared Object or Flash Cookie.  This helps us to analyse the popularity of our media files.  We can count the total number of times each file is played, how many people watch videos right to the end and how many people give up half way through.  Adobe's website explains [how to control Flash cookies on your computer](http://tinyurl.com/Flash-controls).

  Please also note that when you register with [www.stv.tv](http://www.stv.tv/) we offer you a cookie to save your login details.  This means you will not need to use your username and password to access our content when using the computer on which the cookie is stored.  However, you will still need to use your username and password to access your profile.  The cookie file itself does not store your personal information.

  If you want to delete any cookies that are already on your computer, please refer to the instructions for your file management software to locate the file or directory that stores cookies.  You can access them through some types of browser.  Search in your cookie folders for 'stv’ to find our cookie or 'google' to find the Google Analytics cookie - you can delete them if you wish.
