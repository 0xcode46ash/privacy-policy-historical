# Privacy Policy | Stylistpick

### Introduction

This is the privacy policy for <http://www.stylistpick.com/>. The Site is operated by Stylefantasia Limited, trading as Stylistpick.com (we, us and our).

We are committed to protecting your privacy on-line. We appreciate that you do not want the personal information you provide to us distributed indiscriminately and here we explain how we collect information, what we do with it and what controls you have.

By using the Site, you consent to the collection and use of information in accordance with this privacy policy.

We reserve the right to change this privacy policy from time to time by changing it on the Site. This privacy policy was last updated on 15 September 2010.

### Personal information we may collect from you

We may collect and process the following personal information about you:

information (such as your name, email address, postal address, payment details and telephone number) that you provide by completing forms on the Site, including if you register as a user of the Site, subscribe to any service, upload or submit any material via the Site or request any information;  
in connection with an account sign-in facility, your log-in and password details;  
details of any transactions made by you through the Site;  
communications you send to us, for example to report a problem or to submit queries, concerns or comments regarding the Site or its content;   
information from surveys, promotions and competitions that we may, from time to time, run on the Site for research purposes, if you choose to respond to, or participate in, them. 

You are under no obligation to provide any such information. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services.

We may, from time to time, run referral programmes or similar initiatives, such as a "Tell a Friend" programme, that invite you to provide us with the contact details of someone who is known to you who may find our products or services to be of interest. By providing us with their details, you confirm that you have their permission to do so and must not provide us with the details of anyone from whom you do not have such permission.

### Uses made of your personal information

We will use the personal information you provide to:  
enable us to process your orders and to provide you with the services and information offered through the Site and which you request;   
administer your account with us;  
verify and carry out financial transactions in relation to payments you make online; and  
send you information we think you may find useful or which you have requested from us, including information about our products and services, provided you have indicated that you do not object to being contacted for these purposes.

You can tell us not to contact you with information regarding our products and services, either at the point such information is collected on the Site (by checking or un-checking (as directed) the relevant box) or, where you do not wish us to continue to use your information in this way, by following the unsubscribe instructions on any communications sent to you. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us using the contacting us details at the end of this privacy policy.

### Non-personally identifiable information

When you visit the Site, we may automatically collect system-related information about your visit, such as the type of internet browser you use, the website from which you have come to the Site and your IP address (the unique address which identifies your computer on the internet) which is automatically recognised by our web server. This system-related information does not, of itself, contain any personally identifiable information.

The Site also uses cookies and, although they do identify a user's computer, again, they do not, of themselves, personally identify users.

Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your hard drive to store and sometimes track information about you. Cookies are specific to the server that created them and cannot be accessed by other servers, which means they cannot be used to track your movements around the internet.

We use cookies to:  
recognise you when you return to the Site;  
allow you to navigate the Site more quickly and easily;  
store your preferences;  
customise elements of the layout and/or content of the pages of the Site for you.

We do not use cookies to store your credit or debit card details.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of the Site if you do so.

We use any of the system-related information referred to above, including cookies, to:  
administer the Site and assist in diagnosing technical problems;  
identify new and return visitors to the Site;  
estimate our audience size and patterns;   
carry out research on our users' demographics;  
audit the accessing of resources and downloading of data from the Site;   
assist in improving and updating the Site;   
assist in improving and developing our products and services.

### Information sharing

We may disclose aggregate statistics about visitors to the Site, customers and sales in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, sponsors and other reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes, but these statistics will include no personally identifiable information.

We may disclose your personal information to any of our affiliates, or to our agents or contractors who assist us in providing the products and services we offer through the Site, processing transactions, fulfilling requests for information, receiving and sending communications, updating marketing lists, analysing data, providing support services or in other tasks, from time to time. Our agents and contractors will only use your information to the extent necessary to perform their functions.

In the event that we undergo re-organisation or are sold to a third party, you agree that any personal information we hold about you may be transferred to that re-organised entity or third party.

We may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or if we believe that such action is necessary to prevent fraud or cyber crime or to protect the Site or the rights, property or personal safety of any person.

### Public forums

The Site may, from time to time, make chat rooms, message boards, news groups and/or other public forums available to its users. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when using these and never disclose your personal information.

### External links

The Site may, from time to time, contain links to external sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of such sites.

### Payment processing

Payments made on the Site are made through our payment service provider. You will be providing credit or debit card information directly to our payment service provider which operates a secure server to process payment details, encrypting your credit/debit card information and authorising payment. Information which you supply to our payment service provider is not within our control and is subject to our payment service provider's own privacy policy and terms and conditions.

### Security

We place great importance on the security of all personally identifiable information associated with our users. We have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information under our control. For example, our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorised personnel have access to personal information. Whilst we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it.

You should bear in mind that submission of information over the internet is never entirely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of information you submit via the Site whilst it is in transit over the internet and any such submission is at your own risk.

It is advisable to close your browser when you have finished your user session to help ensure others do not access your personal information if you use a shared computer or a computer in a public place.

### Storage of your information

Information that you submit via the Site is sent to and stored on secure servers operated by or on behalf of our hosting provider. Information submitted by you may be transferred by us to the third parties mentioned in the circumstances set out above (see information sharing) and also to our own office in the Isle of Man, which does not have similar data protection laws to the European Economic Area. Where we transfer your information we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected. By submitting information via the Site, you agree to this storing, processing and/or transfer.

### Your rights

You have a legal right under the Data Protection Act 1998 to a copy of all the personal information about you held by us. On request, we will provide you with a copy of this information, subject to a fee not exceeding Â£10. You also have a right to correct any errors in that information. As mentioned above, you have a right to prevent the use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
