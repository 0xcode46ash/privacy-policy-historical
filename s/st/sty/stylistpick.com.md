Opting out of providing information

You are under no obligation to provide any such information. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services and you may not be able to continue to hold a member account.

We may, from time to time, run referral programmes or similar initiatives, such as the Invite Your Friends scheme, that invites you to provide us with the contact details of someone who is known to you who may find our products or services to be of interest. By providing us with their details, you confirm that you have their permission to do so, and also that we may identify you to them as the friend who recommended them. You must not provide us with the details of anyone from whom you do not have such permission.

  * Ensure that the content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your compute.
  * Notify you about changes to our products and/or services.



If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (email or SMS) with information about goods and services similar to those that were the subject of a previous sale to you. If you are a new customer, we will contact you only by electronic means only if you have consented to this.

  * You can tell us not to contact you with information regarding our products and services, either at the point such information is collected on our website (by checking or un-checking (as directed) the relevant box) or, where you do not wish us to continue to use your information in this way, by following the unsubscribe instructions on any communications sent to you. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us using the 'Help & Contact' page on our website.



Information sharing

We may disclose aggregate statistics about visitors to our website, customers and sales in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, sponsors and other reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes, but these statistics will include no personally identifiable information.

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.



Public forums

Our website may, from time to time, make chat rooms, message boards, news groups and/or other public forums available to its users. We also have presences on a number of social networking sites. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when using these and never disclose your personal information.

External links

Our website may, from time to time, contain links to external sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of such sites and we suggest that you check those policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.

Payment processing

Payments made on our website are made through our payment service provider. You will be providing credit or debit card information directly to our payment service provider, which operates a secure server to process payment details, encrypting your credit/debit card information and authorising payment. Information that you supply to our payment service provider is not within our control and is subject to our payment service provider's own privacy policy and terms and conditions.

Security

We place great importance on the security of all personally identifiable information associated with our users. We have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information under our control. For example, our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as we consider to be appropriate and only authorised personnel have access to personal information. Whilst we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it.

You should bear in mind that submission of information over the Internet is never entirely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of information you submit via our website whilst it is in transit over the Internet and any such submission is at your own risk. It is advisable to close your browser when you have finished your user session to help ensure others do not access your personal information if you use a shared computer or a computer in a public place.

Storage of your information

Information that you submit via our website is sent to and stored on secure servers operated by or on behalf of our hosting provider. Information submitted by you may be transferred by us to the third parties mentioned in the circumstances set out above (see Information Sharing).

Your rights

You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting the data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking or unchecking (as directed) certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us using the Help & Contact page on our website.

You have the right under the Act to a copy of the personal information about you held by us. Your right of access may be exercised in accordance with the Act, and your request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with the details of the information we hold about you. You also have a right to correct any errors in that information.
