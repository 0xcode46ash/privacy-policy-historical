# StyleFeeder Privacy Policy

### Effective January 12, 2010

Welcome to StyleFeeder! We developed this privacy policy to demonstrate our commitment to protecting your privacy and to help you in understanding how we handle your personal information. Please note that if you decide to visit our site, your visit is subject to this privacy policy, the [copyright policy](http://www.stylefeeder.com/info/copyright.html) and our [terms of service](http://www.stylefeeder.com/info/terms-of-service.html). 

### Our Privacy Principles

1.We will never distribute, lend, share, sell or give your email address to anybody, except as expressly provided in this privacy policy.  
2.Your StyleFeeder password will never be distributed to anyone, except as expressly provided in this privacy policy.  
3.But you should remember that just about everything else that you do on StyleFeeder is public, from the products you post to the tags and comments you add. 

### The Information We Collect

In order to create your own StyleFeed, you will need to register to become a member of our site. To register, we ask that you provide an email address, a username, and a password. You will have the option to include an image and a short description of yourself as well. Registration is not necessary to post a comment on the [StyleFeeder blog](http://blog.stylefeeder.com/), but we do ask that you provide your email address. 

Your username (and if you choose, your image and short description) along with any items you add to our site, messages you post on StyleFeeder and comments you post on the StyleFeeder blog are visible to the general public. You may, however, choose to submit such messages and comments anonymously.  
Your email address, username and password that you provide to StyleFeeder will be used in accordance with this privacy policy and customary industry practices. 

### Your Email Address

We use your email address to perform the following tasks: 

1.To answer email that we receive from you;  
2.To remind you of your password if you request it; and  
3.To send you up to two confirmation emails when you register.  
You may not opt-out of receiving these transactional emails. 

We also use your email address to perform the following: 

1.To send you alerts and updates about our site; and  
2.To send you our weekly newsletter.  
For example, you can choose to be notified by email when someone adds you to their watchlist. These messages are all optional, and you can unsubscribe from them at any time on the [My Account / Notifications page](http://www.stylefeeder.com/myaccount-notifications.html).

If you use the “email a friend” feature to tell a friend about an item that you see on our site, we will use that email address only once to notify the friend of the item. 

If you provide your email account username and password while using our easy invitation system, we will not store your email account password in any way. 

### Sharing Information

Except as described in this privacy policy, we will not share personally identifying information about you with third parties. We may share personally identifying information about you with third parties if required by law, when we believe that it is necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of StyleFeeder, our employees, our users or others and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website. 

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if StyleFeeder, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred.  
In addition, we may share non-identifying or aggregate information that we collect using log files with advertisers, retailers and/or the media. Log files are not tied to personally identifiable information. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our site, but we will not disclose anything that could be used to identify those particular individuals.

Please note too that we occasionally employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. 

### Your Access to Your Information

You can access and correct all of your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by clicking the “My Account” button and logging in. You can also contact us to request a change of your data by emailing info@stylefeeder.com. In addition, if you do not want your username listed in a StyleFeeder Forum member directory or to receive information related to our site, you may contact us at info@stylefeeder.com at any time. 

### Cookies

At times, in order to offer and provide optimized and personalized services, we may use cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. You can remove cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. If you reject all cookies, you may still browse our site, but your ability to add items to StyleFeeder may be severely limited. We also track IP addresses and we use this information for diagnosing problems with our website and analyzing patterns that help us provide you a better experience on our site. 

Some of our business partners (e.g., Google Analytics) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. 

### Other Sites

Please note that this site contains links to other sites not controlled by us. We ask that you please review the privacy policies of these other sites, as we cannot be responsible for the privacy or other practices of such sites. 

### Security

To try to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place certain physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

If you have any questions about security on our website, you can send email to us at info@stylefeeder.com. 

### COPPA Compliance

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important to us. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information from those we actually know are under 13 years old, and no part of our website is structured to attract such persons. 

### Modifications To This Policy

We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you by means of a notice on our home page. 

### Contact Information

If after reviewing this privacy policy, you should have any questions or concerns about it, please send an email, in English, to info@stylefeeder.com or write to us at:
