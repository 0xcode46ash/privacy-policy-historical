# Privacy Policy | StyleCaster

Welcome to StyleCaster! StyleCaster, Inc. (“ **StyleCaster** ,” “ **we** ,” “ **us** ,” or “ **our** “) operates a number of websites (including  **[http://www.StyleCaster.com](http://www.stylecaster.com/)** , **news.StyleCaster.com** ,  **BeautyHigh.com** ) (the applicable website on which you are, a “ **Site** “) as well as a number of related services, including our mobile application (collectively, the “ **Services** “). The focus of our Sites and Service is to let you get opinions, give opinions, communicate with other users, and connect with people like you.

Because we gather important information from users of the Site and Services, we have established this Privacy Statement as a means to communicate our information collection, use and dissemination practices. The Privacy Statement applies to you whether or not you register as a “ **Member** ” or browse the Site as a “ **Visitor** “, where “you” or “your” refers to the person accessing or using the Sites or Services. In order to access and use the Sites and/or Services, you must agree to our Terms of Use and any other applicable terms. Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Statement will have the meaning ascribed to them in the Terms of Use.

So we are clear on the terminology we use, “ **Personal Information** ” means contact information (i.e., your name, address, email address, and/or telephone number) and any other non-public information that is used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual, and any other non-public information that is associated with that information. “ **Anonymous Information** ” means information that is not used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual.

**BY USING OUR SITE OR SERVICES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH ONE OF OUR SITES OR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT AND YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT. YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US OR ON OUR BEHALF IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.**

## CHILDREN

The Site and Services are not directed to children and children are not eligible to use our Sites or Services. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. We do not collect or maintain Personal Information from people we actually know are under 13 years of age, and no part of our Site or Services is designed to attract people under 13 years of age. If we later learn that a user is under 13 years of age, we will take steps to remove that user’s Personal Information from our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the Site and the Services.

## COLLECTED INFORMATION

### Personal Information

In general, the Personal Information we gather enables us to provide the Site to you and helps us learn more about the use of the Site and/or Services. We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily at registration for the Site, and in the course of using the Site, such as when you communicate with us. As you use the Site, you will be required to register with us. To register, you may connect through Facebook or Twitter (see below for information on this process), in which case we collect information from such site about you, including your profile picture and other information that you make generally available on Facebook (some of which may be optional), or you may open an account by providing your name, email address and a password directly to us. Either way, we require your name, email address and location-based information to register.

Most of this Personal Information will be used by us to better provide the Services to you, but your name and profile picture will be used in your online profile that we make available on our Site (your “Profile”). Your Profile will also contain all of the information you provide through the Site, such as comments, and other optional information that you provide, such as age, gender, marital status, education and interests (collectively, “Profile Information”). When you comment through the Services about content on the Site, including when you “Love” content, this information is associated with your Profile and thus made available on the Site as being associated with you. Your Profile Information may also contain a list of StyleCaster users who “follow” you or who you “follow”. To follow another StyleCaster user, you simply make a request on that Member’s Profile page.

As your Profile Information is intended by you to be made publicly available, your Profile Information will not be considered Personal Information under this Privacy Statement, even though it contains Personal Information. We may use and disclose the Profile Information on the Site and through the Services in connection with your Profile. Please be thoughtful about what you post and make publicly available through our Services.

### Anonymous Information

As you use the Site or Services, we may collect and store Anonymous Information including your Internet protocol address, domain names, browser and device type, and access times. We may also use Cookies (as defined below) or web bugs and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit, and your geo-location (from your IP address). “ **Cookies** ” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your browser while you are viewing a website. Standing alone, Cookies do not personally identify you but merely recognize your web browser. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your browser until you delete them) to improve your experience on the Site (e.g., by keeping you logged in). Many consider the use of Cookies to be industry standard, and our Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, you may need to log-in again each time you use the Services.

## Disclosure – Usage of Third Party Cookies

We may use third party tracking services to track and analyze Anonymous Information users of our Site and Services. Such third parties may use Cookies to help track user behavior.

Additionally, we may also enable advertisers and ad servers to promote third-party products and/or services by placing advertisements through the Services. These advertisers and ad servers may use Cookies in order to monitor information related to served advertisements. Clicking on such advertisements will direct you to the website of a third-party and the advertiser. This Privacy Statement does not cover the privacy practices of any advertisers or ad servers.

## Our Relationship with Social Networking Sites

We have created and may offer you interfaces that allow you to connect with social networking websites such as Facebook and Twitter (“ **SN Sites** “) through our Site. We will work with the SN Site’s application protocol interface (better known as their developer API) in a way that allows you to authorize us to access your account on that SN Site on your behalf. In order to provide this authorization, you will not provide us with your user name or password to the SN Site, but you will need to log-in to that SN Site directly through our Site. Once authorized by you, the SN Site will provide us a token that allows the SN Site to recognize us when we ask, on your behalf, for access to your account information or to post information. You will be able to revoke our access to any SN Site at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within your account settings on the applicable SN Site, though such revocation may limit the Services we are able to provide you. StyleCaster will never post information to third party SN Sites without your authorization.

## USE OF INFORMATION

#### Personal and Profile Information

We will use your Personal Information to:

  * Administer your account;
  * Provide you and other Members with Services and customer support;

  * Market our products and services (and those of third parties) to you that we believe may be of interest to you, including through the mailing of gifts to your postal address and the serving of personalized advertisements, though we will not disclose your Personal Information in doing so. For example, we allow advertisers to choose the characteristics of Members who will see their advertisements and we may use any of the non-personally identifiable attributes we have collected (including information you do not make available on the Site) to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements. For example, if you tend to view and comment on fashion-related content, we might use that interest to show you ads for new clothes (and to tell ad networks to serve those ads), but we do not tell any clothing retailer who you are to display the advertisement, though the retailer may learn that you possess certain characteristics based on the fact that you received the advertisement.



We may use your Personal Information to create Anonymous Information by excluding information that makes the information personally identifiable to you.

#### Anonymous Information

We may, through our use of Cookies and web bugs, keep you logged into our Site or Services, collect your click-stream data, and personalize your experience on the Site or Services (including by tailoring content to you).
