Privacy Policy

Your information is private and secure

At St.George we value your privacy. When you give us information about yourself we keep that information private. We also keep information about the accounts you operate private.

We also appreciate that security of online services is an essential concern to users. Our service provides the maximum level of security to on-line customers. Please click on "Security" to read further about our security.

Information we collect from our Website

When you visit our website we collect the following types of information: the number of visitors to our site; the type of browser used; the number and type of pages viewed and the documents downloaded; the date and time of visits and other similar patterns of usage. We use this information to evaluate our website performance and to continually improve our service to you. 

We cannot identify you from this information.

If you use our online banking, you provide us with your personal information and we also monitor the time you spend online and the type of transactions you conduct. This information is essential for our provision of banking services.

Email Address

We only collect your email address if you have provided it to us. We may use your email address to notify you of: changes to our online service; the management of your account or if we have scheduled interruptions to internet banking for maintenance purposes.

You may change your email address on the internet at anytime or elect to remove yourself from our notification list by simply blanking out the email address field.

How we store your information

We take all reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

Any personal information you provide to us is stored either electronically or at one of our secure warehouses or both. Access to information stored electronically is restricted to staff whose job purpose requires access. Even then a personal password is required to access the information. We require all staff to maintain the confidentiality of customer information

Accuracy of your personal information

We take reasonable steps to ensure that any personal information we hold about you is accurate, complete and up to date. Please contact us whenever there is a change to your personal information or as soon as you are aware that the details we have about you are not entirely accurate.

Can we disclose your information to other persons?

Usually we must get your consent before we tell anyone about you, your accounts or your credit worthiness. We can't even tell your partner or family without your consent. You can give your consent directly to us or indirectly by your conduct.

Sometimes the law requires us to give out information about you. If this is the case we cannot say no. For example, we must tell the Australian Taxation Office how much interest we pay you.

We may disclose information about you to outside contractors to carry out specialised activities on our behalf, such as a mailing house. Any outside contractor may only use the information for our business and is strictly prohibited from using the information for any other purpose.

When you apply for a loan with St.George, the application form contains notices and agreements under the Privacy Act. These notices tell you the type of information about your credit worthiness that we can give to and receive from a Credit Reporting Agency. This information helps us to assess your application for credit or your position if you are in default. 

When you sign the loan application form you agree to our giving and receiving information to or from other financial institutions that you have dealt with or may deal with in the future. You also agree to our giving information to a guarantor.

Companies in the St.George Group

We may give information about you to companies related to us to help us work out the total amount you owe our group of companies or we owe you. An example of a related company is a company we own like St.George Life Limited.

We may also give information to a related company if it provides services that are related to the ones we provide. We won't give information about you to a related company for this reason if you ask us not to. You can do this by writing to us. You must give the account numbers of all accounts with us and the full name of all account holders and your current address.

Application of our Privacy Statement

This Privacy Statement was last reviewed in March 2001. It is subject to change from time to time due to developments in technology and new laws. We encourage you to periodically review this Statement. This Privacy Statement does not apply to parties that may be linked or associated with our site; those site owners are responsible for the privacy of the information they collect.
