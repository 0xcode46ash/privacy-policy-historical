**Cookies**

A cookie is a text file that a web site can send to your browser and which may then be placed on your computer. We do not use cookies; sometimes a third-party contractor will use cookies on one of the sites they create and manage for us -- for example, our Job Opportunities site. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether to accept it or not. You can also set your browser to not accept cookies at all. If you do so, however, some areas of some sites (including ours) may not operate properly. 

**Information Collected Automatically**

We collect statistical information about our users in aggregate. We perform analyses on our web server's log files to identify, among other things:

  * Our site's most popular pages; 
  * The browsers and operating systems most often used by our visitors; 
  * The sites and search engines that have referred visitors to our site; and 
  * The domains from which our users visit us.



This analysis does not involve personally identifiable information. It is used only for the purpose of helping us understand and better meet our audience's needs.

**Disclosure of Information**

Any information collected on this web site, whether individual or aggregate, is for Federal Reserve use only. We do not rent, sell or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide information you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:. 

  * We retain the services of outside contractors to provide services, including mailing list administration and our Job Opportunities pages. We require that these contractors keep information obtained through our web site secure and confidential. We also require that these contractors use personal information obtained through our web site only on behalf of the Federal Reserve.
  * We may be required to disclose your personal information to government officials or otherwise as required by subpoenas, court orders, legal process or other legal obligations and to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
