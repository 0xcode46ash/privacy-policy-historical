In those cases, where we are not the operator or host of the contest or sweepstakes, we do not collect your information and we have no control over the information collected from you. Accordingly, we urge you to review the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy policy applicable to the contest or sweepstakes before participating.

Our website offers promotions that involve other parties, to varying degrees. Here is how we treat user information in each type of promotion:

  1. Promotions run by the Rams and we do not share information with 3rd party sponsor: In these cases, the Rams collect all relevant information from users such as name, email, mailing address, email type, favorite player, gender, birth date. In these promotions, the Rams privacy policy applies. The Rams do not share this information with any 3rd parties. 
  2. Promotions run by the Rams, but collected information may be used by the Rams and/or 3rd party sponsor: In these cases, the Rams collect all relevant information from users such as name, email, mailing address, email type, favorite player, gender, birth date. Users will be given the option to allow the 3rd party sponsor to see their information. This option will be signified by checking a checkbox that reads “Receive email from the St. Louis Rams regarding special offers from the Rams and our partners.” In these cases, the 3rd party sponsor may see the information. Once the information is transferred to the 3rd party, the 3rd party’s privacy policy applies.3. Promotions where the 3rd party collects the information: In these cases, the Rams do not collect the information. The page upon which the registration occurs will clearly look like the 3rd party’s website, and not the Rams. The 3rd party’s privacy policy will apply to collected information. In some cases, the 3rd party may provide some information back to the Rams. This will only occur if the user chooses to allow the Rams to see the information. When the information is transferred to the Rams, the Rams privacy policy will apply. Surveys or Voting: From time-to-time we may request personally identifiable information from you in conjunction with a survey or voting poll. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website.

Links to other Websites

You should be aware that when you are on the Website you could be directed to other Websites beyond our control. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, the "click" may take you off the Website onto a different Website. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and marketing partners that may use the Website's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other Websites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If you visit a Website that is linked to our Website, you should consult that Website's privacy policy before providing any personal information.

The Website utilizes framing techniques to make it appear that the user is still on the site when the user is actually on a third party Web site. For example when you use our Chat feature you will be taken to a third party site, but the page is framed with the St. Louis Rams branding. Note that the third party’s privacy policy governs the collection and use of the data collected on these pages.

Security

This Website incorporates reasonable safeguards to protect the security, integrity, completeness, accuracy and privacy of the personal information that we may collect and we have put into place reasonable precautions to protect such information from loss, misuse and alteration. Your personally identifiable information is transferred to our computers utilizing encryption software.

Your California privacy rights

A California privacy law that went into effect on January 1, 2005, allows California residents to obtain specific information about a business’s privacy practices if it shares information with other companies for those companies’ direct marketing purposes.

As explained in this privacy policy, whenever you agree to let us collect personal information about you, we will always provide you with an option to prevent this information from being shared for non-administrative purposes with third parties.
