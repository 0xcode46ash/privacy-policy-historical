Privacy Policy

The organisers of St. Patrick's Festival respect your right to privacy and our Privacy Policy is designed to inform you of the methods and purposes for which we gather and use your data.

**Information Collected by St. Patrick's Festival**  
Each time you visit the website, two general levels of information about your visit may be retained by us: 1) non-personal information and 2) personal information. 

**1) Non-personal Information**  
Like most websites, we gather statistical and other analytical information collected on an aggregate basis of all visitors to this site. This includes pages viewed, date and time, and browser type. IP numbers are not stored, but are temporarily used to determine domain type and in some cases, geographic region. We use this information to get a better understanding of where our visitors come from and to help us better design and organize our website. We do not make any association between this information and a visitor's identity.

**2) Personal Information**  
Personal information is information that is personal or particular to a specific visitor who chooses to provide that information. This category would typically include information provided by you for subscriptions, competitions, online surveys, or applications including your name, postal and email address and contact phone number.

**Purposes for which we hold your data**  
We keep your personal and non-personal data for the following purposes: 

  1. To communicate with you and provide you with marketing and festival information
  2. To personalise our correspondence with you
  3. To establish how to improve our service to you
  4. To notify you of competitions or other promotions
  5. For the performance of any request by you



By entering your details into the fields requested, you enable St. Patrick's Festival to provide you with the services you select. Whenever you provide such personal information, we will treat that information in accordance with this policy. St. Patrick's Festival does not collect personal information from you unless you provide it to us. This means that you can visit our site without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself.

St. Patrick's Festival will act in accordance with current legislation and aim to meet current Internet best practice.

**Transfer of Data**  
Your data will be held by St. Patrick's Festival. We will share non-personal information with our advertisers and business partners. We will only share personal information with our business partners if we are satisfied that it will only be used in accordance with the purposes described above. 

We will also disclose your personal information if we are legally required to do so or if it is reasonably necessary to protect and defend the rights or property of St. Patrick's Festival.

We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, and processing credit card payments. These companies have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

**Security**  
Your personal data is held on a secure server hosted by Dreamhost and is not publicly accessible. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, St. Patrick's Festival cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we use our reasonable commercial efforts to ensure its security on our systems. Furthermore, personally identifiable information is only accessed by St. Patrickâ€™s Festival employees on a "need to know" basis. St. Patrick's Festival meets or exceeds all industry standards for the protection of personally identifiable information.
