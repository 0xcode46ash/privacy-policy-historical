# Staples Promotional Products Privacy Policy

Last updated 3/27/2008

At Staples Promotional Products, we value the trust you and your company place in us and are committed to protecting your privacy and the integrity of the information you share with us online. We take the protection and proper use of your personal information seriously and are committed to protecting the personal information in our possession. By sharing our privacy policy, we hope to help you understand what personally identifiable information is collected from you when you shop StaplesPromotionalProducts.com, how we use that information, and the choices you have about our use of that information. While more detailed information follows, here is an overview of our policy:

  * We do not give or sell personal or confidential information about you, your company, or your account to any third party that isn't affiliated with your transaction except as required by law, or as necessary to provide you with the services you requested, or as requested and authorized by you. 
  * We use state-of-the-art security technologies to protect your personal information from disclosure or theft. 
  * We provide the means for you to change your personal information.
  * We provide some personal information to those third parties who must access that information in order to meet your needs (e.g., shipping companies, credit card processing services). 
  * We provide anonymous information about StaplesPromotionalProducts.com use and product purchase trends to your company in order to assist with the ongoing product and inventory decisions related to StaplesPromotionalProducts.com. 



Collecting Information About You

In general, you can visit our web pages without telling us who you are or providing any personal information about yourself. We may track the Internet domain address from which people reach StaplesPromotionalProducts.com as well as other anonymous information about your visit and analyze this data for trends and statistics – but in these instances you will remain anonymous unless you voluntarily tell us who you are. This anonymous information is used to help us improve the performance of StaplesPromotionalProducts.com, administer the site, and analyze trends.

To provide you with the best possible customer service and/or to fulfill your order or request, there are times when we ask you to provide information about yourself. Those times include when you purchase a product, subscribe to email updates, participate in promotions or sweepstakes, request a catalog, etc. The information we collect may include your name, shipping/billing address, telephone number, e-mail address, and credit card information (if you are making a personal purchase). In some cases, we may also collect information about the division or department in which you work, your work cost center, and other work-related information (on work-related purchases). We also maintain a record of your online product purchases.

Providing personally identifiable information is always your choice; however, if you choose not to provide this information you may be unable to purchase products or access some promotions or services through StaplesPromotionalProducts.com.

How We Use Information About You

We use the personally identifiable information you provide for internal purposes-to provide the services and carry out the transactions you have requested or authorized, including processing and authorizing credit cards, confirming and tracking your order, providing updated information regarding your order or request, and in general to provide you with excellent and effective customer service.

We also use this information to make your shopping experience easier so that you are not required to repeatedly enter the same information, to allow you to keep track of your favorite StaplesPromotionalProducts.com items and past orders, and to make it easy to shop during several sessions.

Although unlikely, in certain instances we may disclose your personally identifiable information when we believe the law requires it. 

Except as otherwise described, your personal information will not be shared outside of Staples Promotional Products and its controlled subsidiaries and selected service providers without your permission.

Special information for StaplesPromotionalProducts.com shoppers

If you shop with us online, we use third–party advertising technology to help us improve our marketing efforts. This technology uses non–personally identifiable information about your visits to StaplesPromotionalProducts.com and the sites upon which we advertise. We use Coremetrics, a service provider, to assist us with data collection and reporting. As part of that process, a "session cookie" may be placed on your browser. You can generally set your browser to not accept cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. 

A session cookie is a small data file that is placed on the hard drive of your computer when you visit a website. A session cookie expires immediately when you close your browser; a persistent cookie stores information on the hard drive so when you end your session and return to the same website at a later date, the cookie information is still available. When you visit StaplesPromotionalProducts.com, we use both session and persistent cookies. 

Coremetrics does not have the right to use the information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us. For more information, including how to opt–out, go to [www.coremetrics.com/info_eluminate2.html](http://www.coremetrics.com/info_eluminate2.html). During the course of delivering our online advertisements to you, a unique third–party cookie may be placed on your browser. We also use a technology called "web beacons" that enable our advertising service provider to track which advertisements bring users to our site. To learn more about our third–party advertising service provider and how to "opt–out", please go to [www.doubleclick.com/com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/](http://www.doubleclick.com/com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/).

Keeping Your Information Secure

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of personally identifiable information provided to us through StaplesPromotionalProducts.com or other ordering mechanisms. These include secure servers, passwords, firewalls, encryption software and security software. 

To safeguard your information, StaplesPromotionalProducts.com uses Secure Sockets layer (SSL) technology to pass information from your computer to our web servers. Along with other information, SSL encrypts your credit card number, name and address so only we can decode this information. Please note that e-mail is not encrypted and is not considered to be a secure means of transmitting credit card information.

Credit card information is stored on our servers in an encrypted manner so that it can only be read by those individuals and processes necessary to complete your purchase transaction. Staples Promotional Products routinely purges credit card information once a transaction is complete.

You can verify that your transaction is secure by looking at the bottom status bar of your browser window. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (these symbols are determined by your specific browser), the SSL is active and your information is secure. If for some reason you are unable to connect to our secure server, please call the customer service number listed on this site.

Protecting Children

We will never knowingly request or collect personal information from any person under the age of 13.

Because StaplesPromotionalProducts.com has a largely business focus and is hosted by Staples Promotional Products, it is unlikely that children will access the Staples Promotional Products URL, or once accessed, it is unlikely that they would linger to shop. Still, we do not knowingly permit children under the age of 18 to purchase products on StaplesPromotionalProducts.com, nor do we permit anyone under the age of 13 to register with us. We also do not send e-mails to anyone who tells us that they are under the age of 13. 

E-Mail Opportunities 

We may occasionally send you e-mail messages about new products or services, special offers, promotions or other information of special interest to you. If you prefer, you may choose not to receive these messages by clicking on the opt-out link at the bottom of your e-mails. To learn how to mange your preferences for communications from Staples Promotional Products, contact us at 7500 W. 110th Street, Overland Park, KS 66210.

Privacy Policy Changes

This policy is subject to change. We may occasionally revise our privacy policy in whole or in part. When we do so, we will revise the "Last Updated" date displayed at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy periodically.
