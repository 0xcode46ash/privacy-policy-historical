#### Online Privacy Protections

On our web site, https://www.starone.org, you may apply for accounts and services and you may communicate with us via e-mail. To protect the information you provide us online, we use multiple levels of security. Our online applications and forms and our Online Banking service relies on industry standard "Secure Sockets Layer" (SSL) encryption to secure your transaction information and communication. However, if you send e-mail to service@starone.org it will not be secure. When you visit our web site, you can access information, without revealing your personal identity. If you input your member number and password to enter Online Banking, we will use "cookies" to authenticate you and track your visit for Online Banking sessions. These "cookies" will be used to help us identify you for future Online Banking sessions. A "cookie" is a piece of information that our web server stores on your computer hard drive and retrieves later. The "cookie" will not request, require or collect personal identity information other than the information used to authenticate you for Online Banking access.

#### Protecting Children's Information Privacy.

Our online financial services are not directed toward or designed for use by children. We do not knowingly solicit or collect data from children and we do not knowingly market to children online.
