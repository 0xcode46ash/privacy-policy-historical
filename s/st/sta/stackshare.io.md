Last updated: October 20, 2014

This Privacy Policy describes StackShare's (operated by Leanstack, Inc.) policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information when you use the StackShare Service, via the StackShare website. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our [Terms of Service.](https://web.archive.org/terms)

##### Information Collection and Use

StackShare uses information we collect to analyze how the Service is used, diagnose service or technical problems, maintain security, personalize content, remember information to help you efficiently access your account, monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns, and track User Content and users as necessary to comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other applicable laws.

##### User-Provided Information

If you use your GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, or other social networking site account information to sign in to StackShare, we will collect and store your social networking site user ID and associated public information.

You also provide us information in User Content you post to the Service. Your reasons, reviews, comments and other contributions on the Service, and metadata about them (such as when you posted them), are publicly viewable on the Service, along with your GitHub ID. This information may be searched by search engines and be republished elsewhere on the Web in accordance with our [Terms of Service.](https://web.archive.org/terms)

##### Information Collected Automatically

When you use the Service, we may use persistent and session cookies and other tracking technologies to: (a) analyze the usage of the Service; (b) customize the Service to your preferences; and (c) control the advertising displayed by the Service. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.

We may also use other Internet technologies, log files, clear GIFs, Flash technologies, and other similar technologies, to deliver or communicate with cookies and track your use of the Service. We also may include clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to determine whether the message has been opened. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather additional information through other methods.

We use these automated technologies to collect and analyze certain types of information we consider to be non-personal information, including: (a) information related to the devices you use to access or interact with the Service, such as: IP addresses, geolocation information, unique device identifiers and other information about your mobile phone or other mobile device(s), browser types, browser language; and (b) information related to the ways in which you interact with the Service, such as: referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time you used the Service, and other similar information. We may also capture other data, such as search criteria and results.

StackShare discloses a subset of this automatically collected information publicly. Specifically, you consent to StackShare's disclosure of information related to the ways in which you interact with the Service, such as: landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages (including questions and answers viewed), the date and time you used the Service, and other similar information on the Service to other StackShare users, along with your username. If you do not wish to have this information disclosed to the public, you may opt out by contacting us directly at info@stackshare.io.

StackShare may allow third parties to serve advertisements on the Service and on third-party services and use other third parties to help us collect and analyze information about your use of the service, generate aggregate site usage statistics and provide content sharing services to support the Service. These third parties may also use cookies and similar technologies to collect similar non-personal information about your use of the Service. StackShare does not control the third parties' use of such technologies and their use is governed by those parties' privacy policies.

##### How We Share Your Information

Personally Identifiable Information: StackShare may share your personally identifiable information with third parties for the purpose of providing the Service to you or with third parties offering combined services with StackShare. For example, we may share your personally identifiable information with third-party partners that display StackShare reviews through their services so that such partners can tailor content and advertising to you. If we do this, such third parties' use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of StackShare (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).

##### Links to Other Web Sites

We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the Service, nor the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our website, is subject to that website's own rules and policies.

##### Your California Privacy Rights

California law permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed their personally identifiable information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the types of personally identifiable information disclosed to those parties. If you are a California resident and would like to request this information, please submit your request in an email to info@StackShare.io.

##### Changes to Our Privacy Policy

If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on this page to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
