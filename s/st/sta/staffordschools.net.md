# Stafford County Public Schools - Internet Privacy Policy Statement

### _Stafford County Public Schools_

_(last updated on March 28, 2001)_

The following information explains the Internet Privacy Policy which the Stafford County School Board has adopted for its website (web pages at addresses beginning with "http://www.pen.k12.va.us/Div/Stafford"). The following is intended to explain our current Internet privacy practices, but shall not be construed as a contractual promise. We reserve the right to amend our Internet Privacy Policy Statement at any time without notice.

**_Virginia law_**

We protect our records in accordance with our obligations as defined by applicable Virginia statutes, including, but not limited to, the "Virginia Privacy Protection Act of 1976", the "Virginia Freedom of Information Act", and by any applicable U.S. federal laws.

**_Links to other websites_**

Our website may contain links to other public or private entities' websites, whose privacy practices we do not control.

**_Information we collect_**

When you access our website, the routing or client information, and the essential and nonessential technical information listed below, is automatically collected. No other information is collected through our website except when you deliberately decide to send it to us (for example, by clicking on a link to send us an email). The information you might choose to send us is listed below as "optional information."

> _Routing, or client, information_ : the Internet domain and Internet address of the computer you are using.
> 
> _Essential technical information_ : identification of the page or service you are requesting, type of browser and operating system you are using; and the date and time of access.
> 
> _Nonessential technical information_ : the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our website [, and the "cookie information" described below].
> 
> _Optional information_ : when you send us an e-mail, your name, e-mail address, and the content of your e-mail; when you fill out online forms, all the data you choose to fill in or confirm.
> 
> _Cookies_ : Our website does not place any "cookies" on your computer.

**_How the collected information is used_**

Routing information is used to route the requested web page to your computer for viewing. We send the requested web page and the routing information to our Internet service provider or other entities involved in transmitting the requested page to you. We do not control the privacy practices of those entities. Essential and nonessential technical information helps us respond to your request in an appropriate format [or in a personalized manner] and helps us plan website improvements.

Optional information enables us to provide services or information tailored more specifically to your needs or to forward your message or inquiry to another entity that is better able to do so, and also allows us to plan website improvements.

We may keep your information indefinitely, but we ordinarily delete the transaction routing information from our computer within 30 days after the web page is transmitted and do not try to obtain any information to link it to the individuals who browse our website. However, on rare occasions when a "hacker" attempts to breach computer security, logs of routing information are retained to permit a security investigation and in such cases may be forwarded together with any other relevant information in our possession to law enforcement agencies. We use this transaction routing information primarily in a statistical summary type format to assess site content and server performance. We may share this summary information with our business partners when needed.

Optional information is retained in accordance with the records retention schedules at the Library of Virginia.

Under the "Virginia Freedom of Information Act", any records in our possession at the time of a "Freedom of Information Request" might be subject to being inspected by, or disclosed to, members of the public. However, all identifiable confidential/personal information will be removed prior to releasing the routing information.

**_Choice to provide information_**

There is no legal requirement for you to provide any information at our website. However, our website will not work without routing information and the essential technical information. Failure of your browser to provide nonessential technical information will not prevent your use of our website, but may prevent certain features from working. Failure to provide optional information will mean that the particular feature or service associated with that part of the web page will not be available to you.

**_Customer comments or review_**

If you have questions about this privacy statement or the practices of this website, or if you choose to review or correct any information you previously submitted, please contact us at [webmaster@scps.k12.va.us](mailto:webmaster@scps.k12.va.us)

**ยง 2.1-378. Findings; principles of information practice.**

A. The General Assembly finds:

1\. That an individual's privacy is directly affected by the extensive collection, maintenance, use and dissemination of personal information;

2\. That the increasing use of computers and sophisticated information technology has greatly magnified the harm that can occur from these practices;

3\. That an individual's opportunities to secure employment, insurance, credit and his right to due process, and other legal protections are endangered by the misuse of certain of these personal information systems; and

4\. That in order to preserve the rights guaranteed a citizen in a free society, legislation is necessary to establish procedures to govern information systems containing records on individuals.

B. Record-keeping agencies of the Commonwealth and political subdivisions shall adhere to the following principles of information practice to ensure safeguards for personal privacy:

1\. There shall be no personal information system whose existence is secret.

2\. Information shall not be collected unless the need for it has been clearly established in advance.

3\. Information shall be appropriate and relevant to the purpose for which it has been collected.

4\. Information shall not be obtained by fraudulent or unfair means.

5\. Information shall not be used unless it is accurate and current.

6\. There shall be a prescribed procedure for an individual to learn the purpose for which information has been recorded and particulars about its use and dissemination.

7\. There shall be a clearly prescribed and uncomplicated procedure for an individual to correct, erase or amend inaccurate, obsolete or irrelevant information.

8\. Any agency holding personal information shall assure its reliability and take precautions to prevent its misuse.

9\. There shall be a clearly prescribed procedure to prevent personal information collected for one purpose from being used for another purpose.

10\. The Commonwealth or any agency or political subdivision thereof shall not collect personal information except as explicitly or implicitly authorized by law.

Any such entity included in this definition by reason of a contractual relationship shall only be deemed an agency as relates to services performed pursuant to that contractual relationship, provided that if any such entity is a consumer reporting agency, it shall be deemed to have satisfied all of the requirements of this chapter if it fully complies with the requirements of the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act as applicable to services performed pursuant to such contractual relationship. 

**ยง 2.1-380. Administration of systems including personal information; Internet privacy policy.**

8\. Take affirmative action to establish rules of conduct and inform each person involved in the design, development, operation, or maintenance of the system, or the collection or use of any personal information contained therein, about all the requirements of this chapter, the rules and procedures, including penalties for noncompliance, of the agency designed to assure compliance with such requirements;

At minimum, the policy and the statement shall address (i) what information, including personally identifiable information, will be collected, if any; (ii) whether any information will be automatically collected simply by accessing the website and, if so, what information; (iii) whether the website automatically places a computer file, commonly referred to as a "cookie," on the Internet user's computer and, if so, for what purpose; and (iv) how the collected information is being used or will be used.   


**ยง 2.1-380.1. Same; military recruiters to have access to student information, school buildings, etc.**

  
If a public school board or public institution of higher education provides access to its buildings and grounds and the student information directory to persons or groups which make students aware of occupational or educational options, the board or institution shall provide access on the same basis to official recruiting representatives of the military forces of the Commonwealth and the United States for the purpose of informing students of educational and career opportunities available in the military.

2\. Make no materials available for independent analysis without guarantees that no personal information will be used in any way that might prejudice judgments about any data subject.   


**ยง 2.1-382. Rights of data subjects.**

A. Any agency maintaining personal information shall:

1\. Inform an individual who is asked to supply personal information about himself whether he is legally required, or may refuse, to supply the information requested, and also of any specific consequences which are known to the agency of providing or not providing such information.

2\. Give notice to a data subject of the possible dissemination of part or all of this information to another agency, nongovernmental organization or system not having regular access authority, and indicate the use for which it is intended, and the specific consequences for the individual, which are known to the agency, of providing or not providing such information, however documented permission for dissemination in the hands of such other agency or organization will satisfy this requirement. Such notice may be given on applications or other data collection forms prepared by data subjects.

3\. Upon request and proper identification of any data subject, or of his authorized agent, grant such subject or agent the right to inspect, in a form comprehensible to such individual or agent:

> (a) All personal information about that data subject except as provided in ยง 2.1-342 B 3.   
>  (b) The nature of the sources of the information.   
>  (c) The names of recipients, other than those with regular access authority, of personal information about the data subject including the identity of all persons and organizations involved and their relationship to the system when not having regular access authority, except that if the recipient has obtained the information as part of an ongoing criminal investigation such that disclosure of the investigation would jeopardize law-enforcement action, then no disclosure of such access shall be made to the data subject.

4\. Comply with the following minimum conditions of disclosure to data subjects:

> (a) An agency shall make disclosures to data subjects required under this chapter, during normal business hours.   
>  (b) The disclosures to data subjects required under this chapter shall be made (i) in person, if he appears in person and furnishes proper identification, or (ii) by mail, if he has made a written request, with proper identification. Copies of the documents containing the personal information sought by a data subject shall be furnished to him or his representative at reasonable standard charges for document search and duplication.   
>  (c) The data subject shall be permitted to be accompanied by a person or persons of his choosing, who shall furnish reasonable identification. An agency may require the data subject to furnish a written statement granting permission to the organization to discuss the individual's file in such person's presence.

5\. If the data subject gives notice that he wishes to challenge, correct, or explain information about him in the information system, the following minimum procedures shall be followed:

> (a) The agency maintaining the information system shall investigate, and record the current status of that personal information.   
>  (b) If, after such investigation, such information is found to be incomplete, inaccurate, not pertinent, not timely, or not necessary to be retained, it shall be promptly corrected or purged.   
>  (c) If the investigation does not resolve the dispute, the data subject may file a statement of not more than 200 words setting forth his position.   
>  (d) Whenever a statement of dispute is filed, the organization maintaining the information system shall supply any previous recipient with a copy of the statement and, in any subsequent dissemination or use of the information in question, clearly note that it is disputed and supply the statement of the data subject along with the information.   
>  (e) The agency maintaining the information system shall clearly and conspicuously disclose to the data subject his rights to make such a request.   
>  (f) Following any correction or purging of personal information the agency shall furnish to past recipients notification that the item has been purged or corrected whose receipt shall be acknowledged.

B. Nothing in this section or found elsewhere in this chapter shall be construed so as to require an agency to disseminate any recommendation or letter of reference from or to a third party which is a part of the personnel file of any data subject nor to disseminate any test or examination used, administered or prepared by any public body for purposes of evaluation of (i) any student or any student's performance, (ii) any seeker's qualifications or aptitude for employment, retention, or promotion, or (iii) qualifications for any license or certificate issued by any public body.   
As used in this subsection, "test or examination" shall include (i) any scoring key for any such test or examination and (ii) any other document which would jeopardize the security of such test or examination. Nothing contained in this subsection shall prohibit the release of test scores or results as provided by law, or to limit access to individual records as is provided by law; however, the subject of such employment tests shall be entitled to review and inspect all documents relative to his performance on such employment tests.   
When, in the reasonable opinion of such public body, any such test or examination no longer has any potential for future use, and the security of future tests or examinations will not be jeopardized, such test or examination shall be made available to the public. Minimum competency tests administered to public school children shall be made available to the public contemporaneously with statewide release of the scores of those taking such tests, but in no event shall such tests be made available to the public later than six months after the administration of such tests.

C. Neither any provision of this chapter nor any provision of Chapter 21 (ยง 2.1-340 et seq.) of this title shall be construed as denying public access to records of the position, job classification, official salary or rate of pay of, and to records of the allowances or reimbursements for expenses paid to any public officer, official or employee at any level of state, local or regional government in this Commonwealth whatsoever. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to records of the official salaries or rates of pay of public employees whose annual rate of pay is $10,000 or less.

D. Nothing in this section or in this chapter shall be construed to require an agency to disseminate information derived from tax returns in violation of ยงยง 2.1-342 and 58.1-3.
