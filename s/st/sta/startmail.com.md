# StartMail - Privacy Policy

## StartMail Privacy Policy

### StartMail Has Been Developed to Protect Your Privacy

StartMail believes that privacy is a fundamental human right. Using StartMail, you can protect yourself against unwarranted intrusion and mass surveillance, and take back your right to communications privacy. Our core values include "privacy by design" and "minimal data retention". 

#### Our core values are:

  * ##### Privacy by design

Privacy shouldn't be an afterthought. We built StartMail from scratch, and privacy has always been our main objective.
  * ##### Encryption made easy

Encryption is a must to achieve privacy. While existing encryption solutions for email are cumbersome, StartMail makes encryption easy for everyone.
  * ##### Optimal security

Privacy and security must go hand in hand. There can be no privacy without security.
  * ##### Minimal data retention

As a webmail provider [the EC telecom data retention directive](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32006L0024) does not apply to us. We store and process as little personal information about you as possible.
  * ##### Transparency of purpose

We have no hidden agenda with your information. If we store your data at all, we always tell you exactly why. 
  * ##### Responsible protection of users' civil rights

We believe communications privacy is a fundamental right. StartMail protects your email against unauthorized and unconstitutional intrusions.
  * ##### Transparency about our solutions and remaining threat vectors

100% privacy or security does not exist. We strive to be as open and clear as possible about what our solution can and cannot offer.



Definitions of the capitalized terms are included in the [Terms of Service.](https://www.startmail.com/legal/terms_of_service/terms_of_service.pdf)

### StartMail Complies with the World's Toughest Privacy Laws

StartMail is based in The Netherlands, Europe, where privacy laws and regulations are among the strictest in the world. 

For example, to comply with the [Dutch personal data protection act](http://www.dutchdpa.nl/Pages/en_ind_wetten_wbp.aspx) (In Dutch, the "Wet bescherming persoonsgegevens"):

  * We clearly state the purposes for which we process personal data. This can be found in our privacy policy.
  * We strive to limit the collection of personal data to only those personal data that are necessary for legitimate purposes, such as to create your Account and process your payments.
  * We implement appropriate security measures to prevent loss and unauthorized access to your personal data.
  * We respect your right of inspection, correction and removal of your personal data, upon your request.



### We Put You Back in Control

We are fully transparent about which data we process and why. We put you back in the driver's seat when it comes to your data. 

Your inbox and other personal information are yours even though we help you by storing it and making it accessible through our user-friendly interface. Exactly which parts of your data are processed by us and why, depends on how you are using our website and the StartMail Service.

##### 1\. Visiting our website

When you visit the website, the following details are automatically processed for the duration of your session:

  * Your IP address  
> to allow effective troubleshooting.
  * Browser language settings  
> to show you the website in the right language.
  * Browser type  
> to display the website in the right format for your browser.
  * Operating system  
> to display the website in the right format for your system.
  * Origin of your visit (such as whether you directly typed the website URL, or accessed it through a search engine query or link from another website).  
> to assess the success of our search engine optimization and information outreach efforts.



When your session ends, all of this information is either deleted or anonymized with the exception of the IP address. The IP address will be anonymized (using a SHA-256 hash with salt) after a maximum of 48 hours, and completely deleted within a maximum of 3 days for Premium accounts, and 33 days for beta accounts.

We collect the anonymized information above, excluding the SHA-256 hash of your IP address, on an aggregate level, in order to analyze usage trends and for troubleshooting purposes.

##### 2\. Signing up for an Account

When signing up for the StartMail service, you are asked to provide: 

  * A name that you choose (optional and may be an alias or pseudonym, but see also our [Terms of Service](https://www.startmail.com/legal/terms_of_service/terms_of_service.pdf).),  
> so that we are able to address you when we communicate with you.
  * Your desired email address (required),  
> to register your StartMail email address.
  * A password (required),  
> to provide authentication for your Account. 
  * A Recovery Email Address (optional, see also our ToS),  
> so that we are able to communicate with you in the event that you need to recover access to your StartMail Account should you ever lose your password.
  * An invite code (optional, if you have one),  
> so that we are able to give you the benefit of a promotional offer.
  * Your preference as to whether you would like to subscribe to our newsletter(s),  
> so that we are able to send you our news letters should you wish to receive them.



##### 3\. Paying for a Premium Account

For the Premium StartMail Service, we offer various payment methods.

A specialized payment provider (Ogone) processes payment and registers card numbers and secure codes. They have strict security standards, as laid down in the [Payment Card Industry Security Standards (PCI DSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard), with which they are fully compliant. They store any account payment details under a unique number, but cannot connect the payment data to the account email address. The StartMail system also works with this unique number and has no direct access to Ogone’s system - effectively separating the two systems. StartMail also offers anonymous payment methods for additional privacy.

Please consult the [Privacy Policy of our payment provider](http://www.ogone.com/int/en/cookie-policy) to learn which of your data Ogone needs to process and why.

##### 4\. Using the StartMail Service

  * All of your email messages are stored in a secure User Vault on our servers. All information in the vault is encrypted (see StartMail Gives You Ironclad Data Protection on how we use encryption to protect your data)
  * Everything you can see through the regular user interface (your inbox and folders, including spam folder) is stored safely in the User Vault.
  * Additionally, the following is also stored in the User Vault: 
    * personalized spam preferences of the User as part of the self-learning process of the spam filter
    * a search index, which allows an efficient email search functionality



For several functions in the StartMail Service, such as logging in or account recovery, a SHA-256 hash of your IP-address is stored for several minutes for the purpose of preventing brute force attacks.

When you use the StartMail Service to send an email, your IP address is not included in the header of the email. Instead our IP address is shown.

##### 5\. Communicating with Us

Under certain circumstances you may provide information about yourself to us. For example, you may provide us with information, by sending feedback or asking a question. If this information can be linked, without disproportionate effort, to your real identity, we will treat it as personal information.

We strive to ensure that any of your personal information we obtain through your communication with us, is used solely to address the reason you contacted us. We will make every reasonable effort to delete any personal data that is no longer needed from our systems. Our support system is physically completely separated from the StartMail system. If you request that we delete any record of your communications with our support staff, we will generally be able to do so.

##### Deleted is Deleted

When you delete an email, it is immediately deleted from our production servers, unlike what happens with many other webmail providers. Only on the [off-site backups](https://support.startmail.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/46/0/time-delay-after-deletion-of-email) (which are fully encrypted, of course) will a copy remain for the maximum retention period of three days.

Your Account will be stored for as long as our Agreement remains in force. When an Agreement is fully terminated, all data contained in the Account, including all emails, will be deleted permanently.

##### Viewing and Amending Your Personal Data

If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy or if you have questions about viewing, amending or deleting your personal data, you can contact us via email at: legal@startmail.com.

### No Tracking or Advertising – Guaranteed

StartMail is an ad-free service. Tracking cookies are strictly forbidden on our StartMail servers. We use non-tracking cookies only to the extent that this is necessary to provide a smooth and user-friendly experience. 

A cookie is a simple, small file that is sent along with pages from a website and stored on your computer's hard disk by your browser. Advertising networks often use cookies to track users across multiple websites and to build personalized profiles. They also have other tracking techniques at their disposal such as web beacons, web bugs, pixel tags and browser fingerprinting. StartMail does not use any of these tracking techniques.

Other webmail providers collect and use your personal data to display personalized ads to you. As a result you pay for your webmail with your privacy. We think your privacy is worth more than gold. Therefore we don't show any ads, we don't track your behavior online and we don't build any personal profiles of you.

Furthermore, StartMail prevents potentially dangerous remote images and any other third-party content to be loaded automatically when you open an email. It is possible to explicitly choose to always load this content automatically in your Settings.

StartMail uses seven cookies, named “SMSESSID”, “SMSESSIDK”, “SMSESSIDQA”, “SMSESSIDQAK”, "SMRU”, “pgp_kc_*” and “cookietest”.

These are session-only cookies, or expire as chosen, whose sole purpose is to allow you to use StartMail smoothly and keep you from having to repeatedly supply your login details again for every action that you take in StartMail.

### StartMail Gives You Ironclad Data Protection

We use state-of-the-art technical and organizational security measures to protect your data. 

**On the technical side** , we use state-of-the-art cryptography to protect your data. For example:

  * Traffic between the User and our servers is encrypted with SSL, and [perfect forward secrecy](https://support.startmail.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/2/0/perfect-forward-secrecy) is applied.
  * We only store passwords in hashed form on our servers.
  * Your StartMail inbox and its folders are stored in your own encrypted User Vault. Your User Vault is only opened when you login. When it is closed it is inaccessible to everyone, including StartMail employees.
  * When you are logged out of StartMail, your entire inbox is encrypted. When you are logged in, your unencrypted emails are unencrypted, but all of your PGP-encrypted emails are still encrypted unless you open an encrypted email by submitting your PGP-passphrase.
  * Users can encrypt emails via Open PGP.
  * The user's key-pair is stored in the User Vault. Additionally, the private key is encrypted by means of the passphrase. Without the passphrase, the private key cannot be decrypted or used.
  * We only use validated encryption algorithms that are considered safe by respected cryptographers.



For more detailed information about our technical security measures, please read our Security White Papers. These have not yet been released, but are expected to be available by the official StartMail launch.

**On the organizational side** , we have strict protocols in place to ensure the safety of your data. For example:

At each level, access to our systems is restricted to authorized staff with a legitimate need to know. This access is tightly limited, and is only for the purpose of providing the StartMail Service to you.

Any individual, who is given access to the StartMail system, is required to sign a confidentiality agreement.

No third party, contractor, or sub-contractor of StartMail is given access to the system, except for the purpose of enabling us to provide the StartMail Service to you. All such parties must sign a data processing agreement, containing confidentiality provisions and stringent security protocols.

##### Compliance with Legitimate Requests by Authorities

While we respect and try to protect your privacy to the best of our abilities, your use of StartMail does not place you above the law. But neither do we place authorities above the law. ONLY when we receive a request from Dutch judicial authorities to hand over information about one of our Users, will we have our lawyers check the validity of the request and determine whether we are obliged to comply. We will NOT comply with such requests unless we are convinced that the request is legally valid and we believe that it is undeniably our legal obligation to comply.

We will NOT comply with requests from any authorities other than Dutch authorities. If we receive a request from any foreign government, we will refuse to comply and will instead instruct the requestor to place a formal request to the Dutch authorities for mutual assistance.

StartMail will never cooperate with any voluntary surveillance programs. Under the strong laws that protect the right to privacy in Europe, European governments cannot legally force service providers like StartMail to implement a blanket-spying program on their users.

##### Requests by Private Third Parties

We will NOT comply with any requests from private third parties to provide information about our Users, unless we receive a valid Dutch court order and we believe it is undeniably our legal obligation to comply.

##### We Will Not Reduce Your Rights without Your Explicit Consent

We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will be posted on this page, and we will provide a more prominent notice, such as an email message, if we believe a change significantly affects your privacy. You may also review older versions of our Privacy Policy through our Website.
