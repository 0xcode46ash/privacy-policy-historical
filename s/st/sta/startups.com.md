[Home](https://web.archive.org/) : [About Us](https://web.archive.org/content.jsp?page=overview) : Privacy Policy  ****

At Startups.com we respect your privacy and strive to ensure that any personal information you provide is protected. The following describes our commitment to the privacy of your information, the information we gather, and how that information is used. 

This site has security measures in place to help protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. The information is stored in a secure operating environment. 

All Startups.com mailing lists are 100% OPT-IN. We will never send you email unless you first request it or join a Startups.com administered mailing list. Additionally, your email address and personal information is reserved for internal use only and will never be sold or shared to any third party. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings. 

Startups.com does record and track IP addresses, browser information (such as version, make and model), and referring links (i.e. how you got to the page). This information helps us analyze site traffic patterns and usage as well as improve our product offering and quality of service. Startups.com will use and disseminate to our partners non-identifying aggregate demographic information for market research purposes. Again, please realize that this information cannot be used in any way to identify you, but instead to understand the profiles of our typical users and broad web site usage patterns. 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. We use cookies (bits of information that are stored on your hard drive) to help us identify you and present your personalized information, such as the events you are planning or are invited to attend. Any password saved through use of a cookie will expire when you close your browser; this ensures your security. 

This site contains links to other sites. Although we are very selective in choosing our partners, Startups.com does not assume any responsibility for or make any warranties about the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

Startups.com uses eLuminate™ by Coremetrics™, a data-gathering and analysis service, to ensure visitors and customers of our site receive relevant information and promotions that will help them make better purchasing decisions. Visitors to our site are identified by a unique numeric ID that enables us to determine shopping behavior. **This numeric ID does not include any personal demographic information about our users.** The aggregate information we gather with the unique ID is analyzed to improve our site design, broaden the products we carry, and suggest products, promotions, or other features that will complement your other purchases. 

As a visitor to Startups.com, you have the option to deactivate the site’s abilities to analyze your Web browsing and purchasing behavior. For the Coremetrics™ Opt-Out Standard, please visit [http://www.coremetrics.com](http://www.coremetrics.com/), where you will find detailed information on data collection and instructions for selecting the various levels of privacy and confidentiality that you desire. 

Protecting your privacy is one of our highest priorities, but as with all Web sites, ours may be vulnerable to service interruptions, intentional attacks, or other events that may compromise the security of our site and the information contained therein (including that which you provide). Accordingly, by submitting such information, you acknowledge and agree that Startups.com is not responsible for any direct or consequential damages that may result from such events.
