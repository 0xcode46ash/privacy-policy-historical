Startups, Inc. is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. The following provides a brief overview of our information gathering and dissemination practices for the www.startups.com Web site.

Our Web site allows individuals to browse its contents and use our public services while remaining completely anonymous. However, some users may choose to sign up for our premium services, which often involves completing a registration form. Our registration forms require users to give us contact information (like their name and e-mail address), financial information (like details about their company's level of funding), and demographic information (like their zip code, industry, or job title). From time to time, Startups, Inc. uses the information collected during the registration process to e-mail promotional materials, special offers, and other information to our registered users. For information about how these users may choose not to receive these materials, please see the Opt-Out Procedures section below.

Startups, Inc. does not collect any information from users browsing our site's public services. However, Startups, Inc. uses eLuminate™ by Coremetrics™, a third-party data-gathering and analysis service, to ensure that visitors and customers of our site receive relevant information and promotions that will help them make better purchasing decisions. Coremetrics identifies each visitor to our site with a unique numeric ID. This numeric ID does not include any personal demographic information about our users. The aggregate information we gather with the unique ID is analyzed to improve our site design, broaden the products we carry, and suggest products, promotions, or other features that may interest our users. For information on opting out of the data gathering and analysis performed by Coremetrics, please see the Opt-Out Procedures section below.

Startups, Inc. collects data from our registered users and from users who participate in our optional surveys to perform statistical analyses on their aggregate characteristics. Financial information we collect is used to determine each user's qualifications for registration and for inclusion in our survey results. Demographic data is also collected at our site to provide an aggregate profile of our registered users and our survey respondents. Startups, Inc. shares no specific information about any registered users, unless such users have granted Startups, Inc. permission to forward their information to potential partners, customers, investors, or other organizations.

For registered users and subscribers to our premium services, our Web site uses session cookies to identify and deliver content that our users may have personalized during previous visits.

Our site provides users with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from Startups, Inc. and our partners on pages where we request specific information from them. Users may choose not to receive these materials by (a) opting not to receive promotional mailings from us during the registration process; (b) changing the preferences on their account to keep from receiving future mailings; or (c) following the "unsubscribe" instructions included with each e-mail.

As a visitor to our Web site, you have the option to deactivate the site's abilities to analyze your Web browsing behavior. For the Coremetrics™ Opt-Out Standard, please visit [http://www.coremetrics.com](http://www.coremetrics.com/), where you will find detailed information on data collection and instructions for selecting the various levels of privacy and confidentiality that you desire.

Startups, Inc. has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of any information under our control. All user accounts are password-protected and encrypted, and any user-specific information is stored behind a secure firewall. Further, employees of Startups, Inc. have been made fully aware of the company's commitment to security, and they continually strive to protect the privacy of the site's users.
