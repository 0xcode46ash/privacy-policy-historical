# Privacy policy

Last Update: 22 June 2013 

Stampin' Up! UK Limited (hereinafter “Stampin’ Up!”) provides this privacy statement to inform you of how your personal data are processed and in what form some of these data are made accessible to third parties. Please read this privacy statement carefully. By using this website, you accept the terms of this privacy statement. 

Our Policy 

Stampin’ Up! is committed to the protection and security of data that you provide us, and we treat all personal data with the utmost care, taking all necessary steps to guarantee the security of your data. This privacy statement applies to the websites [www.stampinup.com](http://www.stampinup.com/), and all websites of Stampin’ Up! Demonstrators which are hosted by Stampin’ Up! through the DBWS program (the “Stampin’ Up! Sites”). This Privacy Statement supplements the General Terms and Conditions of Business of Stampin’ Up!. 

1\. Type and nature of the data collected and processed. 

1.1 Personal data 

When you register with us, we record and save your basic data such as name and e-mail address, together with other contact information such as user name and password. We may receive further information from you via the website (e.g. if you fill in your personal profile) or if you communicate with us. 

If you place orders on the Stampin’ Up! Sites, we will need your name, delivery address, billing address, email address, phone number, credit card number and the expiry date so that we can process the transaction and inform you about the status of your order. 

2\. How we collect data 

2.1 Cookies 

After you have logged in (with user name and password), Stampin’ Up! uses cookies with which you can be identified for the duration of your visit. Cookies are small files stored on your computer or mobile device which identify the device to our server and also provide additional data. Other technologies such as pixel tags, web bugs, web storage and similar files fulfill the same purpose. A cookie is saved on your computer. 

One type of cookie automatically expires after your session has ended. This is called a session cookie. Your user settings, in particular, are saved as session cookies so that this website can always be used in the form you require. Another permanently stored anonymous cookie contains the version number of your Flash player. In addition to this, user settings, such as language selection, language recognition settings, user IDs for various applications, are saved in both session cookies and permanent cookies by Stampin’ Up! in order to facilitate theuse of the website. 

You can switch off the use of cookies for our website or in general in the settings of your Internet browser. You can find out how this functions from the website of your Internet browser. 

For Apple Safari: 

2.2 Log files 

Stampin’ Up! uses third-party tracking services that use technology to track non-personal information about visitors to this website. Each time a page is called up, access data are saved in a protocol file, the server log. The data record thus saved contains the following data: 

• your IP address (by means of which your computer can be unambiguously identified) 

• the remote host (name and IP address of the computer requesting the page) 

• the time, the status, the quantity of data transferred and the Internet page from which you 

accessed the requested page (referrer) 

• The product and version information of the browser used (user agent) 

A standardized web server log file format is used for this purpose. Provided these data are not urgently required for the technical maintenance of the system or for the system security, they are anonymized instantly and the original protocols are deleted. Anonymization takes place by removal or truncation of the IP address by allocating a code not assigned to a user. Any allocation to an identified or identifiable person is therefore no longer possible. Stampin’ Up! uses protocol data (logs) exclusively in anonymized form for statistical evaluations, without any allocation or references to your personal details. This enables us to detect possible program errors or faulty links, and allows for ongoing development and refinement of the website. Stampin’ Up! does not link the page requests and usage information to individual persons. 

2.3 Web Analysis Software 

Data collected may include time and duration of the visit, which pages are visited, the browser used and add-ons/plugins, search-engines and referrer. Cookies may be used to distinguish between individual visitors, but the collected data does not allow for the identification of individuals. 

Google Analytics. This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how you use the site. As anonymization is activated for the data we collect, your IP address is truncated by Google within member states of the European Union or in other signatory countries to the Treaty creating the European Economic Area and only then is it transferred to the USA. 

Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and truncated there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website in order to compile reports on website activity for the website operator and to provide other services relating to website activity and Internet usage. The IP address transferred by your browser within the scope of Google Analytics will not be combined with other data from Google. 

You may prevent the saving of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser; however, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. Furthermore, you can prevent the data captured by the cookie and relating to your use of the website from being captured and processed by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB. 

Further information on the use of the data and privacy policy at Google Analytics is available at: 

http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html or 

http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/. 

Stampin’ Up! uses Google Analytics exclusively in connection with the “gat._anonymizeIp();” extension so that IP addresses are only recorded in truncated, i.e. anonymized form. 

2.4 Clear Gifs (Web Beacons / Web Bugs) 

We may use a software technology called clear gifs (aka Web Beacons / Web Bugs), to help us manage content on the website by measuring which content is most effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar to cookies in terms of the function and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are invisible. We do not link the information collected through clear gifs with the personal data of our customers. 

2.5 E-mails 

Any e-mail messages we send are saved by us and any e-mails that may be regarded as business letters will not be deleted during the statutory retention period. We also record any e-mail addresses to which messages were undeliverable in order to request an updated e-mail address. E-mail messages from Stampin’ Up! may contain graphics or links which, when called up, allow us to determine whether an e-mail message has been opened. This takes place anonymously. 

3\. Purpose of collecting and storing the data 

The purpose of gathering, saving, processing and using the data is to facilitate, maintain and develop the website, to fulfill your orders, and to implement Stampin’ Up!’s compensation plan. Part of our ongoing development involves the use of anonymous statistics on the usage of services.

Demonstrator may use your e-mail address, postal address and / or phone number to provide customer service or to contact you regarding the status of orders, problems with products or fulfillment and other customer service issues. Stampin’ Up! and your Stampin’ Up! Demonstrator send you e-mails for a variety of reasons, including confirmations of orders.

If you provide information to an Independent Demonstrator through this website, Stampin’ Up! will have access to such information and shall treat it in accordance with this Privacy Statement. Independent Demonstrators may provide Stampin’ Up! with information regarding their customers, in which case Stampin’ Up! will treat such information, once in its possession, in accordance with this Privacy Statement. 

If you are the customer of an Independent Demonstrator, you should check with your Demonstrator directly to learn about her data privacy practices. 

4.5 Disclosure resulting from change in entity.
