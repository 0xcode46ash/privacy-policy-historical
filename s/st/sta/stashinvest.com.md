Such information, which may be collected passively using various technologies or through other means, is anonymized using standard industry practices.

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes, among others, internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. Stash may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Stash affiliates, agents or service providers. Stash may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the domain names of our visitors’ Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with the Services. Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Stash often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to Stash by Issuers and Users.

In operating this Site and App, we may also use data collection tools such as web beacons, pixel tags, embedded links, cookies, and other similar techniques. A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately.

In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site’s features.

The use of cookies by any of our affiliates or service providers is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site and use our Services.

In addition, if the benefit the employer or affiliate group provides includes embedding the Stash experience in a broader experience hosted by the employer or affiliate, by using such benefit you consent to Stash embedding the Stash experience in the hosted experience, and understand that your Personal Data may be shared in order to implement the hosted experience.

We will share personal and other information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data and other information with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:

Affiliates: We may also share your Personal Data with our affiliates for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. Our affiliates are our subsidiaries and companies that we control, are controlled by, or are under common control with.

Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: Stash, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include website hosting, mailing information, maintaining databases, ID verification, processing applications, processing payments and completing transactions. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
