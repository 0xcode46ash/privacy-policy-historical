# Privacy Statement

[](http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.startech.com&sealid=101) Effective: 10/29/2007 

StarTech.com is committed to protecting your privacy. We recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of all information provided by users of our web sites and promotions. You can help us ensure your privacy by not sharing your account user name or password with anyone. StarTech.com has established this privacy policy, so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your information. 

StarTech.com USA LLP is a licensee of the TRUSTe Web Privacy Seal Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build user’s trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the Web site www.startech.com. Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. 

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first visit <https://www.startech.com/Support/TechSupport.aspx>. If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact TRUSTe at <http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with us to resolve your concerns. 

**Registration**  
In order to make a purchase over the web site or register an account with us, you must submit personal information to the site in order for us to fulfill your requests for products and services. This information will include your name, email address, phone number, credit card information and address. Your contact information will also be collected by us if you wish to contact us for sales or support help. You may access this information in order to update or change it at any time by logging into the web site and going to your “My Account” page when logged in. 

**Security**  
We take every precaution to protect our users' personal information and to store it securely. We protect your credit card information and other sensitive personal information by using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology (the industry standard security protocol), hosting our site on secure servers, and maintaining Secure Site status from Geotrust owned by VeriSign, the security industry leader. In addition, access to all of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Your information is safely stored behind a firewall that protects it from users from other networks. Finally, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. 

**Catalogs and Flyers**  
We require only the personal information that is needed for safely processing your online order and for contacting you about your transactions. It is used exclusively for that purpose. If you become a StarTech.com customer, you may receive mailings from your account information and your account information may be analyzed as part of our standard business practices. 

**Surveys and Contests**  
From time to time we invite users to provide information via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether to disclose requested contact information (such as name and mailing address) and demographic information (such as zip code/postal code or job title). In addition to other uses set forth in this policy, contact information collected in connection with surveys and contests is used to notify the winners and award prizes, to monitor or improve the use and satisfaction of the site. 

**Service Providers**  
We will share your information with companies who provide specific services to us such as shipping and the processing of your credit card information. We have contracts written with these companies and we review their privacy and security practices thoroughly before selecting them to provide our services. These companies are not allowed to use the information we provide to them for any reason other than what it is they are contracted to do. The Live Chat function on our web site is also considered a service provider. They will collect your name for the sole purpose of providing you with a more personalized experience on their hosted site. 

**E-mail Newsletters**  
If users wish to subscribe to our e-mail newsletters, we ask for contact information (such as name, e-mail address and, occasionally, demographic information). We use this information in the same manner as we use contact information in the registration and ordering process described above. Recipients of our newsletters can unsubscribe using the instructions listed at the end of the e-mail newsletter. 

**Cookies and Web Tracking**  
Some parts of StarTech.com's website use cookies to track user traffic patterns and to remember which country you have set. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information and to give the user the best possible web experience. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. The web tracking cookies only track usage and general page visitation and trends and do not record personal information. 

**Correct inaccurate Information**  
You can update your basic account information at any time. To correct any other account information, please contact your account manager. We will attempt to keep customer information complete, up to date, and accurate. 

**Removal From StarTech.com Lists**  
You may receive periodic emails or postal mailings from us with information on new products and services, or upcoming events. If you do not want to receive e-mail and/ or postal mail from us in the future, please let us know by sending us an email at support@startech.com. StarTech.com does not currently rent, sell or otherwise forward your name or other personal information to other companies.

**Legal Disclosure**  
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site. 

**Testimonials**  
We have posted testimonials on our web site that include the display of personal information. These testimonials were collected offline and the individuals who provide them also give StarTech.com expressed consent to place their personal information in a public area. 

**Business Transitions**  
In the event StarTech.com goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email or prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.
