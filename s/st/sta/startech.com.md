# StarTech.com - The Professionals' Source for Hard-to-Find Computer Parts

StarTech.com is committed to protecting your privacy. We recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of all information provided by users of our web sites and promotions. You can help us ensure your privacy by not sharing your account user name or password with anyone. StarTech.com has established this privacy policy, so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your information. 

**Security**  
We take every precaution to protect our users' personal information and to store it securely. We protect your credit card information and other personal information by using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology (the industry standard security protocol), hosting our site on secure servers, and maintaining Secure Site status from VeriSign, the security industry leader. In addition, access to all of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. We use Cookies (small encrypted data files containing references to user ID information that are stored on our secure server and may write to your hard drive) to keep track of your shopping cart. Your information is safely stored behind a firewall that protects it from users from other networks. Finally, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. 

**Catalogs and Flyers**  
We require only the personal information that is needed for safely processing your online order and for contacting you about your transactions. It is used exclusively for that purpose. If you become a StarTech.com customer, you may receive mailings from your account information and your account information may be analyzed as part of our standard business practices.

**Surveys and Contests**  
From time to time we invite users to provide information via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether to disclose requested contact information (such as name and mailing address) and demographic information (such as zip code/postal code or job title). In addition to other uses set forth in this policy, contact information collected in connection with surveys and contests is used to notify the winners and award prizes, to monitor or improve the use and satisfaction of the site.

**E-mail Newsletters**  
If users wish to subscribe to our e-mail newsletters, we ask for contact information (such as name, e-mail address and, occasionally, demographic information). We use this information in the same manner as we use contact information in the registration and ordering process described above. Recipients of our newsletters can unsubscribe using the instructions listed at the end of the e-mail newsletter.

**Correct inaccurate Information**  
You can update your basic account information at any time. To correct any other account information, please contact your account manager. We will attempt to keep customer information complete, up to date, and accurate. 

**Removal From StarTech.com Lists**  
You may receive periodic emails or postal mailings from us with information on new products and services, or upcoming events. If you do not want to receive e-mail and/ or postal mail from us in the future, please let us know by sending us an email at support@startech.com. StarTech.com does not currently rent, sell or otherwise forward your name or other personal information to other companies.

**Links To Other Sites**  
It is important for StarTech.com users to realize that StarTech.com's privacy policy applies solely to information collected on this Site. Although the Site contains links to other sites, StarTech.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. For privacy information regarding other sites, please refer to their individual privacy policies.
