## Our Commitment To Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. 

INFORMATION COLLECTED BY STAR SEARCH CASTING INC.   
Star Search Casting, Inc. collects two types of personally identifying information from users: personal data (such as names and e-mail addresses); and aggregated data (such as information about traffic patterns on Star Search Casting, Inc., for example how many users log into Star Search Casting, Inc. on a daily basis). 

PERSONAL DATA   
Personal data is collected when users provide personal data to Star Search Casting, Inc., for example in registering for electronic newsletters or other membership services, in answering surveys, purchasing items from Star Search Casting, Inc., and registering for contests and other promotional opportunities provided by Star Search Casting, Inc. In addition, we collect the e-mail addresses of users who post messages to our message boards and chat areas. 

AGGREGATED INFORMATION   
Aggregated information, such as which pages users access or visit and information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or site registrations, is collected through various methods. For example, Star Search Casting, Inc. collects IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages; automatically identify your computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from Star Search Casting, Inc., our servers log your IP address. Star Search Casting, Inc. does not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, so although your session will be logged, you will remain anonymous to us. Star Search Casting, Inc. collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to provide aggregate data to advertisers about the volume of use on Star Search Casting, Inc. 

USE OF COOKIES   
Star Search Casting, Inc. also uses "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that most major Web sites write to your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow Star Search Casting, Inc. to measure activity on the Site and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences, thus allowing you to visit various member-only parts of the Site without re-registering. Cookies are used by Star Search Casting, Inc. to measure activity on the Site and make improvements and updates based on which areas are popular and which are not. Star Search Casting, Inc. does not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except for personal information voluntarily provided by you (i.e., during membership registration or a contest), Star Search Casting, Inc. does not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any third parties whatsoever. 

You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers, which is standard in the Internet industry. Star Search Casting, Inc. does not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to Star Search Casting, Inc.'s privacy policies. 

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the Site, such as the member-only areas and shopping, contest and game areas, will not function properly if you do so. 

USE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED BY Star Search Casting, Inc., INC.   
Star Search Casting, Inc. uses both the personal and aggregated information we collect for multiple purposes. The information is used to improve the content of the Site, to customize the content and/or layout of the Site for each individual user and to notify users about updates to the Site or promotional offers or opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you. 

Star Search Casting, Inc. shares aggregated information with third parties for both advertising and promotional purposes. We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 

Star Search Casting, Inc. may also share information with consultants and affiliates for internal business purposes and may divulge personal information if such information is subpoenaed, or if Star Search Casting, Inc. believes that any user has committed unlawful acts, to acts that endanger the health or safety of another user or of the general public. In some situations, we will share your personal information, on a confidential basis, with third parties who perform a particular service on our behalf, such as sending e-mails. Also, Star Search Casting, Inc. may be sold or transferred to another entity. Should such an event occur, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 

In addition, in the event Star Search Casting, Inc. plans to post any personal information on the Site, Star Search Casting, Inc. will either notify you of this possibility when you provide the information and/or, if possible, when the information is posted. 

Occasionally, we may post the name of a user (for example a contest winner) on one of our sites. Star Search Casting, Inc. will notify you of this possibility when you provide your information or, if possible, will notify you when the information is posted. 

Star Search Casting, Inc. may use third party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our sites. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to our sites and to other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services of interest to you. In addition, Star Search Casting, Inc. may share Web site usage information about visitors to our sites with such company for the purpose of managing and targeting advertisements on our sites. For this purpose, we and our third-party advertising company note some of the pages you visit on our sites through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs). 

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

Other personal information you send to us at the website, however, including any email messages, will not be encrypted unless we advise you otherwise.
