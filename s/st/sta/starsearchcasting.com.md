## Our Commitment To Privacy

**January 1, 2004:**

**About Star Search Casting**  
Star Search Casting (SSC) is an online service that allows our members to set up unique personal profiles that can be linked together through networks of friends. SSC members can view each others' profiles, communicate with friends and meet new friends on the service, share photos, post blogs and comments, and describe their interests. To enrich our members' experience, we request and display some personal information to other members and visitors, which allows our users to identify each other and expand their network of friends. SSC members can change their profile information at any time and can control how other members and the service communicates with them.

This Agreement includes Star Search Casting's policy for acceptable use of the SSC Services and Content posted on the SSC Website, your rights, obligations and restrictions regarding your use of the SSC Services and Star Search Casting's Terms of Use.

**Information Collection and Use by Star Search Casting**  
To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. Star Search Casting collects user submitted information such as name, email address, and age to authenticate users and to send notifications to those users relating to the Star Search Casting service. Star Search Casting also collects other profile data including but not limited to: personal interests, gender, age, education and occupation in order to assist users in finding and communicating with each other.

Star Search Casting also logs non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from users and visitors to the site. This data is used to manage the website, track usage and improve the website services. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to members. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.

User Profile information including members' pictures and first names are displayed to viewers. Email addresses are used for the purposes of inviting new friends to join SSC, to add users to members' friends' networks, and to send notifications related to the service. User's email address is not shared or displayed. Users within a personal network communicate on Star Search Casting with each other through the Star Search Casting private message service, without disclosing their email addresses. Users' full names are never directly revealed to other members.

We may also use a user's email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding the service. Users may choose not to receive email of this type by changing their "notification" setting to "Do not send me notification emails" in the user "Account Settings"

From time to time, Star Search Casting or a partner, may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on SSC. Users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. We may transfer personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply.

**Invitations and Other Communications to Non-members**  
SSC members can invite friends to join the service by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system. Star Search Casting stores the email addresses that members provide so that the respondents may be added to the friend's list of the member sending the invitations, and also to send reminders of the invitations. Star Search Casting does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations, invitation reminders (up to three (3) per email address).

SSC members may also store email addresses of people they know in their internal SSC address book and may also choose to send invitations and other communications to those addresses.

**Use of Cookies**  
Star Search Casting uses cookies to store visitors' preferences and to record session information, for purposes including ensuring that visitors are not repeatedly offered the same advertisements and to customize newsletter, advertising, and Web page content based on browser type and user profile information.

This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Star Search Casting and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

**Security**  
Star Search Casting member accounts are secured by member-created passwords. SSC takes precautions to insure that member account information is kept private. We use reasonable measures to protect member information that is stored within our database, and we restrict access to member information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff. Please note that we cannot guarantee the security of member account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member information at any time.

If you purchase goods or services at the Site, you will be asked for credit card information, including your name, account number and expiration date; and Email Information. When you send us email messages, we may retain the content of your email messages, together with your email address and our response to you. You understand and agree that "perfect" security does not exist anywhere, including the Internet. When you send credit card information to us at the website, we use a technology called Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) to encrypt this information between your computer and our server. Other personal information you send to us at the website, however, including any email messages, will not be encrypted unless we advise you otherwise. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

**Sharing and Disclosure of Information Star Search Casting Collects**  
Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement, SSC will not disclose personal information to any third party unless we believe that disclosure is necessary: (1) to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process received by Star Search Casting, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (2) to enforce the Star Search Casting Terms of Use Agreement or to protect our rights; or (3) to protect the safety of members of the public and users of the service. SSC reserves the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale of SSC or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest.

**Our Commitment To Children’s Privacy**  
SSC encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children online, and to be fully familiar with the sites visited by their children. At various places on SSC, will ask whether users are under the age of 18, or 14, for example when requesting personal information from users, or SSC may ask for parental consent. However, while SSC requests this information or permission, SSC relies on users to be truthful in responding to these questions.

**Individuals Under 14**  
No information should be submitted or posted on the Site by users under the age of 14 years without the consent of their parent or guardian. Users under the age of 14 are generally asked not to participate in contests or other promotional opportunities.

**Changes in Our Privacy Policy**  
From time to time we may make changes to our privacy policy. If we make changes, we will post them on our site to make users aware of what the changes are so users will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and when we may disclose it. A User is bound by any minor changes to the policy when she or he uses the site after those changes have been posted. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify by posting a notice on our Web site.
