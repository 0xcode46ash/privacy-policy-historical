# Stansberry Privacy Policy

We take your privacy very seriously.

When you subscribe, your e-mail address is placed in a database and used to send your issues and occasional advertisements or special notices from the service or publication you subscribed to. We will not sell, rent, or otherwise share your e-mail address with anyone.

You can remove your address from our e-mailing list by following the instructions at the end of every e-mail we send.

Any e-mail you send to us is considered confidential unless you tell us otherwise. We will not add your name to our e-mail list without your permission. If your inquiry is about an order or subscription, our customer service staff will ask you to verify your identity by confirming information already in your record.

We will never ask you for personal information--your credit card number, for example--except when you place an order. At that time, we will provide a secure (SSL, encrypted) connection and require you to submit only the information needed to complete and fulfill your order. Only our authorized employees will have access to this information. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone, nor share it in any other way, unless required to by a law enforcement agency that takes the proper steps to require it. Please note that "personal information" does not include your mailing address. See Mailing Address, below.

When you give us your mailing address, we will use this information to fulfill your order or subscription and to send you information on other products that may suit your interests. If you don't want us to send you this other information, please contact our customer service department:
