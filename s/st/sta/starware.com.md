Version 08/26/2004

At Starware we're passionate about making great software and we work hard at providing valuable products at no cost to our users.  No cost?  How do we pay the bills? 

Starware's principle revenue is earned through its search tools.  Sites pay to get certain placement within key word search results.  If users find those results attractive and click through to the page, the advertiser pays the search partner for the click.  This is the way it works at Google and Yahoo and it's the way it works with starware.com.

The big guys get their search traffic from owning powerful brands.  We get ours by building great downloadable products and search tools that makes your online experience a little better.  If we build useful products that aren't polluted with annoying advertising, you'll keep them installed and we'll make money to fund more great products.

Most of our searches are generated through the use of our toolbar.  Internet Explorer also has a number of features that direct the user to search results.  The default setting displays these results using MSN.  If you choose to make Starware your default search provider on install, these search results will be delivered by us.

Over time we will find new innovative and useful features that generate revenue through search and advertising.  These products will be unobtrusive and always give you the ability to turn the feature off if you choose.

Policy Overview

We want you to feel comfortable downloading and using our products. We understand that your trust in us depends on us respecting your privacy and being careful about safeguarding any information that you provide us. 

We have put in place guidelines-detailed below-to demonstrate that we are acting in ways that we (as longtime citizens of the Internet ourselves) expect to be treated when we download software on the Internet. 

Practices

  * Our software is installed only with the user's permission.  We do not bundle our software with partners that install without obtaining user permission.
  * We're proud of our software and our business and we tell you what we do.
  * We allow you to disable advertising features that you feel are not valuable.
  * We make it easy for you to uninstall our software through the standard Add/Remove interface.  No tricks.  Try it out.  If you don't like it, uninstall it.
  * We put our brand on our products and provide you with links to our customer service department.



Data collection 

We need to collect some data to know how many users we have, how our products are performing and how our business is doing.   We do not exploit our users nor do we collect any data that allows us or anyone else to personally identify a user.

  * We do not send or collect any information that can personally identify a user.
  * We do collect information that is already available to every website you visit.  Examples include browser version, language and other browser and connection information. 
  * We use a unique id in order to know how many people use our products. This id is not personally identifying in any way; it is a completely random number.  
  * We do send a log once per day that tells us how many users are installed.
  * We do collect data at our search and travel sites.  This is needed to monitor our business performance.  This data does not contain any personally identifying information.
  * We do not and will not sell or distribute any data collected from the user. 
  * We do share aggregated information with others. Examples of this include how many users clicked on a particular paid listing in a search result. 
  * We do take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data **.**



Cookies 

  * We may use cookies to determine if you are a new or existing user.
  * Our cookies contain no personally identifying information.
  * You may disable the use of cookies through Internet Explorer's settings.



Updating 

  * Our product is dynamic in much the same way as a web page.  Some files reside on the local machine, some reside on our servers.  Bug fixes and new features may be added to the product without notice.
  *  Any new product that requires us to modify our privacy policy will make such requirements known to the user and allow the user to block the data or disable the product.



Links 

  * The sites displayed as search results or linked to by us are developed by people over whom we exercises no authority. These other sites may place their own cookies on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information without our knowledge or control. 



Disabling

  * You may disable specific features through our Preference settings.  This allows you to turn off features you don't like and keep the ones you do.
  * Uninstall is simple.  Go to your Start Menu>Control Panel>Add/Remove Programs. When you have the Add/Remove Control Panel open, scroll down the list of installed programs until you see "Starware."  Select it by clicking on it and then click "Change/Remove."  It should remove the program all together.  If you still see the toolbar on your desktop, or any other starware.com files remaining on your hard drive, please contact us at [Customer Support](http://as.starware.com/dp/feedback?src_id=10003&client_id=site&version=site). 



Changes to this Policy

  * Please note this Privacy Policy may change in the future. Our current privacy policy will always be made available at this page. The policy version will be noted at the top of the page and previous versions will be made available to review upon request.
  * If you have any additional questions, or would like to suggest improvements to this policy, please contact our privacy officer at chrisp @ starware.net.
