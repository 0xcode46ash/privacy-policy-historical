| **Privacy Policy** | **Back to Top**    
  
|   
As an Internet pioneer, we understand the power that the Internet holds for changing your life and making things easier for you. These benefits are at risk if people are concerned about their personal privacy. We are committed to providing you with an Internet experience that respects and protects your personal privacy choices and concerns. 

Our privacy policy and practices are detailed below. Please read them thoroughly. We make three pledges to you: 

  * We will not release personally identifiable information about you without your permission (except as needed to provide to you the services you have expressly requested). See "third party relationships" below. 
  * You can manage and control the information that you have voluntarily provided to us. 
  * You can tell us what your privacy questions and concerns are so that we can respond. 

We constantly improve the tools you can use to manage the data that you provide to us. Please refer to this page from time to time to see these new features.   
  
| **Helpful Definitions** | **Back to Top**    
  
|   
Personally identifiable information is information, such as your name, birth date, e-mail address or mailing address, that can be used to uniquely identify you. 

Anonymous information is not personally identifiable information. Anonymous information is information about how you use our site (such as sites you visit and searches you do). Anonymous information also includes the domain names and/or I.P. addresses (as explained below) of internet browsers that visit our site, the time of day the site was visited, and other non-personal information. Anonymous information is information that is not tied to any person who is not registered as an AltaVista member, but helps us know what our users do (for example, the average stay on our site lasts over 10 minutes). 

The next sections tell how and when we collect anonymous information and personally identifiable information from you.

_Registration_

You can visit our site and use many of our services without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself to us. **It is only when you register to become an AltaVista member that will you be asked to provide us with personally identifiable information**. 

Most of our services do not require any form of customer registration, but we do require registration for some services, such as e-mail. When you register with us, you need to complete certain fields (some are required and some are optional), as well as pick a user name and password. For example, we ask for information so we can contact you (like your first and last name, email address, and postal code). We use this information in several ways: 

  * to tell you about new features and services available on our site 
  * to display advertisements that closely match your interests 
  * to provide a first and last name on messages you sent from your AltaVista email account 
  * to share your information with select third parties who work with us, only if you give us permission (as we explain below) 

  
  
  
| **Disclosure of Your Identity** | **Back to Top**    
  
|   
From time to time we receive requests to disclose the identities of our users. We do not disclose the identities of our users unless we are legally required to do so. 

If a governmental agency, or a law enforcement agency, requests information in relation to the identities of our user, we will comply with the request. If we receive a request by a third party that is not a governmental agency (for example, a request in connection with civil litigation), we will contact the user whose identity has been requested using the contact information the user provided during the registration process. We will wait 10 days after notifying the user before deciding whether to comply with the request by disclosing the identity of the user, unless the request requires us to disclose this information before then. If we cannot wait 10 days because of the deadline in the request, we will let the user know the deadline included in the request when we provide notice that we received it.   
  
  
| **Anonymous Information** | **Back to Top**    
  
|   
We collect anonymous information when people use our site, even if they have not registered with us. We use this information to personalise your experience on our site, to show you more relevant advertising messages, and to improve our services in general. We are unable to combine this anonymous information with personal information about you to target advertising messages aimed at you as an individual. We share this anonymous information with some other companies, such as Engage Technologies (a sister company of AltaVista), so you can see more relevant advertising messages. Engage Technologies analyses anonymous information that we collect during your visit to AltaVista and other sites to understand what advertising messages you would like. Engage Technologies never collects or uses any of your personally identifiable information. To learn more about Engage Technologies and your rights with respect to the information Engage may gather, [click here](http://www.engage.com/). 

Our advertising is sold and served by DoubleClick. See the section below for more information on DoubleClick. As part of the advertising process, we give to DoubleClick some information, like type of Web page, location on the site, and search queries, so that DoubleClick can serve a relevant ad to you. For instance, if you do a search for "sports", DoubleClick may serve sports-related advertisements. DoubleClick offers you a "blank cookie" to prevent any of this data from being stored or linked to any other information. To find out more about this procedure, please [click here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/opt-out.asp?asp_object_1=&). 

We will not share any anonymous information about your use of our site with third parties if we know that this information will be linked with your personally identifiable information obtained from another source, unless you have given us permission to do this.   
  
  
| **Cookies** | **Back to Top**    
  
|   
_How They Are Used_

A "cookie" is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not damage your computer. We use cookies to help us provide personal services and to allow you to sign-in to our site without having to enter your name and password each time. For example, we can store your postcode in a cookie so we can show you local weather each time you visit our site. Cookies also make web surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you're on our site. Cookies may also be used by other companies on co-branded Web pages, as explained below in "third party relationships." 

You can decide if you want to accept cookies by changing the settings on your computer. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you do not accept cookies, then some of our features will not work as we intended them to work. 

[DoubleClick](http://www.doubleclick.net/) places a cookie on your computer when you first view an advertisement served by them (this could happen while you are on our site or another site where DoubleClick serves ads). DoubleClick uses this cookie to control the sequence of ads you see and to make sure you don't see the same ad too many times. Please [click here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/default.asp?asp_object_1=&) for more information. DoubleClick also serves advertisements for other online companies and can track the ad effectiveness on the web sites of those other online companies through the use of this same DoubleClick cookie. We cannot control or remove these DoubleClick cookies. If you do not want DoubleClick to have access to this information, DoubleClick offers you a "blank cookie" to prevent any data from being stored. For more information, [click here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/opt-out.asp?asp_object_1=&). 

In addition, if you are concerned about how DoubleClick may use the information it gathers on our site, please see [www.doubleclick.net](http://www.doubleclick.net/), which sets forth its privacy policy and full disclosure on the use of cookies. Feel free to contact DoubleClick at [info@doubleclick.net](mailto:info@doubleclick.net) if you have more questions or want more information. 

_Special Cookies if You Have Opted-Out_

If you do not allow us to disclose your personal information when you register with us or if you request a blank cookie, as explained above, we will honour your request by delivering a special cookie to your Internet browser. 

**REMEMBER** : Because your special cookie relates only to your Internet browser, when you request a blank cookie, it will last only as long as your computer's cookie file is maintained. If you switch to a new computer, or change or upgrade your browser, or clean out your computer's cookie file, you will need to request a blank cookie again. 

You can also ask to have all information related to your registration removed by sending an email to [legal-support-uk@av.com](mailto:legal-support-uk@av.com).   
  
  
| **Special Types of Information** | **Back to Top**    
  
|   
We will not share with third parties any personally identifiable information about you that is of a medical, ethnic, financial or sexual nature. Anonymous data in these special categories will be passed to Engage, as explained above, and to DoubleClick to return relevant ads. To better protect you, DoubleClick offers you a "blank cookie" to prevent any of this data from being stored or linked to any other information. To find out more, [click here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/opt-out.asp?asp_object_1=&).   
   
  
| **Children** | **Back to Top**    
  
|   
We will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information on users under the age of 13 without parental consent. Parents have the ability to control what personal information about their child may be disclosed to third parties, and we believe that this is just the way things should be.   
   
  
| **Use of I.P. Addresses** | **Back to Top**    
  
|   
An Internet protocol (I.P.) address is a set of numbers that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you log on to your internet service provider or through your company's local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN). Web servers, the powerful computers that provide web pages for viewing, automatically identify your computer by the IP address assigned to it during your session online. 

We may collect I.P. addresses for some purposes (for example, to report anonymous user information to our advertisers and to audit the use of our site). We do not link a user's I.P. address to a person's personal information, which means we will have a record of each user's session but the user remains anonymous to us. 

**PLEASE NOTE** : Under certain circumstances, I.P. addresses and/or domain names may be linked to personally identifiable information, when this information is stored in databases managed by Internet registrars or registries such as [Network Solutions](http://www.networksolutions.com/) or [ARIN](http://www.arin.net/).   
  
  
| **Third-Party Relationship** | **Back to Top**    
  
|   
We have relationships with many media and services companies throughout the world. You can recognise these sites by the joint branding of AltaVista and these companies. For example, if you see a logo in the upper-right corner of the page that often says 'Powered by ______', you will know you are on a co-branded Web page. If you ever have any questions about whether certain information, content or services pertain to us, or are "powered by" one of our partners, please contact us at [legal-support-uk@av.com](mailto:legal-support-uk@av.com). 

When you give us registration information on certain co-branded Web pages or for services provided in conjunction with third party partners, we want to be clear that some data you give us is shared with these partners. For instance, certain information information is shared with Critical Path (such as your user ID), our free email services provider. You should make every effort to read the privacy policies of these third parties and decide whether or not to continue using the services based upon the privacy policies posted. We have contracted with those third parties to ensure that they will not use your personal information for a particular purpose without your consent or unless it is necessary to fulfill a request you are making of that third party. If you are concerned about a third party's use of your personal details please email us at [legal-support-uk@av.com](mailto:legal-support-uk@av.com) and we will address your request with the appropriate company. **No third-party sites are covered by our Privacy Policy, but we will make every effort to ensure that third party sites comply with our Privacy Policy**.   
  
  
| **Security** | **Back to Top**    
  
|   
We operate secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection. We have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your user data under our control. 

Only certain employees have access to the information you provide us. For example, we impose strict rules on our employees who have access either to the databases that store user information or to the servers that host our services. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur, we try to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.
