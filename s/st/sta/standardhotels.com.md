  *  **Using cookies** : Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using. They allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Services, pages visited, your location, language preferences and anonymous traffic data. We and our service providers use the information for such purposes as security, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, to personalize your experience, to understand how the Services are used, to improve the Services and to assist us with resolving questions regarding them. Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the Services. We may also use cookies to track responses to our online advertisements. We do not track your activities when you are on third-party websites, but we or our service providers may track your actions with respect to our ads placed on third-party websites. We do not honor browser do-not-track signals at this time.



If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site. You may also wish to refer to <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html>. If, however, you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services.
