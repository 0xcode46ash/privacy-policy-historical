**Information Collected and How it is Used**  
If you do nothing during your visit to Access Washington but browse or download information, we automatically collect and store the following information about your visit: 

  1. The Internet Protocol Address and domain name used but not the email address. The Internet Protocol address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet service provider or directly to your computer. We use the Internet Protocol Address to direct Internet traffic to you; 
  2. The type of browser and operating system you used; 
  3. The date and time you visited this site; 
  4. The Web pages or services you accessed at this site; and 
  5. The Web site you visited prior to coming to this Web site.



The information we automatically collect or store is used to improve the content of our Web services and to help us understand how people are using our services. Access Washington staff analyzes our Web site logs to continually improve the value of the materials available on our site. Our Web site logs are not personally identifiable, and we make no attempt to link them with the individuals that browse Access Washington. 

If during your visit to Access Washington you participate in a survey, register or participate in a listserv, or send an email, the following additional information will be collected: 

  1. The email address and contents of the email; 
  2. Information provided to register or shared during your participation in a listserv and

**Personal Information and Choice **  
"Personal information" is information about a natural person that is readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal information includes such things as an individual's name, address, and phone number. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not considered personal information. 

We collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily participate in an activity that asks for information (e.g. sending an email, registering or participating in a listserv or participating in a survey). If you choose not to participate in these activities, your choice will in no way affect your ability to use any other feature of Access Washington. 

If personal information is requested on the Web site or volunteered by the user, state law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information is a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by federal or state law. 

Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information requested from or volunteered by children on-line or by email will be treated the same as information given by an adult, and may be subject to public access.

**Public Disclosure**  
In the State of Washington, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by state government. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to access public records that serve various needs including the privacy of individuals. Exceptions are provided by both state and federal laws. 

All information collected at this site becomes public records that may be subject to inspection and copying by the public, unless an exemption in law exists. [RCW 42.17. 260(1)](http://search.leg.wa.gov/wslrcw/RCW%20%2042%20%20TITLE/RCW%20%2042%20.%2017%20%20CHAPTER/RCW%20%2042%20.%2017%20.260.htm) states that 

Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available for public inspection and copying all public records, unless the record falls within the specific exemptions of subsection (6) of this section _[RCW 42.17.260(6)]_ , RCW 42.17.310, 42.17.315, or other statute which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records. To the extent required to prevent an unreasonable invasion of personal privacy interests protected by RCW 42.17.310 and 42.17.315, an agency shall delete identifying details in a manner consistent with RCW 42.17.310 and 42.17.315 when it makes available or publishes any public record; however, in each case, the justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in writing.

In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Notice and the Public Records Act or other law governing the disclosure of records, the Public Records Act or other applicable law will control.
