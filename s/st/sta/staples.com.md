**Privacy and Security @ Staples.com**

At Staples.com, we have taken the following steps to ensure that your information is secure and your privacy is respected:

  * Utilizing SSL Technology 
  * Hosting Our Site on Secure Servers 
  * Allowing our guests to opt out of any online or traditional telemarketing efforts 



We collect information to make decisions about how to best meet the needs of our customers and to notify them of offers that may be of interest. We firmly believe it's your right to know what information we collect, how we use it and what your options are. Below is more detailed information about online security, information collection and use, and how to contact us. 

**Is My Credit Card Safe?**  


At Staples.com, whenever you provide any personal information (e.g. when making a purchase, requesting a catalog, completing an email form), we make sure that it is encrypted so that no one else can read it while it is being transmitted over the Internet. At this time, all information (such as your name and address) is safely stored behind a firewall. We store this type of information so that you do not have to reenter it each time you make a purchase or log in. 

**Is My Personal Information Safe?**  


We collect: 

  * domain names of visitors to our Web site 
  * email addresses of those who email us or register with us 
  * information on how many visits each page receives 
  * user-specific information on what pages consumers visit 
  * information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations 



We collect this information in order to study how we can create the best shopping experience for our customers. By looking at usage patterns, we know which areas need expansion and which areas are not meeting our customers needs. We also collect information to customize our pages for individual visitors who opt to personalize our site, notify consumers about updates to our Web site, and contact consumers for marketing purposes.
