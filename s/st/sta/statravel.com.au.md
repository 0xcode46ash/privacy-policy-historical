# Privacy policy of STA Travel Australia and New Zealand | STA Travel | Privacy policy

**STA Travel Pty Ltd** (ABN 34 004 801 512) trading as STA Travel, ATAS Accreditation AO10872 and its related entities (referred to as **STA Travel** , **we** , **us** or our) endeavours to protect the privacy of all our travellers whether you visit one of our branches or our Internet site. 

We have developed this privacy policy to inform you what personal information we may collect from or about you, what this information will be used for, with whom such information will be shared and the security procedures we have implemented to protect your privacy.

## What information we collect

When you consult us in one of our branches or over the telephone, or provide your details online, we will collect personal information that is relevant to you and your travel arrangements. This includes providing necessary information to airlines, tour companies, car hire agencies, hotels or insurance providers to fulfill your travel arrangements. By consulting us and providing your personal information to make a booking, or by making a booking, you consent to STA Travel using any personal information for the purpose of making and completing travel arrangements on your behalf.

Promotions that run on our site may be sponsored by companies other than STA Travel, or may be co-sponsored. Some or all data collected during a promotion (including personal information) may be shared with the co-sponsor(s). If data collected is to be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don't want your data to be shared.

When completing an on line job application for a Branch Sales Manager or Travel Adviser, it requires you to complete mandatory fields and provide personal information. STA Travel recognises that the personal information related to your application is highly personal and sensitive. The information will be only used for this purpose. STA Travel may pass your application onto a third party Recruitment Company for initial interviewing. Applications are kept on file for a period of six months.

When you visit the STA Travel web site, we may collect and store information about your visit on an anonymous, aggregate basis. This information may include the time and length of your visit, the pages you looked at on our site and the site you visited just before coming to ours. We may also record the name of your Internet service provider. We only use this information only to measure site activity and to develop ideas for improving our site.

## Who is collecting your information

When you are on the site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with STA Travel only except when explained in this privacy policy.

## With whom such information will be shared

When you make travel arrangements with STA Travel and provide information (including personal information) about yourself, we use this information to complete your travel arrangements and to provide you with promotional information. This may include sharing your personal information with our related entities, and to third parties that provide products and services to us or through us. Some or all of the data collected during a promotion may be shared with the co-sponsor(s). Job application information may be supplied to a third party, recruitment company for initial interviewing.

STA Travel may also disclose the personal information that we collect about you when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact, investigate and raise concerns about, or bring legal action against, persons or entities who may be causing (or who may in future cause) injury to you, to us or to others. 

We may also disclose your personal information if required by law or otherwise permitted by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) ( **Privacy Act** ) or other relevant laws in Australia which relate to the protection of personal information, including any future amendments to those laws ( **Privacy Laws** ). To avoid doubt, we may disclose your personal information if permitted by the National Privacy Principles under the Privacy Act and any amendments to them (including if they are replaced by the Australian Privacy Principles).

We may also transfer your personal information to persons outside of Australia in accordance with this privacy policy (including by contacting overseas airlines, tour companies, car hire agencies, hotels or insurance providers) if your travel arrangements involve overseas travel. In this case, we may transfer your personal information to relevant persons based or operating in the country/countries in which you are travelling or planning to travel. We may also transfer your personal information to our ultimate parent company (Diethelm Keller Ltd) in Switzerland in accordance with this privacy policy.
