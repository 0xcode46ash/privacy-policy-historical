## Privacy Policy & Terms of Use

Protecting your privacy is important to us. We hope the following statement will help you understand how Stark Bros collects, uses and safeguards the personal information you provide to us on our site.

### How does Stark Bro's protect my information online?

We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology with verified information though DigiCert to protect your online order information as it is transmitted over the Internet. We also utilize advanced firewall technology to protect our equipment from online attacks.

Some versions of browsers and firewalls do not permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use at starkbros.com. To check the security of your Internet connection, look at your browser window after accessing our website, prior to entering your credit card information. An unbroken key icon or a closed lock icon will indicate that SSL is active. You can also double-check the security by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http:" to "https:".

If your browser or firewall does not support SSL, you will not be able to connect to the server. This also means you will not be able to mistakenly place an order through an unsecured connection.
