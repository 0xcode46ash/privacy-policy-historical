# Privacy Statement - Starwood Vacation Network

Starwood Vacation Ownership, Inc., its subsidiary companies, and managed owners’ associations (together “SVO”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through compliance with this Online Privacy Statement (“Policy”). This Policy describes the type of information SVO may collect from you or that you may provide when you visit any website owned or operated by SVO. The mission of SVO is to consistently exceed our visitors’ expectations in terms of the products and services we provide to our business and leisure travelers. SVO collects information about our visitors (both offline and online) so that we can provide an experience that is tailored to their preferences. Since the privacy of our visitors is of paramount importance to SVO, we wish to protect it and maintain the trust of our visitors while collecting the information necessary to do this. SVO is fully committed to providing information about the collection and use of personal information furnished by, or from, visitors while using our websites, products and services. We offer visitors the choice to decline (opt out) participation in certain services and promotional benefits provided by SVO and/or our carefully selected third parties. Please read this Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is to not use our websites. By accessing or using our websites, you agree to this Policy. This Policy may change from time to time. Your continued use of the websites after we make changes is deemed acceptance of those changes, so please check the Policy periodically for updates.

Note that the _Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc._ (“Starwood”) Privacy Statement governs the data collection and use in relation to Starwood operated websites and properties.

The following is an explanation of the information collected by SVO, its use, and why the use of this information will benefit our visitors’ experience.

### YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

California Civil Code Section 1798.83, provides certain privacy rights to individual customers who are California residents. If you are a California resident and have provided personal information to SVO, you may request information about our disclosures of certain categories of personal information to third parties, if such disclosures were for the direct marketing purposes of the recipient of that information. Because your privacy is important to us, SVO does not share your personal information with unaffiliated third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, except as stated below. SVO does share customer information among its subsidiary companies for the purpose of marketing the various SVO resorts, vacation products and services, and shares certain information about its vacation ownership interest owners with the external vacation exchange companies (Interval International and/or Resort Condominiums International) that are affiliated with the SVO resorts.

### INFORMATION COLLECTED ON OUR WEBSITES

The websites owned or controlled by SVO may ask for and collect personal information in order to provide a customized experience. The personal information we collect on or through our websites may include information that you provide by filling in forms on our websites, such as, name, postal address, e-mail address, and telephone number. Visitors are given notice of this request and they have the ability to choose the information they wish to share with us. Visitors will be informed about how SVO may use such information, including whether it will be shared with carefully selected third parties. In most cases, the information a visitor provides is added to our database in order for us to provide personally tailored messages which are delivered online and offline.

SVO may also collect information using automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment and browsing activities and patterns. Our automatic data collection activities are further described in the Cookies and Invisible Pixels section of this Policy below.

SVO may contract with third-party service providers to deliver services and customer solutions. Service providers, which may change or be added from time to time, are required to keep confidential the information received on behalf of SVO and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for SVO. Situations in which SVO may disclose your information to others include:

  * When we have received your consent to do so;
  * In situations where sharing or disclosing your information is required in order to offer you products or services you requested (e.g., a vacation package);
  * When companies or services providers that perform business activities on behalf of SVO require such information (e.g., credit card processing, customer support services, market research administration or database management services);
  * When a hotel or other property leaves the Starwood system and access to your personal information is necessary to facilitate business operations or meet contractual obligations;
  * In the event SVO is merged or acquired by another company;
  * To comply with legal or regulatory requirements or obligations in accordance with applicable law, a court order or a subpoena, to enforce the right of a lender, owners’ association, or foreclose on a property interest; and
  * In case of emergency such as to safeguard the life, health, or property of an individual.



If information is shared as mentioned above, we seek to limit the scope of information that is furnished to the amount necessary for the performance of the specific function. Unless otherwise precluded by legal process, we require third parties to protect your personal information and abide by applicable privacy laws and regulations.

If you are accessing the Policy through a website intended for owners of SVO products, such as MyStarCentral.com or StRegisResidenceClub.com (“Owner Only Websites”), please know that it is necessary for us to collect certain personal information to present you with your specific ownership information and allow you to perform various activities within these websites. If you do not wish to share your information, please do not register on any of the Owner Only Websites.

### COOKIES AND INVISIBLE PIXELS

The websites may collect personal information through behavioral tracking. As you navigate through and interact with our websites, SVO, its vendors, and marketing partners, may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns by using cookies, invisible pixels, and web beacons. These help us deliver a better and more personalized service, including by enabling us to estimate our audience size and usage patterns; store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our websites according to your individual interests; and speed up your searches.

**_Web Beacons and Invisible Pixels._** SVO uses invisible pixels and web beacons to count how many people visit certain web pages. Information collected from invisible pixels and web beacons is used and reported in the aggregate. SVO may use this information to improve marketing programs and content.

**_Cookies._** Cookies are used to:

  * Remember your user name and password for future visits so log-in is easier and faster;
  * Ensure you are provided with the appropriate frames and content;
  * Ensure you obtain all requested information; and
  * Help us deliver communications that are relevant and responsive to your interests and location.



SVO cookies assign your computer or other device with a unique identifier, which in turn, becomes your identification card whenever you return to a SVO or Starwood website. Cookies are small data files that most websites store, access, and maintain on the hard drive of your computer. Most browsers now automatically accept cookies by default but they can be set so that all or some cookies are rejected automatically or are accepted or rejected on a case-by-case basis at the user’s option.

Below we explain the different types of cookies that may be used on our websites. For a full list of the cookies we employ please see the section labeled Cookie Choices.

  * _Essential Cookies._ Essential cookies are necessary for our websites to work, and to enable you to navigate it and use its services and features. As disabling these cookies would make the services and features unavailable, we are not required to provide you with an opt-out consent mechanism.
  * _Customization Cookies._ Customization or preference cookies store your choices and preferences allowing us to remember language or other local settings and to customize our websites accordingly.
  * _Analytics Cookies._ Analytics cookies collect information about your use of SVO websites and enable us to identify problems, determine the efficacy of our advertising, and understand how aggregate traffic moves on and to our websites.
  * _Advertising Cookies._ Advertising cookies allow us to show you the most relevant products, offers, advertisements and personalized content and help us provide you with an online experience that’s tailored to your needs.



We may also work with vendors and marketing partners to help deliver advertisements and personalized content that we believe will be of interest to you. These vendors and other partners include advertisers, advertising agencies, advertising networks, audience segment providers, data exchanges, analytics providers, and other similar providers. Please [click here](http://www.starwoodhotels.com/promotions/promo_landing.html?category=VNAGLS) for a current list of the agencies and providers with which we work. These partners and vendors use cookies and web beacons to collect information about your online activity (e.g., the sites and pages you have visited at Starwood and other third party websites) in order to help SVO and third party advertisers deliver personalized content and advertising to you while you are on SVO or other websites. For example, if you go to an SVO website to look at one of our properties or to book a hotel room, you may later see an advertisement from us when you visit another website. We may also engage one of these vendors to deliver our advertisements to consumers whose online behaviors on websites other than the SVO websites indicate that they may be interested in travel. In other instances, we engage in special arrangements with certain advertisers with which we think our website visitors would have an interest. We allow these advertisers to deliver co-branded messages (e.g., SVO and the advertiser) directly to consumers who have visited our websites. These types of co-branded advertisements may appear on SVO or on third party websites. In general, you can opt out of our vendors’ use of cookies to tailor personalized content or advertising to you by visiting:

[http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and http://www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp%20and%20http://www.aboutads.info/choices).

We also work with vendors to deliver our advertisements directly to those who are traveling or about to travel. For example, when you print your boarding pass online, one of our vendors may drop a cookie on your computer, identifying your computer with a unique identifier and a code indicating your destination. We use this vendor to deliver advertisements to you indicating our available properties in the destination indicated on your boarding pass.

**_Cookie Choices_**

You can disable cookies by setting your preferences at any time in the **Cookie Consent Tool** available at the small grey box on the bottom left-hand side corner on our website.

Depending upon the type of browser you are using, you may be able to configure your browser so that: (i) you are prompted to accept or reject cookies on an individual basis or (ii) you may be able to prevent your browser from accepting any cookies at all.

Occasionally, information that a visitor requests to be removed will be retained in certain files in order to properly resolve disputes or to troubleshoot problems.
