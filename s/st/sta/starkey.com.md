Statement of Privacy
Starkey Laboratories is committed to protecting your privacy. Protecting our visitors’
confidential information is part of the fabric of our daily operations. You can travel
through most of our site without giving us any information about yourself. But
sometimes we do need information to provide information that you request, and this
statement of privacy explains data collection and use in those situations. This privacy
statement explains data collection and use practices; it does not apply to other online
or offline Starkey, Starkey-related or Starkey sponsored sites, products or services.

Collecting your Personal Information
We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows
us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you are requesting
information or signing up for a special promotion. Personal information collected by
Starkey often is limited to e-mail address and country or location, but may include
other information when needed to provide a service you requested or to improve the
quality of this website.
We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf. We
will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service,
and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
Starkey may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the
good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law
or comply with legal process served on the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or
property of Starkey, or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of
customers of Starkey, its website, or the public.
Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other
country in which Starkey or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities,
