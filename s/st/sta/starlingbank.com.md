5.1. We process data and store it on servers managed by our hosting provider. Those servers are located across a number of secure data centres in the European Economic Area (EEA). Our server environment is highly secure, and there is very limited personnel access. Any data will be encrypted “at rest” (in other words, on being stored).

5.2. We try to ensure that we do not send data outside the EEA. However, this is not possible in all cases:

5.2.1. in relation to a very small number of our suppliers, the data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the EEA as well as processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for them. However, by submitting your personal data, you consent to this transfer, storing or processing. We will ensure that suitable safeguards are in place before personal information is transferred outside the EEA and we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy;

5.2.2. also, if you are outside the EEA and make payments or send messages or you are in the EEA and make payments or send messages outside of the EEA we may process payments through other institutions and payment systems. They may have to process and store data about you in connection with their own regulations and the standards to which they adhere may not be as stringent as those in the EEA.

5.3. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

5.4. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet can never be 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to us and so any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

5.5. Generally, we will store your data for five years. In certain circumstances, such as regulatory requirements, we may have to store this for a longer period.

Please check these policies before you submit any personal data via these links or destinations.

 **7\. ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND UPDATING YOUR DATA**

7.2. If you wish to update information about you which is inaccurate or incorrect, we will try to give you the way to do so as quickly and easily as possible.
