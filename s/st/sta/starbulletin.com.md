# StarBulletin.com Privacy Policy - About - Starbulletin.com

#### Privacy

The information that StarBulletin.com collects about visitors while they are using the Service falls into two general categories: 

1\. Information You Provide to Us. StarBulletin.com may collect and store information, personal or otherwise, that you voluntarily supply either while on the StarBulletin.com Web site or in responding, via e-mail to a feature provided on the StarBulletin.com Web site. Some examples of this type of information include: demographic information that you electronically submit when you sign up for access to certain features on the Service, information (such as your name or e-mail address) that you electronically submit when you register for surveys, sweepstakes or contests on the StarBulletin.com Web site, information that you post on message boards on the StarBulletin.com Web site, and information contained in search requests or questions that you submit to the StarBulletin.com Web site. If you decline to supply or provide StarBulletin.com with certain information while using the Service, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through the Service. 

2\. Information that is Automatically Collected. StarBulletin.com also collects and stores information that is generated automatically as you navigate through the StarBulletin.com Web site. For example, to enhance your experience on the StarBulletin.com Web site, StarBulletin.com uses a standard feature found in browser software called a “cookie.” Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the StarBulletin.com site, cookies help us track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the StarBulletin.com site where you have entered preference information before. StarBulletin.com also uses web beacons (also known as “single-pixel GIFs") to access cookies and to count users who visit the StarBulletin.com site or open StarBulletin.com’s HTML-formatted email messages. Another example of information that StarBulletin.com automatically collects as you navigate the StarBulletin.com site is information about your computer’s connection to the Internet. This information allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our Web pages to you and to measure traffic on the StarBulletin.com site. 

#### How is the Information Used?

StarBulletin.com uses the information it collects from you while you are using the Service in a variety of ways, including, using the information to customize features and advertising that appear on the StarBulletin.com Web site. In addition, we may also provide third parties with information about our visitors for a variety of reasons and purposes. For example, we may provide our advertisers with information about our visitors that will better target ads to specific types of visitors. 

Therefore, StarBulletin.com reserves the right to use and to disclose to third parties all of the information that StarBulletin.com collects online about you and other visitors in any way and for any purpose, with one important exception. StarBulletin.com will not use the information that it collects online from you while you are using the Service, nor will StarBulletin.com authorize third parties to use such information to mail or e-mail promotional offers directly to you unless you have specifically informed StarBulletin.com that you would like to receive promotional offers from StarBulletin.com and from third parties. If you choose to receive these promotional offers, then your information may be used for direct mail or e-mail marketing. You may view or update your preference to receive these promotional offers by visiting StarBulletin.com. 

Please also keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online — for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas — that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides StarBulletin.com. StarBulletin.com cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third party use of information that you disclose online. 

The StarBulletin.com Web site includes links to other Web sites, and provides access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control. When you access another Web site or purchase products or services or conduct other transactions through the Service, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such products or services. 

We also make some content, products and services available through our Service through cooperative relationships with third party providers, where the brands of our provider partner appear prominently on StarBulletin.com. We may share with our provider partner any information you provide, or that is collected, in the course of visiting any pages that are made available in cooperation with our provider partner. In some cases, the provider partner may collect information from you directly; in which cases the privacy policy of the provider partner may apply to the provider partner’s use of your information. The privacy policy of our provider partners may differ from ours. If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of one of our provider partners, you should contact the provider directly for more information. 

Be aware that StarBulletin.com may occasionally release information about visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our Terms of Service agreement, or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our site, the public, or StarBulletin.com. 

Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that StarBulletin.com, some or all of our assets, or our site is acquired by another company, information on our visitors may be among the transferred assets. 

#### Children’s Privacy Statement for StarBulletin.com

If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of thirteen, we will delete such information from our records. If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen.
