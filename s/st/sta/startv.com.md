# STAR - Privacy Policy

|  | 

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS WEB SITE.

Thank you for visiting our website and for taking an interest in our services and products. STAR would like to safeguard the information you provide to us about yourself and inform you of options available to you when using our website and related services. Please read the following policy to understand how personal information you provide us will be used. As this policy may be modified from time to time, please check back periodically.

Generally, we will use the personal data which you have provided to us for the purposes of fulfilling your application for any of our services and products, credit checks in the case of applications, and for understanding how we can improve our services to you. Where appropriate, we may also use the information for internal research on our users demographics, interests and behavior, for providing you with the latest scoop on our channels and exciting special offers, or for direct marketing purposes where we think you may be interested in the products and services of some of our affiliates or third parties.

For these purposes, STAR may supply your information to our associated companies and/or to selected third parties. Your right to choose is important to us though, so, if you do not wish to receive information about other products, services and promotions from STAR or other parties, you can always contact our Privacy Compliance Manager at privacy@startv.com. 

If at anytime you wish to request correction and/or update of the information you have provided to us, you may contact our Privacy Compliance Manager. A reasonable administration fee may be charged for providing you with access to the personal data in order for us to process such correction request.

STAR does not currently use "cookies" to store or track information about you. If and when we do, you will be informed via this policy.

Some of STAR's services may be offered in conjunction with partner companies. In order to provide such co-branded services to you, it may be necessary for us to share your personal information with our partner companies. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service.

Promotions that run on STAR's website may be sponsored by companies other than STAR or may be co-sponsored by the STAR and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you do not want your data to be shared.

Web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The data protection practices of those web sites linked to STAR are not covered by this policy statement. You are advised to check the data protection policies of these third party websites yourself before using those sites.

STAR may also disclose your information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) STAR's rights or property, other STAR users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. STAR may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

Unfortunately, no data transmissions over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, STAR cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us via the internet, and you do so at your own risk. Once we have received your transmission, we will use our best efforts to ensure its security on our systems.
