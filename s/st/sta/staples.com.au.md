Terms & Conditions and Legal Issues

 **STAPLES PRIVACY STATEMENT - Australia**

At Staples, we value the trust of our customers. To earn your trust, we respect your privacy in handling personal information relating to you and your transactions with us, whether at one of our Staples mail-order catalogue or on our web sites. This Privacy Statement describes who controls the information we gather about you, what information we gather about you, what we do with it and the safeguards we have in place to protect it.

**Who are we?**

We are Staples in Australia Pty Limited of 163 O'Riordan Street Mascot New South Wales 2020 ("Staples Australia").

**What personal information does Staples collect and what do we do with it?**

We collect information about you but only from you. This may be when you request a catalogue, place an order, enrol in a promotional program, send us a letter or e-mail, give us a telephone call or apply for an account. This information may include your name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card number and expiration date, and other demographic information, ordering and payment details, return requests or offers or other information submitted to you, as well as data relating to your use of our web site. Sometimes, we may need additional information from you - such as your age or date of birth, employment, or gender for marketing or promotional activities, or in connection with your participation in a voluntary special program.

We may share information with law enforcement or other entities as required by law or as we reasonably determine to be necessary to protect our rights or the rights of others, to prevent harm to persons or property, to fight fraud, or to enforce our web site terms of use.

Information may be transferred as an asset in connection with a merger or sale (including any transfers made as part of an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding) involving all or part of our businesses. 

Our affiliates and other organisations who work for us may have access to and use your information. Information may from time to time be retained on data storage systems owned and operated by these affiliates and other organisations in overseas locations. However Staples Australia will be responsible for ensuring those persons comply with this privacy statement. 

**What about web site "cookies"?**

Our web sites in Australia utilise "cookies" for limited purposes intended to provide you with a more convenient shopping experience, such as bypassing our opening splash, remembering your auto-login name and password, and maintaining items in your shopping cart if you leave the site before checkout. Cookies are small data files that are stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not give us control over your computer. Some of our business allies whose sites are accessible from our site may also use cookies, but we have no access to or control over these cookies.

**Links to other sites**

To make online shopping more convenient for you, our web site may provide access to other companies' web sites or co-branded web sites that may be displayed in "frames" through our web site. If you request additional information from one of the companies featured on our web site, we will provide that company with your e-mail address so that your request can be fulfilled. We are not responsible for the content appearing on these companies' web sites or for the privacy practices of these companies. We encourage you to read the privacy policy on the other company's web site if you have any concerns about how your information may be collected or used.

We also have information about visitors to our web site, notably but not limited to those who have received a targeted promotional campaign or have reacted to any advertisement referring to our web site or products and/or services, processed by reputable third-party advertising companies for the purpose of managing the content of our web site and of our advertising, learning which promotion or advertisement brings you to our web site, targeting our future campaigns, and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. For these purposes, we make use of interactive technologies, such as (i) pixel tags (also called clear gifs or transparent gif files) that are integrated in e-mails to your attention or advertisings published on web sites but that are not apparent for your visual comfort, (ii) cookies and/our web beacons placed by us, one of the above mentioned third-party advertising companies or another vendor working with one of them. The data generated through this technique helps us to understand what you like and do not like about our site so that we can make your visits more interesting and relevant. Personal information, if any generated by said techniques, is exclusively controlled by us, or contracted parties working for us and utilising this information exclusively on our behalf, and is subject to this Privacy Statement, this without prejudice to certain strictly anonymous and not personally identifiable data being shared with third-party advertising companies and/or other third parties. 

You may "opt-out" at any time from receiving promotional or marketing materials from us by emailing your request to [privacy@ce.com.au](mailto:privacy@ce.com.au) or by writing to us at
