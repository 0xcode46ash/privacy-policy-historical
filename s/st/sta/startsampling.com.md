# StartSampling: Privacy Policy

At StartSampling.com, your privacy is our priority. We are committed to protecting your privacy at all times, in all situations. The information we collect about you when you become a member is used to process your sample orders and to provide a more personalized sampling experience on our site.

**How Do We Use the Information We Collect?**  
When you become a StartSampling member, we ask you to fill out a form that requests your name, address and e-mail address as well as some demographic information such as gender, date of birth, marital status and information about your family and pets.

Your name and address information is used solely to process sample orders unless your prior consent is given. Without your consent, this information will NEVER be sold, given, rented or traded to others for purposes other than sample order fulfillment.

Your demographic information (gender, date of birth, etc.) is used for several purposes:

  * Demographic information is provided back to our customers (companies that provide us with product samples for you to select) in an aggregated way. For example, we may tell a customer that 65% of our members who selected their samples were male while 35% were female. We NEVER release individual demographics to a customer or any other party without your consent, except to the extent necessary for order fulfillment.
  * StartSampling, Inc. uses demographic information in aggregated terms to tailor our sales efforts. For example, if we know that 65% of our members have dogs we will try to line up some dog-related samples for our site.



**Our Use of Log Files**  
When you visit our site we automatically log your IP address, your browser type and your access times. We utilize this information to conduct site performance evaluations, to see where visitors are coming from and to keep track of click stream data (the screens our users visit on our site). This data helps us to determine what content our members find most appealing so that we can maximize your enjoyment of the site.

**Site Security**  
All StartSampling employees take your personal information very seriously. All employees must learn and obey our security policies. Access to member personal information is limited to key management personnel and our member services department. The information is ID and password protected and our Web security is reviewed on a monthly basis.

**Use of Intermediaries**  
StartSampling utilizes the services of an intermediary - the U.S. Postal Service - to send out the samples our members have selected. To our knowledge, the US Postal Service does not store, retain or use the information in any way. In some cases, we also use the order fulfillment services of third parties to get samples to you. These parties are contractually obligated with StartSampling to use your information only for the purpose of shipping your samples.

**Correcting/Updating Your Personal Information**  
After becoming a StartSampling member you may correct/update your personal information by clicking on the 'My Account' link at the top of any page, entering your ID, password and birth date when prompted and clicking the Edit Information button. The changes you make will be reflected in our databases instantly.

**Links To Other Sites**  
This Web site contains links to other Web sites. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you may be leaving the StartSampling site and entering another Web site. These sites may independently collect or request information about you and we encourage you to read the privacy statements of these linked sites as their privacy policy may differ from ours.

**Communication**  
From time to time we may send out email messages alerting you that samples are available or to remind you about providing feedback or earning Frequent Tryer Miles. In addition, you will receive communication from us if you contact us for a particular reason and to receive the samples you have requested.

**Opt-In Opportunities**  
StartSampling provides you with opt-in opportunities in two ways. First, our site will give you the opportunity to provide more information to us in exchange for Frequent Tryer Miles. These additional forms and SampleSurveys are completely optional. The information you provide if you choose to fill out these forms and surveys may be used to tailor offerings to you and may be shared - in aggregate terms only - with our customers. Second, in some cases, there will be opportunities to opt-in to allow manufacturers to contact you directly. You will always have the ability to choose whether you want to participate in these opportunities.

**Manufacturer Form**  
From a link at the bottom of our main page, we encourage representatives from product manufacturers to tell us how we can reach them if they are interested in finding out more about our sampling services. Use of this form is not intended for individual consumers. Responses are made to legitimate leads, while other information is discarded.

**Contests**  
Periodically, contests are run on our site. Sometimes contests are sponsored by our customers. To enter these contests you need only to enter your ID and password and your guess. At the time of entry, you may decide if you wish to have your first name and state posted on our site if you are the winner. Winners names are NEVER shared with our customers without their consent.

**Our Use of Cookies**  
Cookies are pieces of information that your browser stores on your computer's hard drive which, for some sites, identifies you when you enter. The ability to select samples on our site is not cookie-driven. Our site only utilizes cookies to keep track of your Frequent Tryer Miles and to tailor offers to you. To find out more about earning prizes by collecting Frequent Tryer Miles, [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20001201201500id_/http%3A//startsampling.com/miles.iphtml). If you have set your browser to reject cookies, our site will not recognize you when you enter and you will need to manually type in your ID and password to receive Frequent Tryer Miles for visiting and reading about manufacturers.

**Your Consent**  
By using our Web site you consent to the collection and use of the information you provide to us as described above. If we make any material changes in our privacy practices or in how we use your personally identifiable information, we will post a prominent notice on our site prior to implementation of the change.

**Your Feedback is Always Welcome**  
We welcome your comments and questions about our privacy policy - or anything else you might want to talk about. To contact us [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20001201201500id_/http%3A//startsampling.com/contactus.html).
