# StartSampling: Privacy Policy

At StartSampling.com, your privacy is our priority. We are committed to protecting your privacy at all times, in all situations. The information we collect about you when you become a subscriber is used to process your sample orders and to provide a more personalized sampling experience on our site.

**How Do We Use the Information We Collect?**  
When you become a StartSampling subscriber, we ask you to fill out a form that requests your name, address and e-mail address as well as some demographic information such as male/female, date of birth, marital status and information about your family and pets.

Your name and address information is used solely to process sample orders. This information will NEVER be sold, given, rented or traded to others.

Your demographic information (male/female, date of birth, etc.) is used for several purposes:

  * Demographic information is provided back to our customers (companies that provide us with product samples for selection and receipt by you) in an aggregated way. For example, we may tell a customer that 65% of our subscribers who selected their samples were male while 35% were female. We NEVER release individual demographics to a customer or any other party.
  * StartSampling, Inc. uses demographic information in aggregated terms to tailor our sales efforts. For example, if we know that 65% of our subscribers have dogs we will try to line up some dog-related samples for our site.



**Our Use of Log Files**  
When you visit our site we automatically log your IP address, your browser type and your access times. We utilize this information to conduct site performance evaluations, to see where visitors are coming from and to keep track of click stream data (the screens our users visit on our site).

**Site Security**  
All StartSampling employees take your personal information very seriously. All employees must learn and obey our security policies. Access to subscriber personal information is limited to key management personnel and is ID and password protected. Our Web security is reviewed on a monthly basis.

**Use of Intermediaries**  
StartSampling utilizes the services of an intermediary - the U.S. Postal Service - to send out the samples our subscribers have selected. This intermediary does not store, retain or use the information in any way.

**Correcting/Updating Your Personal Information**  
After becoming a StartSampling subscriber you may correct/update your personal information by clicking on the 'My Account' link at the top of any page, entering your ID, password and birthdate when prompted and clicking the Edit Information button. The changes you make will be reflected in our databases instantly.

**Links To Other Sites**  
This Web site contains links to other Web sites. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are clicking to another Web site. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of these linked sites as their privacy policy may differ from ours.

**Communication**  
From time to time we may send out email messages alerting you that samples are available or to remind you about providing feedback or earning Frequent Tryer Miles by sending in receipts and UPCs. In addition, you will receive communication from us if you contact us for a particular reason and to receive the samples you have requested.

**Opt-In Opportunities**  
On occasion, our site will give you the opportunity to provide more information to us in exchange for Frequent Tryer Miles. These additional forms and SampleSurveys are completely optional. The information you provide if you choose to fill out these forms and surveys may be used to tailor offerings to you and may be shared - in aggregate terms only \- with our customers. Individual information is NEVER shared with a third party.

**Manufacturer Form**  
From a link at the bottom of our main page, we encourage representatives from product manufacturers to tell us how we can reach them if they are interested in finding out more about our sampling services. This form is not meant to be filled out by individual consumers. Legitimate leads are followed up on while other information is discarded.

**Contests**  
Periodically, contests are run on our site. Sometimes contests are sponsored by our customers. To enter these contests you need only to enter your ID and password and your guess. At the time of entry, you may decide if you wish to have your first name and state posted on our site if you are the winner. Winners names are NEVER shared with our customers.

**Our Use of Cookies**  
Cookies are pieces of information that your browser stores on your computer's hard drive which, for some sites, identifies you when you enter. The ability to select samples on our site is not cookie-driven. Our site only utilizes cookies to keep track of your Frequent Tryer Miles and the 'votes' you place in the 'If we get themâ€¦will you sample' section.

If you have set your browser to reject cookies, our site will not recognize you when you enter and you will need to manually type in your ID and password to receive Frequent Tryer Miles for visiting and reading about manufacturers.

**Your Consent**  
By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of the information you provide to us. If our privacy policy changes in any way we will make the revised information available on this screen immediately and we will put a prominent notice on our main page. Rest assured, we will NEVER change our policy of protecting your privacy and never compromise it with a third party.
