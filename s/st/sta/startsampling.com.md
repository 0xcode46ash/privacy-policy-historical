# StartSampling: Privacy Policy

At StartSampling.com, your privacy is our priority. We are committed to protecting your privacy at all times, in all situations. The information we collect about you when you become a subscriber is used to process your sample orders and to provide a more personalized sampling and shopping experience on our site.

**How do we use the information we collect?  
**When you become a StartSampling subscriber, we ask you to fill out a form that requests your name, address and e-mail address as well as some demographic information such as male/female, date of birth, married or not, children or not and pets or not.

Your name and address information is used solely to process sample orders and product purchases you conduct on our site. This information will NEVER be sold, given, rented or traded to others.

Your demographic information (male/female, date of birth, etc.) is used for several purposes:

  * Demographic information is provided back to our clients (companies who provide us with their product samples for selection and receipt by you, the consumer) in an aggregated way. For example, we may tell a client that 65% of the people who selected their samples were male while 35% were female. We NEVER release individual demographics to a client or any other party.
  * StartSampling, Inc. uses demographic information in aggregated terms to tailor our sales efforts. For example, if we know that 65% of our subscribers have pets we will try to line up some pet-related samples for availability on our site.



**Our use of "cookies" (no, not the kind that are good with milk)  
**"Cookies" are pieces of information that your browser stores on your computer's hard drive which, for some sites, identifies you when you enter. The ability to select samples and purchase/bid on products on our site is not cookie - driven. Our site only utilizes cookies to keep track of your Frequent Tryer Miles and the votes that you place in the _If we get them ... will you sample_ section.

**Your Consent  
**By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of the information you provide to us. If our privacy policy changes in some way we will make the revised information available on this screen immediately. Rest assured, we will NEVER change our policy of protecting your privacy and never compromise it with a third party.

**Your Feedback is Always Welcome  
**We welcome your comments and questions about our privacy policies - or anything else you might want to talk about. Please send e-mail to [feedback@startsampling.com](mailto:feedback@startsampling.com).
