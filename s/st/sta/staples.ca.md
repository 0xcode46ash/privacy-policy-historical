**Security and Privacy**

Our **Shopping Security** ensures that your credit card information is safe and your privacy respected. We protect your shopping experience by: 

  * utilizing SSL Technology 
  * hosting Our Site on Secure Servers 
  * maintaining Secure Site status from security industry leader VeriSign 
  * allowing you to opt out of any online or traditional telemarketing efforts 



We collect information so we can best meet your needs and notify you of offers that may be of interest. We firmly believe it's your right to know what information we collect, how we use it, and what your options are. Below you can find more detailed information about online security, information collection and use, and how to contact us. 

**What Keeps My Credit Card Safe?**   


At this web site, whenever you provide any personal information (e.g. when making a purchase, requesting a catalogue, completing an e-mail form), we encrypt it so that no one can read it while it is being transmitted over the Internet. At this time, all information (such as your name and address) is safely stored behind a firewall. A firewall is a set of related programs that protects your information from users from other networks. We store this type of information so that you do not have to re-enter it each time you make a purchase or log in. 

**Is My Personal Information Safe?**   


Yes, any personal information that you submit to the site will remain safe and secure. In order to offer you an individualized shopping experience we collect various types of information such as: 

  * domain names of visitors to our Web site 
  * e-mail addresses of those who e-mail us or register with us 
  * information on how many visits each page receives 
  * user-specific information on what pages consumers visit 
  * information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations 

We then study this information to determine how we can create the best shopping experience available for you. By looking at usage patterns, we know which areas need expansion and which areas are not meeting your needs. We also collect information so that we can help you personalize the site, receive notice about special updates, and have access to unique marketing messages.
