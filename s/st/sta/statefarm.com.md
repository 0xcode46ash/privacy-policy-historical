Notice of Privacy Policy**

**State Farm Family of Companies****

We value you as a customer and take your personal privacy seriously. We will inform you of our policies for collecting, using, securing, and sharing nonpublic personal information ("customer information") the first time we do business and every year that you are a State Farm customer.

**Our Privacy Principles:**

  * We do not sell customer information.
  * We do not provide customer information to persons or organizations outside our State Farm family of companies who are doing business on our behalf, for their own marketing purposes.
  * We contractually require any person or organization providing products or services to customers on our behalf to protect the confidentiality of State Farm customer information.
  * We do not share customer medical information with anyone within the State Farm family of companies, unless you expressly authorize it, or unless your insurance policy contract with us permits us to do so.
  * We afford prospective and former customers the same protections as existing customers with respect to the use of personal information. 



**Information We May Collect**  
We collect and use information we believe is necessary to administer our business, to advise you about our products and services, and to provide you with customer service. We may collect and maintain several types of customer information needed for these purposes, such as those below. 

Types of information we may collect and how we gather it:

  * From you, (on applications for our insurance, banking and investment products, or on other forms, through telephone or in-person interviews, your State Farm agent, and our Customer Response Center) such as your address and telephone number  

  * From your transactions with us, such as your payment history, underwriting, and claim documents  

  * From non-State Farm companies, such as your driving record and claim history  

  * From consumer reporting agencies, such as your credit history



**How We Use Information About You**  
We use customer information to underwrite your policies, process your claims, ensure proper billing, service your accounts, and offer you other State Farm insurance or financial products that we believe may suit your needs. 

**Information Disclosure**  
We share information about our transactions (such as payment of premium) and experiences (such as an auto accident) with you within our State Farm family of companies and with State Farm agents to better serve you and to assist in meeting your current product and service needs. We may also disclose customer information about you to persons or organizations inside or outside our family of companies as permitted or required by law, including companies that perform marketing services for us or with whom we have joint marketing agreements. These agreements allow us to provide a broader selection of insurance and financial products to you today. 

We share customer information as necessary to handle your claim and to protect you against fraud and unauthorized transactions. For example, we might share customer information such as name, address, and coverage information with an auto body shop to speed up repairs on an auto damage claim. 

**Your Choice to Share Information**  
There are two types of information sharing--information sharing within State Farm’s family of companies and information sharing outside State Farm. We do not sell customer information. We do not provide customer information to persons or organizations outside State Farm who are doing business on our behalf, for their own marketing purposes. The choice in the Special Notice, which follows, applies only to sharing of information within the State Farm family of companies and with your State Farm agent. For example, if you are an auto policyholder, our ability to share information among the State Farm companies allows us not to ask again about your driving record when you apply for a boat policy.

**SPECIAL NOTICE REGARDING THE SHARING OF CERTAIN INFORMATION WITHIN THE  
STATE FARM FAMILY OF COMPANIES.  
This notice applies only to the sharing of information within State Farm that does not involve your transactions or experiences with us. **

**What Information We Share:** Unless you tell us not to, we may share information within State Farm that was obtained from your application, such as your occupation; or information obtained from a consumer report, such as your credit history. We may also verify information provided by you, such as your driving record; or information regarding your employment, such as your employment history. 

**Why We Share:** We may share information about you within State Farm to enhance our service to you, to underwrite your policies, to measure your interest in our products and services, to improve existing products and develop new ones, and to monitor customer trends.

**Who We Share With:** We may share information within the State Farm family of companies and with State Farm agents, including:

  * State Farm car and home insurers, such as State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company and State Farm Fire and Casualty Company 
  * State Farm life and health insurers, such as State Farm Life Insurance Company and State Farm Mutual 
  * State Farm financial services, such as State Farm Bank, State Farm Funding Corp., and State Farm Mutual Fund Trust.



**If you prefer that we not share this information within State Farm, call us toll-free at 1- 800-865-6035. Your choice will also apply to your joint account holders and/or policyholders.**

**Your direction not to share this information does not limit State Farm from sharing certain information about your transactions with us (such as your name, address, and payment history) or your experiences with us (such as your State Farm claim activity). This choice does not apply to our efforts to market products and services to you--you may receive information about State Farm insurance and financial products that we believe may suit your needs.**

**State Farm Protects Customer Information**  
We maintain physical, electronic, and organizational safeguards to protect customer information. We continually review our policies and practices, monitor our computer networks, and test the strength of our security in order to help us ensure the safety of customer information.

Thank you for choosing State Farm. We value you as a customer and appreciate the opportunity to serve you.
