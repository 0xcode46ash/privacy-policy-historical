# Privacy Policies

## STATE FARM® family of companies**

We value you as a customer and we know how much privacy means to you. We will inform you of our policies for collecting, using, securing, and sharing customer information the first time we do business with you and every year you are a State Farm customer. 

### **OUR PRIVACY PRINCIPLES**

  * We do not sell customer information. 
  * We do not allow those who are doing business on our behalf to use our customer information for their own marketing purposes. 
  * We contractually require any person or organization providing products or services on our behalf to protect State Farm customer information. 
  * We do not share customer medical information with anyone within the State Farm family of companies unless: 
    * You expressly authorize it; or 
    * It is permitted or required by law; or 
    * Your insurance policy contract with us permits us to do so. 
  * We afford our prospective and former customers the same protections as existing customers with respect to the use of personal information. 



### **  
INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT**

We collect, use, and share information we need to conduct our business, to advise you of our products and services, and to provide you with customer service. We may collect and maintain several types of customer information needed for these purposes, such as those below.

**Types of information we may collect and how we gather it:**

  * From you; on applications for our insurance, banking, and investment products; from other policies or products you have with us; or on other forms, through telephone or in-person interviews, your State Farm agent, and our Customer Response Center, such as your address and telephone number.
  * From your transactions or experiences with us; such as your payment history and underwriting and claim records 
  * From the State Farm family of companies and non-State Farm companies, organizations, or consumer reporting agencies, such as your driving record, claim history, or credit information 



**For those visiting statefarm.com** ®

We want to make you aware of how we use “cookies” to enhance your experience when visiting statefarm.com. “Cookies” are files we place in your computer’s browser to store your State Farm Web site preferences. We use “cookies” and other technologies to help us track visits to our Web site and to find out how visitors use our site. This information may be used to manage and customize our Web site’s content, layout, and services in order to improve our site and enhance our service to you. 

Aside from providing you with a customized Web site, using “cookies” allows State Farm to manage our online advertising. We use third party online advertising companies to provide ads on Web sites where we advertise. Some of these sites may use “cookies” and other technologies when you click or move your cursor over our ads. This technology will transmit non-personally identifiable information about you to us or our service providers. We use this information to analyze our marketing efforts and track browser visits to our Web site. It is also used to measure and manage our advertising at other sites. For more information about marketing “cookies” and other technologies, and to opt-out, go to: <http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/>.

Each of the Web sites we use to advertise and from which we collect data should post a privacy statement that fully describes the advertising and data collection activities of that site. However, we cannot be assured all Web sites provide such guidance. We recommend you check the privacy policy of any Web site before you provide any personally identifiable information.

### **HOW WE USE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU**

We use customer information, including consumer report information, to underwrite and/or rate your policies and products, process your claims, ensure proper billing, service your accounts, and offer you other insurance and financial services products that may suit your needs. 

### **INFORMATION DISCLOSURE**

We share information about our transactions (such as payment of premium) and experiences (such as an auto accident) with you within our State Farm family of companies and with State Farm agents to better serve you and to help meet your current product and service needs. We may share information about you with persons or organizations inside or outside our family of companies as permitted or required by law, including sharing with companies that perform marketing or other services for us or with whom we have joint marketing agreements. These agreements allow us to provide a broader selection of insurance and financial products to you. 

We may also share customer information with consumer reporting agencies and with other entities as needed to handle your claim and to protect against fraud and unauthorized transactions. For example, we might share name, address, and coverage information with an auto body shop to speed up repairs on auto damage claims. 

### **YOUR CHOICE TO SHARE INFORMATION**

There are two types of information sharing - sharing within the State Farm family of companies and sharing outside State Farm. We do not sell customer information. We do not allow those who are doing business on our behalf to use our customer information for their own marketing purposes. The choice in the Special Notice, which follows, applies only to the sharing of information within the State Farm family of companies. For example, if you are an auto policyholder, our ability to share information among the State Farm family of companies allows us not to ask again about your driving record when you apply for a boat policy. 

### **SPECIAL NOTICE REGARDING THE SHARING OF CERTAIN INFORMATION WITHIN THE STATE FARM FAMILY OF COMPANIES**

**This special notice applies only to information sharing within State Farm that does not involve your transactions or experiences with us.**

**WHAT INFORMATION WE SHARE:** Unless you tell us not to, we may share information within State Farm that was obtained from your application, such as your occupation; or information obtained from a consumer report, such as your credit history. We may also verify information provided by you, such as your driving record; or information regarding your employment, such as your employment history. This sharing may take place unless you have told us not to share this information. 

**WHY WE SHARE:** We may share information about you within State Farm:

  * To enhance our service to you. 
  * To underwrite and/or rate your policies and products. 
  * To measure your interest in our products or services. 
  * To research, develop, and improve our products and models. 
  * To monitor customer trends. 



**WHO WE SHARE WITH:** We may share information within the State Farm family of companies, including: 

  * State Farm car and home insurers, such as State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company and State Farm Fire and Casualty Company. 
  * State Farm life and health insurers, such as State Farm Life Insurance Company and State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company. 
  * State Farm financial services, such as State Farm Bank®, State Farm Funding Corp., and State Farm Mutual Fund Trust. 



If you are a new customer and you prefer that State Farm not share your personal information among our family of companies, call or write your State Farm agent or call us toll-free at 1-800-865-6035. Your choice will also apply to your joint account holders and/or policyholders. 

If you are an existing customer and have already told us your sharing preference, no action is needed unless you want to change your information sharing preference. To change your preference at any time, call or write your State Farm agent or call the toll-free number listed above. 

Your choice does not limit State Farm from sharing certain information about your transactions with us (such as your name, address, and payment history) or your experiences with us (such as your State Farm claim activity). This choice does not apply to our efforts to market products and services to you - you may receive information about other insurance and financial services products that may suit your needs.1

### **STATE FARM PROTECTS CUSTOMER INFORMATION**

In order to ensure the safety of customer information, we continually: 

  * Maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards 
  * Review our policies and practices 
  * Monitor our computer networks 
  * Test the strength of our security 



1This sharing option does not apply to our Canadian customers if the product or policy was purchased in Canada.
