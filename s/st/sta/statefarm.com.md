PRIVACY & SECURITY

We value your privacy.

This is our Notice of Privacy Policy, and we’ll provide it the first time we do business with you and upon request or as required by law thereafter.

This Notice describes how we protect, collect, use, and share customer information. Customer information means all nonpublic information related to an identified individual, which is sometimes called personally identifiable information. Customer information does not include anonymized data or de-identified data, which do not identify an individual.

### Our Privacy Principles

  * We do not sell customer information.
  * We do not allow those who are doing business on our behalf to use our customer information for their own marketing purposes.
  * We contractually require any person or organization providing products or services on our behalf to protect State Farm customer information.
  * We do not share customer medical information within the State Farm family of companies unless: 
    * you expressly authorize it; or
    * it is permitted or required by law; or
    * your insurance policy contract with us permits us to do so.
  * We may share customer information and permit others to use that information if you give us your consent, it is necessary to complete a transaction you request, or it is otherwise permitted by law.
  * We handle information about former and prospective customers the same as existing customers.
