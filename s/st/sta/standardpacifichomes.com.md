In addition, when users request pages on the Website, the Company’s servers automatically log the users IP address. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web.

However, if the Company correlates any Aggregate Information to you, such information will be treated like Personal Information under this Policy. 

5\. **_Cookies_**. The Company may make use of "cookies" on the Website. Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's computer by a web server based on the permissions set in a user's browser software. A cookie itself is not designed or intended to read any information from a user's computer (other than the contents of the cookie); rather, it is an identifier used by the website that originally placed it on your hard drive. The actual contents of the cookie information can be retrieved by the same server to identify the computer and subsequently to customize, monitor, or regulate the use of a site based on information stored in the cookie and the host server. Therefore, cookies only identify the user's computer to the website that may correlate other information, including personal information, with the cookie.

We reserve the right to reasonably delay such notification as may reasonably be necessary as part of any internal investigation or law enforcement efforts related to such breach. I usually put Children info here since it is the Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act that you are complying with so, in some sense, you lack of collection of personally identifiable info from children is a privacy issue. 

8\. **_Outside Links_**. While on the Website, you may be referred to web sites other than the Company’s Website. A link from the Website to such a third party website does not imply endorsement of that site nor any ability to control that site's privacy practices.
