 Standard Pacific Corp. Privacy Policy

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE ACCESSING ANY PART OF THE WEBSITE 

1\. Overview. Standard Pacific Corp. (the “Company”) recognizes and respects the privacy of the users of this website (the “Website”). The following privacy policy, as modified from time to time by us as described below (this “Policy”), tells you about the information that the Company collects through this Website, how we use that information, and how you can opt out of certain uses of information we may collect.  Your access and use of the Website, constitutes your understanding and acceptance of, and agreement to this Policy and the information collection and use practices described herein.  If you do not agree with this Policy, please do not access and use the Website. 

Please note that this Policy applies to all information collected on this Website by the Company, but does not apply to Personal Information (as defined below) and Financial Information (as defined below) that may be collected by our mortgage subsidiary, Standard Pacific Mortgage, Inc. (“Standard Pacific Mortgage”), which has its own privacy policies. 

2\. Amendments to Privacy Policy.  The Company reserves the right to amend this Policy from time to time in its sole discretion, and will post and maintain the most recent version of this Policy on this Website. The Company will not notify its Website visitors or customers of any such amendments by e-mail or other personal contact.  You are responsible for reviewing this Policy upon each visit to the Website.  

3\. Information The Company May Collect About You.  We collect the following types of information on the Website: 

"Personal Information" is information that is used by the Company to identify you individually, such as your name and address. 

"Aggregate Information" is information that does not contain Personal Information or from which Personal Information has been removed. An example of Aggregate Information is information about use of the Website, such as pages visited on the Website. 

"Financial Information" means financial information collected when loan prequalification is requested. 

The actual information we collect from you depends on the services you use on the Website. The following is a more detailed explanation of some of the types and uses of information we collect. 

Email Services. If you provide us with your email address and opt in to any email notification features that the Company may now have or may develop in the future, you may receive email from time to time from the Company. Each email you receive from the Company will contain an “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the email message which will provide you the opportunity to opt out of receiving future communications from the Company by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link and following the unsubscribe instructions. 

Information Request Forms. The Website contains various request forms that allow you to request information, products and services and to submit resumes to the Company. For instance, we may collect information such as your preferences regarding location, size and price of a new home. When we collect such information, we may share it with third parties as is necessary to respond to your request. 

Your Notebook.  The “Your Notebook” feature on the Website requires you to register by providing your email address.  Once registered, you can input and save your preferences regarding location, size, price and other features of a new home, and then log in to your account during future visits to the Website to learn about any developments or updates related to your preferred homes.  We may also send you email notifications of such developments or updates. 

Prequalification Form.  If you would like to request a preliminary determination of the potential amount of credit you might qualify for towards the purchase of a new Standard Pacific home, you may complete and submit the Prequalification Form on the Website.  (The Prequalification Form is not an application for a mortgage loan and is not a commitment to lend.)  The form requests a variety of Personal Information and Financial Information, including your name, email address, phone number, social security number, employment information, and information about your income, expenses and assets. Information collected is used solely for the purposes of loan prequalification by Standard Pacific Mortgage, an affiliate of the Company, in accordance with the authorizations you provide.

Surveys. From time to time, we may collect information through online surveys, questionnaires or information requests on the Website. These surveys may request demographic information (such as age range, gender, areas of interest) and customer feedback. Participation in such surveys, questionnaires or information requests is voluntary and with each request you will have the choice of whether or not to disclose information. We may use such survey information to analyze the Website and to improve users' overall experience on the Website. 

Administrative Purposes. We may collect and use information that identifies you personally when you submit comments, questions or suggestions through the Website. For example, if you submit questions to webmaster@stanpac.com or submit information requests we will use the information you provide to respond to you. We also may collect and use your information to contact you when necessary for other administrative purposes. If you do submit comments, questions or suggestions through the Website, please do not include confidential personal or financial information in such requests. Such e-mail will be maintained in accordance with our corporate e-mail and document retention policies. 

Resumes. If you submit your resume to us or complete a form related to a job opening on the Website, we may use the information to contact you, in our sole discretion, or we may store it in our files in a manner consistent with the way we store other information related to job applications.

4\. Disclosure of Your Personal, Aggregate, and Financial Information. 

Personal Information. The Company will not sell or disclose your Personal Information without your consent except as set forth below. 

Consultants. From time to time the Company engages consultants that may need access to the information we collect to perform their services for us, such as administering our mailing lists. We require that our consultants keep Personal Information confidential and use it only in accordance with the service agreement between the Company and such consultant. 

Transaction Processing. When you complete an information request form or otherwise indicate to us that you want us to provide you with a product or service (such as a request to be included in mailings about our future projects or a request for loan prequalification), we share and maintain the data needed for you to receive the products or services you have requested. 

Legal Requirements. We may disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law or if we believe that such action is reasonably necessary to: (a) conform with the law, respond to claims or comply with legal process served on the Company or the Website; or (b) protect and defend our rights or property, including the Website, our employees, guests or the public. 

Company Sale. Because information collected through the Website is a trade secret and asset of the Company, we may disclose or sell such information in the event we entertain the sale of the Company or some or all of its assets. 

Employment. If you submit a resume or other information to us in connection with a job opening at the Company, we may disclose or transfer Personal Information and any other information you submit to employees and consultants involved in the recruiting and hiring of job applicants.

Aggregate Information: The Company collects "Aggregate Information" about you and your use of the Website whenever you visit the Company online. For instance, the Company may collect various forms of "click stream" information such as entry and exit points for our Website (i.e., referring URLs or domains), site traffic statistics, page views, impressions, and operating system and browser type. In addition, when users request pages on the Website, the Company’s servers automatically log the users’ IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. The Company may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and all Aggregate Information. However, if the Company correlates any Aggregate Information to you, such information will be treated like Personal Information under this Policy. 

Financial Information:  If you complete the Loan Prequalification Form, the Company will disclose any Financial Information that you have submitted to our affiliate, Standard Pacific Mortgage, in order to process your request for loan prequalification. 

Apart from the loan prequalification form, no portion of the Standard Pacific Mortgage mortgage application process takes place on or through the Website. Mortgage applications are currently accepted in Standard Pacific Mortgage’s sales offices. In connection with the submission of a mortgage application, Standard Pacific Mortgage will provide the applicant with a written copy of Standard Pacific Mortgage’s own information privacy statement, which will describe the collection and use of the applicant’s Personal Information and Financial Information. 

5\. Cookies. The Company may make use of "cookies" on the Website. Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's computer by a web server based on the permissions set in a user's browser software. A cookie itself is not designed or intended to read any information from a user's computer (other than the contents of the cookie); rather, it is an identifier used by the website that originally placed it on your hard drive. The actual contents of the cookie information can be retrieved by the same server to identify the computer and subsequently to customize, monitor, or regulate the use of a site based on information stored in the cookie and the host server. Therefore, cookies only identify the user's computer to the website that may correlate other information, including personal information, with the cookie. Cookies allow the Company to automate access and data entry functions of the Website such as login information, correlate online ordering information for purchases, tailor the Website to your preferences or interests, or customize promotions or marketing. In addition, cookies allow us to track usage of the Website to determine which areas are useful or popular and which are not, thereby enabling us to improve and update the Website effectively. 

6\. Security. The Company uses reasonable efforts to store and maintain personal information to protect it from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction by any unauthorized party. If you are asked to provide Personal Information or Financial Information in connection with your request for the Company’s products or services, such information will be collected through a secure internet connection using reasonable commercial security measures. We store no Personal Information or Financial Information on the Website.  When we do transmit your data, we use only secure servers using current encryption technology to encode your data safely. We make reasonable efforts to attempt to prevent the unauthorized access of our systems containing personal data. 

7\. Breach of Security. In the event of a breach of our information system security that may compromise your Personal Information or Financial Information, we will promptly notify you of such breach at the e-mail address that we have on file for you. We reserve the right to reasonably delay such notification as may reasonably be necessary as part of any internal investigation or law enforcement efforts related to such breach. 

8\. Outside Links. While on the Website, you may be referred to websites other than the Company’s Website. A link from the Website to such a third party website does not imply endorsement of that website nor any ability to control that website's privacy practices. Be aware that third party websites may collect data and personal and financial information and operate according to their own privacy practices. Therefore, you should carefully review the privacy policies of third party websites before submitting any Personal Information or Financial Information to them. 

9\. Opting Out, Removal of Personal or Financial Information and Contacting Us. Any time you provide us with Personal Information, the Website provides you with an opportunity to opt out of receiving further communications from us. To opt out of receiving information or to unsubscribe from any specific email service, you can (a) click on the subscriptions management link in the email or (b) log into your Website account and manage subscriptions from within that account.  The subscriptions management process allows each Website user to remove themselves from individual types/categories of communications or to unsubscribe from all communications. 

If you have questions or concerns about this Policy, or the accuracy of any Personal Information or Financial Information we have collected and are holding about you, please contact us at webmaster@stanpac.com or at Standard Pacific Corp., Attn: Website Privacy Policy, 26 Technology Drive, Irvine, California 92618.
