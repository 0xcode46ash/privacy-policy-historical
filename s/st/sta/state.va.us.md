The following represents practices and procedures of the Virginia Information Providers Network (VIPNet) Authority as approved by its Board of Directors. The VIPNet Authority reserves the right to change these practices and procedures at any time without prior notice. The following is not intended and should not be interpreted as a contract of any nature, either stated or implied.

Individuals who visit the Virginia Information Providers Network are important to us. Because visitors to our Web site are important, we do not capture personal information about them without their permission. We endeavor to ensure that we collect only the minimum amount of information needed to meet the purpose for which the network was created. 

VIPNet may be required to collect personal information, such as a user's name and address, because of legal requirements or in order to provide customer services. In doing so we are subject to the requirements for administering information systems as established in the Virginia Privacy Protection Act, Chapter 26 of Title 2.1 of the _Code of Virginia_. Pages that appear after you click on a link may be controlled by a different agency or entity, whose practices are not under the VIPNet Authority's control.

We do collect personal information directly from individuals who volunteer to subscribe to one or more of VIPNet’s premium services. Collecting personal information is necessary in order for VIPNet to deliver the services requested. 

Fostering and maintaining the public's trust is a cornerstone of VIPNet. We appreciate the trust and confidence that you place in us by providing requested personal information. 

**_Use, collection, and retention of customer information at the Virginia Information Providers Network_**

For each visitor, we collect information about the Internet Protocol (IP) address, type of browser used, the date and time of the visit, and the IP addresses of the locations to which the visitor linked during his or her visit to our Web site. This information is strictly used for statistical reporting purposes. 

We collect, retain and use personal information about our customers, other than mentioned above, only when they volunteer to subscribe to a VIPNet premium service. We only collect, retain and use personal information where we believe it is essential (and allowed by law) to administer our business and to provide products, services and other opportunities requested by our customers.

"Cookies" are small files either stored on a server or sent back to a visiting computer. In certain applications user information is stored as "cookies" of the type that are then sent back and stored on the user's computer. Any application or web page that uses cookies will identify itself as such. This information is handled in the same way as other user information obtained by VIPNet. No user information is gathered through cookies except for that needed to run the specific application.

**_Restrictions on the disclosure of customer information_**

We do not sell or rent our subscribers’ information to any outside company or organization. We do not reveal specific information about subscribers or other personally identifiable data to unaffiliated third parties for their independent use, except if required to do so by the Virginia Freedom of Information Act or other law.

**_Protection of information via established security procedures_**

We maintain security standards and procedures regarding unauthorized access to customer information to prevent unauthorized removal or alteration of data. 

**_Maintenance of accurate information_**

We have established procedures to ensure that information is as accurate and current as is practical to enable us to conduct business with you. Although we strive to do things right the first time, we also respond to requests to correct inaccurate information in a timely manner.

**_Limiting employee access to information_**

Our network manager is instructed to limit employee access to personally identifiable information to only those employees who need access in order to perform their assigned duties. The network manager is instructed to enforce with its staff their responsibilities in protecting subscriber’s information.

**_Privacy issues relating to the Federal Child Privacy Act_**

The Federal Child Privacy Act regulates Web site's collection of personal information on users under 18 years of age. We do not intentionally collect such information on anyone we know to be under 18 years of age. If such information is inadvertently obtained, the minor's parent or legal guardian may [contact VIPNet](mailto:customerservice@vipnet.org) for a description of the specific types of personal information collected from the child and the options available to them under [law](http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/ch91.html#PC91) to ensure their child's safety.

**_Privacy issues relating to the Live Chat service_**

The Live Chat service is the My Virginia portal's live customer service application that allows visitors to talk with customer service representatives in real-time. Certain information is collected and maintained in regards to the Live Chat service. In addition to IP address, browser type, date and time of the visit, and the referring web page, transcripts of the chats are saved for statistical, demographic, and/or customer service purposes. Some information is also collected through chat surveys on a volunteer basis.
