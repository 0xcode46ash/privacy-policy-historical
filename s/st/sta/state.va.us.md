The following represents practices and procedures of the Virginia Information Providers Network (VIPNet) Authority as currently approved by its Board of Directors. The VIPNet Authority reserves the right to change these practices and procedures at any time without prior notice. The following is not intended and should not be interpreted as a contract of any nature, either stated or implied.

Individuals who visit the Virginia Information Providers Network are important to us. Because visitors to our Web site are important, we do not capture personal information about them without their permission. We endeavor to ensure that we collect only the minimum amount of information needed to meet the purpose for which the network was created. 

Though personal information may be required either by law or in order for us to provide a requested service, in doing so we are subject to the requirements for administering information systems as established in the Virginia Privacy Protection Act, Chapter 26 of Title 2.1 of the _Code of Virginia_. Pages that appear after you click on a link may be controlled by a different agency or entity, whose practices are not under the VIPNet Authority's control.

We do collect personal information directly from individuals who volunteer to subscribe to one or more of VIPNet’s premium services. Collecting personal information is necessary in order for VIPNet to deliver the services requested. Fostering and maintaining the public's trust is a cornerstone of VIPNet. We appreciate the trust and confidence that you place in us by providing requested personal information.
