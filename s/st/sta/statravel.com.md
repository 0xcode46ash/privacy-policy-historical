# STA TRAVEL | Privacy Policy

## Your Privacy Is Very Important to Us

STA Travel, Inc. ("STA Travel") protects the privacy of all of our customers whether you visit one of our locations or our internet website, statravel.com ("the Website").

We have developed a privacy policy to keep you informed of what personally identifiable information ("PII") we may collect from you, what this information will be used for, with whom such information will be shared, and the security procedures we have implemented to protect your privacy.  (PII includes information that can be linked to a specific individual, such as name, address, phone number, or email address.)

## STA Travel Does Not Sell or Rent Your Personal Information to Anyone

When you become a member of the Website or make travel arrangements with STA Travel and you provide information about yourself, we use this information to complete your order, fulfill any customer service requests and provide promotional information via email. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete your order and fulfill your travel arrangements.

Such other parties may include, but shall not be limited to, appropriate airlines, credit card merchant services, and the SABRE reservation system.

These service providers will disclose information about your traveler profile to hotel, airline, cruise, rental car, and other travel suppliers whose products you have purchased. Although STA Travel attempts to select travel suppliers that are reputable companies, we have not placed limitations on these suppliers from using or disclosing your information without your permission.  Therefore, we encourage you to review the information privacy practices of any travel suppliers whose products you purchase on statravel.com.  In addition, these travel suppliers may also contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about your confirmed reservation.

We use your email address or telephone number to respond when you submit a question or suggestion.  Although no PII is collected, we monitor users’ navigation of our Website in order to better understand and serve our customers.

STA Travel may disclose the information that we collect about you when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against persons or entities who may be causing injury to you, to us, or to others. We may also disclose your information when we believe the law requires it.

## Control over and Access to Your Information

STA Travel believes that members and Website visitors should have control over the collection and use of their PII. You can access and update your information in the following areas of statravel.com:

After logging in, the My Profile page allows members to view and change their personal profile information settings.  On this page you can change your personal and contact information, password, credit card and billing information, and view your order history.

## Security

The importance of security for all PII associated with our customers is of utmost concern to us.  However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we will use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.  In order to protect the information stored in our systems, we have implemented security measures, including data encryption technology and firewalls.

## Third-Party Links

The Website may contain links to web sites operated and maintained by third parties over whom we have no control.  The information practices of those web sites are not covered by this privacy policy.  Any information you provide to third-party web sites or that we provide in relation to travel reservations you made will be governed under the terms of each such website's privacy policy.  We have no responsibility or liability whatsoever for the content, actions, or policies of third-party web sites.  We encourage you to read the privacy policies of all third-party web sites that link to the Website, because such privacy policies may be materially different from this privacy policy.  An example of such a third-party website is the Destination information provided by Lonely Planet.

## Privacy and Your Personal Information

STA Travel collects PII about you that you voluntarily provide.  Although you are required to register as a member of statravel.com in order to use certain travel planning tools, and some PII is needed in order to process and fulfill travel requests, many areas of statravel.com can be accessed without providing any PII.
