> At STAR, our customers are our highest priority.  So naturally we want to protect the personal and financial information you’ve entrusted with us.   For this reason, we would like to explain some of our procedures, which are intended to protect your privacy. 
> 
> 1)      **Restrictions on the Disclosure of Account Information**
> 
> Financial institutions should not reveal specific information about customer accounts or other personally identifiable data to unaffiliated third parties for their independent use, except for the exchange of information with reputable information reporting agencies to maximize the accuracy and security of such information or in the performance of bona fide corporate due diligence, unless 1) the information is provided to help complete a customer initiated transaction; 2) the customer requests it; 3) the disclosure is required by/or allowed by law (e.g., subpoena, investigation of fraudulent activity, etc); or 4) the customer has been informed about the possibility of disclosure for marketing or similar purposes through a prior communication and is given the opportunity to decline (i.e., “opt out”).

> 2)      **Information We Share with Consumer Reporting Agencies**
> 
> It is commonplace for financial institutions like STAR to share information about customer accounts with consumer reporting agencies.  However, if you believe some of the information we have shared or may share is in error, please let us know by writing to: STAR Financial Bank, 
> 
> 3)      **Information We Share within STAR**
> 
> To be able to respond to your inquiries and determine which STAR products would be most useful to you, our Web server automatically recognizes the consumer’s domain name and e-mail address.  We collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail.  We also collect information on what page consumers access or visit and information volunteered by the consumer, such as application and survey information.   The information we collect is used to: improve the content of our Web for your future visits, customize the content and/or layout of our pages for each individual consumer, notify consumers about updates to our Web site, and notify consumers of new products.

> 4)      **Promotional Offers We Share with You**
> 
> If we have a promotional offer or product which we think would be of interest to you, we may let you know by mail, phone, e-mail, and sometimes with the help of a third-party communication company.  In all cases, we only work with approved vendors who meet our security and privacy concerns and who agree, in writing, to hold confidential all customer information and allow us to check their practice of our strict standards. 
> 
> Many customers find these special offers helpful, as they are informative and sometimes communicate special pricing. 
> 
> 5)      **Limiting Employee Access to Information**
> 
> We seek to limit employee access to personally identifiable information to those with a business reason for knowing such information.  STAR believes in educating employees so that they will understand the importance of confidentiality and customer privacy and believes in taking appropriate measures to enforce employee privacy responsibilities.
