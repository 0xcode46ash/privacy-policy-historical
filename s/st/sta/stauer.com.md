### What Personal Information About Customers Does NextTen Gather?

|   
The information we learn from our customers helps us personalize and improve your shopping experience with NextTen. Here are the types of information we gather.   
  
  
---  
  
  * Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information that you enter on our Web site or give to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. 
  * E-mail Communications: To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from NextTen if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences.

### What About Cookies?

|   
  
  * Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are sent to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable systems to recognize your browser. These cookies help us identify return visitor volume but do not store any personal information about the user. 
  * The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of NextTen's coolest features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on.

### Does NextTen Share the Information It Receives?

|   
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries NextTen, Inc. We follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.  
  
---  
  
  * Agents: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 
  * Promotional Offers: Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of NextTen customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences. 
  * Protection of NextTen and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of NextTen, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.
  * With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

  * It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. Click here for more information on how to sign off.
