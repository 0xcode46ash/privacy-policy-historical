**Collection of Information**  
Lucasfilm does not require that visitors reveal any personally identifying information in order to access our main Web site. Although information may be required to participate in certain promotions or activities or to purchase products offered through our Web site, participants are requested to provide information on a voluntary basis only.

Where appropriate, the option to allow us to share certain information with some of our promotional partners may also be provided. No information will be shared with outside parties unless you choose this option. 

You always have the right to unsubscribe from any mailing lists we may maintain, or to delete personally identifiable electronic information we have collected online about you or your children. Lucasfilm reserves the right to delete information or change its privacy policy at any time. 

**Children**  
We encourage parents and guardians to take an active role to protect the privacy of their children and to prevent inappropriate use of information about their children. Parents and guardians should instruct their children never to give out real names or any other identifying information over the Internet without first getting parental permission. If you are 12 or under, you must have your parent or guardian's permission to provide any information to Lucasfilm. Lucasfilm will remove any information provided online by children upon the request of the child or the parent or guardian. 

**Cookies**  
Cookies are small pieces of electronic information which a Web site can store on a visitor's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies allow Web site operators to "personalize" the site to match your individual preferences. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many major Web sites use them. You can choose to set your browser to notify you whenever you are sent a cookie. This gives you the option to decide whether or not to accept a cookie. We use cookies to help provide you with a better experience on our site. We never store personally identifiable information in a cookie. Sites linked to the Lucasfilm Web site may also send cookies to users. 

**Links**  
Lucasfilm may create links to the Web sites of other parties. Children 12 and under should get parental permission before linking to other sites. Sites that are not associated with or authorized by Lucasfilm may also have links leading to www.starwars.com. Lucasfilm cannot control any of these links and is not responsible for any content appearing on sites linked to or from Lucasfilm's site, or for any personal information gathered at those sites. 

**Data Integrity and Security**  
The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our visitors is of the utmost concern to us. We have and will continue to take reasonable measures to assure the accuracy of all information our visitors share with us. Our efforts include procedures designed to avoid any unauthorized access, alteration, misuse or disclosure of information.

**PARENTS:**

We are committed to protecting children's privacy. We developed this Web site to be an enjoyable experience for customers of all ages, including kids under 13. We recognize that some younger children may not understand some of the information contained on this Web site or how this Web site operates. PLEASE BE SURE TO CAUTION YOUR CHILD UNDER 13 AGAINST PROVIDING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ONLINE PRIOR TO THE WEB SITE OPERATOR OBTAINING YOUR CONSENT. It is our policy not to collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 without first obtaining a parent's or guardian's verifiable permission. See our "SPECIAL NOTE TO PARENTS OF KIDS UNDER 13" below. 

Please discuss this Privacy Policy with your children so that they will better understand how to use this Web site and the information they may be asked to provide. We strongly believe that providing our visitors with accurate and adequate notice about the Web site will lead to informed choices and decisions about how to use the Web site, as well as protecting our users' privacy. 

**WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**

Generally, we limit the collection of information to what is known as non-personally identifiable information (such as, first name, age, state or country) and we will not require you to provide more information than is necessary to participate in any of our Web site activities. This information is collected so that visitors can participate in activities (such as, receiving our e-mail newsletter[s], building homepages, saving game designs and scores, participating in our question polls) without giving out unnecessary personal information other than an e-mail address. 

However, in some areas on our Web site personally identifiable information is asked for and collected (for example, online sweepstakes, online promotions and the registered area of this site and you may not be able to access those areas or participate in certain activities without giving the necessary personal information. Where we request additional information from you in connection with a Web site's activity such information may be personal. Whenever we request that you submit such information, we will endeavor to notify you of our intended use of the information, as more specifically discussed below. PLEASE BE AWARE THAT YOU ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE, AND CAN DECLINE TO PROVIDE, ANY REQUESTED INFORMATION AT ANY TIME. HOWEVER, IF YOU DECLINE, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN CERTAIN ACTIVITIES AT THIS WEB SITE. 

The types of information collected at this Web site may include: 

  * Contact information, such as full name, e-mail address and mailing address.

  * Internet Protocol (IP) Information, such as your IP address and browser type. 
  * Information collected by or held in "cookies." 



**HOW DO WE USE INFORMATION?:**

**Registration:**

If this Web site has a registration procedure, our Web site's registration form requires users to give us contact information, unique identifiers, and demographic information. All registration information is submitted to us on a voluntary basis. We may also ask registered members to tell us how they found out about us. Once you register, we use customer contact information from the registration form to contact you, to send you information about our company and/or to give you updates on products and/or services. You may register on our Web site and choose not to receive information and updates by unchecking the relevant box on the registration form. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13, GET YOUR PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT BEFORE YOU PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION. 

**Online Promotions:**

We or our advertisers, licensees and/or other business partners may have special online promotions which feature products or services related to our business activities. TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY PROMOTION, YOU MUST 13 YEARS OR OLDER (unless otherwise specified by the promotion's rules and regulations). IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YOU WILL NEED YOUR PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT BEFORE YOU CAN PARTICIPATE IN THIS ACTIVITY. IF YOU ARE OVER 13 BUT NOT AN ADULT YOU WILL NEED YOUR PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT TO COLLECT YOUR PRIZE OR RECEIVE YOUR BENEFIT. You may be asked to provide an e-mail address or screen name, so that we can let you know if you won a prize. For other promotions, we may request your name and home address in order to send you products or information by regular mail. The specific rules and regulations governing the particular promotion will vary and your participation constitutes your agreement to abide by those rules and regulations. 

**Online Contests and Sweepstakes:**

We or our advertisers, licensees and/or other business partners may sponsor contests or sweepstakes which may be entered online. The specific rules and regulations governing the particular contest or sweepstakes will vary and your participation constitutes your agreement to abide by those rules and regulations.

We use return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail that we receive, and we may use return e-mail to communicate with you or to send you other information. If you are under 13 (with your parent's or guardian's consent), or if you are over 13 but not an adult, the information collected for contests or sweepstakes include your first name, e-mail address and your parent's e-mail address and, if you win, before your prize is collected, your parent or guardian is sent an e-mail informing them of your award and explaining the nature and terms and conditions of the sweepstakes.

**Collecting and Sharing Data:**

We sometimes collect information to find out how people found our Web site, which pages they visited, and how long they stayed. In addition, we may aggregate demographic, profile and non-personal information you provide and use aggregate information to better design our Web site and to improve our marketing strategy and our product offerings.

Our newsletters may include links to any independently-operated Web site. Although we do not provide without parental permission any personally identifiable information about kids under 13 to any "independently-operated Web site" (that is, a Web site not owned, controlled and operated by us), such Web Site(s) may solicit personally identifiable information from kids under 13, please be aware that we don't control and are not responsible for their actions, privacy policy(ies) or terms of use.

**Cookies:**

We use a software technology called "cookies" to collect non-personally identifiable information. Cookies are pieces of information that we may place on your computer to help "personalize" your visit to the Web site and to allow you to enter our Web site without having to remember and enter any special passwords. For example, a "cookie" will allow us to remember certain things about you, such as your screen name, to track visitor scores or to help you keep track of where you left off in a game. "Cookies" may include the type of browser software you use to access the Internet (i.e. Internet Explorer, Netscape 3.0,); type of operating system (i.e. Windows 95, Mac, etc.), and/or the domain name of your Internet service provider. Except with respect to our e-commerce activities (e.g., on-line purchases), we do not link your non-personally identifiable information in "cookies" with personally identifiable information about you. 

In addition, some companies place or provide banner ads on this Web site that might also place cookies. Each of these companies use this cookie information according to their own privacy and security policies. You can find and evaluate these companies at the end of this Privacy Policy as 'Appendix A,' and we will keep this list updated. 

**Choice/Opt-In/Opt-Out:**

If you are over the age of 12 you could receive communications from us or from third parties. In that case, you may: (1) opt-out of receiving communications from us by selecting or deselecting the optional e-mail from us on the "Your Account" page to control the messages you receive from us; and/or (2) opt-in or opt-out of receiving communications from third-party sponsors or promotional partners at the time of registration. If you elect to receive these communications, we will transmit the information that you provide to this third party. Note, however, that each third party is governed by a different privacy policy and may have a different method than our Web site to opt-out of future communications. 

**IP Address and Machine Type:**

An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from our Web site, our servers log your IP address. An IP address does not contain personally identifiable information. Except with respect to our e-commerce activities (e.g., on-line purchases), we do not link IP addresses with personally identifiable information. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information. We may also collect information about your browser software and/or machine type (e.g., Windows, Mac, Unix, etc.). 

**Links:**

We do create links to the Web sites of other parties. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13, GET YOUR PARENT'S OR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT BEFORE LINKING TO OTHER WEB SITES. Independently-operated Web sites are not associated with or authorized by us and may also have links leading to this Web site. We cannot control any of these links and are not responsible for any content appearing on Web sites linked to or from our Web site, or for any personal information gathered at those independently-operated Web sites. 

**Bumper Pages:**

We sometimes provide a "bumper page" when linking from our Web site to an independently-operated Web site, which lets you know you are going to an independently-operated Web site and reminds them not to give out information online without their parent's permission. 

**Data Integrity and Security:**

We take reasonable precautions to keep your personal information secure. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. In cases where the information is not stored on separate computer servers, it is only accessible from specific computers within our control. We have and will continue to take reasonable measures to assure the security and accuracy of all information our visitors share with us. Our efforts include procedures designed to avoid any unauthorized access, alteration, misuse or disclosure of personally identifiable information. 

**CHANGES:**

**Our changes:**

We reserve the right to change or remove this privacy policy at our discretion. If we decide to change our privacy policy we will post those changes here. We encourage you to visit this area frequently to stay informed. We will tell you via e-mail if we make any material changes in how we collect, use or we wish to share your child's information in any manner not previously authorized by you. We will require third parties with whom we have written agreements involving the sharing of personally identifiable information of kids under 13 to agree to protect the privacy of that information in accordance with applicable law. 

**Your changes:**

This Web site gives users options for changing and modifying information previously provided. If you are a registered visitor, you are welcome to view, change or delete your registration information at any time, or to update the contact information we have for you or to inform us that you do not want to receive new product or other information from us. Simply go to the registration page of this Web site using the same computer from which you initially registered. When the welcome screen appears, you can click on "delete or add". Kids under 13 cannot change registration information, only the parent or guardian can do that. Parents should follow the procedure that they used to enable their child's registration to change any information at any time. 

**SPECIAL NOTE TO KIDS:**

If you are under 13 years old, ask your parent or guardian BEFORE giving out any information about yourself, such as your name, age, address or e-mail address. You do not have to give any personal information about yourself. Remember, if you are under 13 you must have your parent or guardian make any changes to information given to us in the past or to update your profile. If you are ever unsure about anything you are seeing on this Web site, ask your parent or guardian for help. 

If you are 13 years or older, you may have the ability to participate in online contests or sweepstakes, e-mail other users or post messages on portions of this Web site. In the event that you do post messages on this Web site, remember that other users of this Web site may have access to your e-mail address and user name. However, if you participate in online contests, sweepstakes or promotions, you cannot collect any prizes without your parent's or guardian's consent. 

**SPECIAL NOTE TO PARENTS OF KIDS UNDER 13:** We may collect the name of a child or parent and online contact information in order to obtain parental consent to parents of kids under 13 or to provide parental notice. If a visitor indicates that he/she is under the age of 13, he/she will be asked to supply a parent's or guardian's e-mail address. In this case, the parent or guardian will receive an e-mail message containing instructions on how to enable the child's registration and until the parent or guardian enables the child's registration, the account is disabled. If we do not receive the parent's or guardian's said consent within a reasonable time, we delete this information from our records. We also may collect this information to respond to a specific request from a child under 13. Once we respond to a request from a child under 13, we may not contact your child again and the information is deleted from our records. We take very seriously the safety of children, especially those under 13 and may also collect this information to protect that safety. If we do collect information to protect the safety of your child, we provide notice to you and we do not use that information for any other purpose. You can always ask us to review or delete any of your child's information at any time by sending us a written request at the Contact Information below and you can ask that we do not use or collect any more personal information from your child. However, if you ask us to delete your child's information that is necessary to participate in our activities, we may have to ask your child not to participate in our activities.
