Privacy Policy

Internet user privacy is of paramount importance to Star Magazine and our partners. The success of our business depends upon our ability to maintain the trust of our users. Below is information regarding Star Magazine's commitment to protect the privacy of users and to ensure the integrity of the Internet. 

**Information Collected in Ad Delivery**   
In the course of delivering an ad to you, Star Magazine, does not collect any personally-identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, phone number or email address. Star Magazine does, however, collect non-personally identifiable information about you, such as the server your computer is logged onto, your browser type (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer), and whether you responded to the ad delivered. 

The non-personally identifiable information collected by Star Magazine is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of Star Magazine' advertisers. 

There are also other cases when a user voluntarily provides personal information in response to an ad (a survey or purchase form, for example). In these situations, Star Magazine (or a third party engaged by Star Magazine) collects the information on behalf of the advertiser and/or Web site. This information is used by the advertiser and/or Star Magazine Web Site so that you can receive the goods, services or information that you requested. Where indicated, Star Magazine may use this information in aggregate form to get a better general understanding of the type of individuals viewing ads on the Web Site. Unless specifically disclosed, the personally-identifiable information collected by Star Magazine in these cases is not used to deliver personally-tailored ads to a user and is not linked by Star Magazine to any other information. 

**Sweepstakes**   
When you enter a Star Magazine sweepstakes, the information you provide is not be shared with any third party, unless you agree by checking the opt-in box on the sweepstakes entry form. If you enter a sweepstakes, you agree that the sweepstakes sponsor may use your name in relation to announcing and promoting the winners of the sweepstakes. See the official rules of the sweepstakes you are entering for additional information. 

Star Magazine does collect aggregate, anonymous information about the sweepstakes. That information is primarily used to help sweepstakes managers choose prizes and make other decisions regarding the organization of the sweepstakes. Star Magazine does not associate information provided through the sweepstakes with your other web browsing activities or clickstream data. 

**Information Collected by Star Magazine' Web Site**   
The Star Magazine Website may ask for and collect personally-identifiable information. Star Magazine is committed to providing meaningful notice and choice to users before any personally-identifiable information is submitted to us. Specifically, users will be informed about how Star Magazine may use such information, including whether it will be shared with marketing partners or combined with other information available to us. In most cases, the information provided by a user will be contributed a database to enable personally-tailored ad delivery online. Users will always be offered the choice not to provide personally-identifiable information or to have it shared with others. 

**Policy for Children Under the Age of 13**   
AMI sites are not intended for use by children. Children should not provide any personal information or use AMI's public areas, forums, and chats. AMI sites do not accept registrations or collect personally identifiable information from children due to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). [ COPPA](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/online/kidsprivacy.htm) was enacted to prevent websites from collecting and/or distributing information from children without their parents' consent. For more information on [ COPPA](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/online/kidsprivacy.htm), please refer to the [Federal Trade Commission](http://www.ftc.gov/) Website. 

**Access**   
Star Magazine offers users who have voluntarily provided personally-identifiable information to Star Magazine the opportunity to review the information provided and to correct any errors. 

**Cookies**   
Star Magazine, along with thousands of other Web sites, uses cookies to enhance your Web viewing experience. Star Magazine's cookies do not damage your system or files in any way. 

Here's how it works.

The cookie can help ensure that you do not see the same ad over and over again. Cookies can also help advertisers measure how you utilize an advertiser's site. This information helps our advertisers cater their ads to your needs. 

While we believe that cookies enhance your Web experience by limiting the repetitiveness of advertising and increasing the level of relevant content on the Web, they are not essential for us to continue our leadership position in Web advertising.
