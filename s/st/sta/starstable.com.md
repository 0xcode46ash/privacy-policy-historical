# Privacy Policy « Starstable.com

### Star Stable is a product owned and developed by Star Stable AB. All rights reserved.

In Star Stable your privacy is safe. None of your personal details will be shared or forwarded to any other person or company. Your personal information is kept private and we will never share it with other companies or other people without your permission. As long as you don’t break any of the rules (described in the terms and conditions) and laws (local, national or international), your privacy is safe in Star Stable; If you do, however, we might have to share your information with Legal Authorities.

The information we collect about you helps us to serve you better and allows us to get in touch with you.

You will be notified about changes on how all information you give us will be used and if, or how, it’ll be displayed in Star Stable. Some information is public so people can communicate with you and the rest is private.

NEVER share any personal information, in the game or in your profile details, if you are not TOTALLY sure and aware of that you want to show it to the world. This is your own responsibility, and please don’t take this lightly. Star Stable (and therefore Starstable AB) reserves the right to, but do not promise to, temporarily hide personal information posted by you while checking with you (or your parents if you are under 18) that it is really O.K.

**User data**

When a user under 13 registers at Starstable.com, Star Stable (and therefore Star Stable AB) asks the user for an email address (or parents or legal guardians email address) and a password. Paying members will be asked to submit further information, such as the user’s birthday, gender and country of residence. We ask for this information so we can provide access to our services.

**Posted Content**

The content you post in Star Stable is stored into our database and it is part of Star Stable content. However,it will not be published or used outside Star Stable without your consent. Star Stable AB reserves the right to delete inappropriate content or forward any illegal content to appropriate third parties and/or law enforcement.

**E-mail**

We may from time to time e-mail you with informative messages about services.

The newsletters may contain codes that enable our database to track your usage of the newsletters, including if the email was opened and/or what links (if any) were clicked. We can combine that information with other information we have about you to improve your site experience and/or provide customized communication to you.

If you forget your password by any chance you will not be able to retrieve a new one if you haven’t contributed a valid email address to us in advance. We therefore strongly recommend you to enter an email address.

**Game**

The game is monitored by authorized personal in order to maintain it a friendly and cheerful place. Whisper and private messages might be monitored by administrators although the content remains private. See the Terms and Conditions for more information.

**Password**

Your password is the master key to your account. So try to use a password that is hard to guess. And even though it might sound a bit obvious, we must remind you not to give it to anyone. We will NEVER ask you for your password so don’t be fooled by e-mails that do so. All passwords are encrypted and cannot be read by anyone.

**Security measures**

Star Stable (and therefore Star Stable AB) might keep logs of chat conversations and messages sent in order to keep the environment safe, cheerful and suitable for users of all ages. This means a chat free of bad language, sexual, violent and illegal content. Logs and user’s information are confidential and not shared with any third parties except when requested by law enforcement.

As a security measure, Star Stable (and therefore Star Stable AB) reserves the right to have its moderators and staff members to read and monitor “whispers” and private messages in Star Stable, although the content remains private (unless when requested to be disclosed by law enforcement agencies in the case of a crime investigation).

When a parent agrees with the registration of a child under 13, the parent also states that he/she has read, understood and agree with these Terms and Conditions of usage.

**IP Address**

An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a unique string of numbers, like a bar code or an ID, that your server and Internet Provider give to your computer. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. IP addresses are used only to help us find and fix problems with our server and to administer the site and to contact you. Your IP address may also be used to gather broad demographic information. But again, we will never share your IP address with anyone else unless requested by law enforcement.
