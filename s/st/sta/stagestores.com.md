## The Types of Information We Collect

### Aggregate Information

Our web server automatically collects the IP address, but not the email address, of all visitors to our Sites. We also track the pages within our Sites viewed by each visitor. Such information is aggregated with tracking data from all Site visitors. We use this aggregate information to help us evaluate visitor traffic patterns and improve our Sites by making it more responsive to the needs of visitors. This information does not identify you personally.

For example, we may collect IP address information from visitors to our website; we may also collect your name, address, telephone number, email address and other information when you register on our site or participate in a promotion; and we may collect name, contact and credit card information whenever you place an order on any Site. If you choose to complete the online Job Application Form, we will also ask for additional information regarding your employment preferences and history, your criminal record, educational background, and related information.

Comenity may re-disclose that information to us or other third parties, as stated in Comenity's Privacy Statement.

## Web Site Cookies

A cookie is a piece of information that a web server may place on your computer when you visit a Site. Cookies we use are commonly used by web sites to improve the user experience and have not been known by us to transmit computer viruses or otherwise harm your computer. Some cookies last only through a single web site session or visit, while others may have an expiration date, or may remain on your computer until you delete them.

We may use cookies for a number of purposes - for example, to maintain continuity during a user session, to gather data about the usage of a Site for research and other purposes, to store your preferences for certain kinds of information and marketing offers, or to store a user name or encrypted identification number so that you do not have to provide this information every time you return to a Site.

You can decide if and how your computer will accept a cookie by configuring your preferences or options in your browser. However, if you choose to reject cookies, you may not be able to use certain of our online products and services or Site features.

We may occasionally use other companies to set cookies on our Sites and gather cookie information for us. In some cases, we may also use another company to operate web servers for our Sites. We use the cookie information gathered by these companies in the same manner as stated above.

In some cases, we retain both the cookie information and/or the information you provide to us online - for example, to complete a transaction you requested or to keep historical records of your past transactions. In other cases - for example, when you use any of the tools offered on a Site - we only retain the cookie and/or online information you give us if you request us to do so for your use in subsequent sessions.

## How We Use the Information We Collect

We use aggregate information collected online to help us evaluate visitor traffic patterns and improve our Sites by making them more responsive to the needs of visitors. The personally identifiable information we collect online is also used to process requests or orders you make on a Site. For example, we use information you provide to help you purchase items, provide you with sales alerts, participate in surveys, and help us respond to your customer service comments and inquiries. We also use personally identifiable information we collect to contact you regarding our products and services that may be of interest to you. Visitors who do not wish to receive sales alerts and other promotional notifications may opt not to provide such information, take advantage of the opt-out procedures described in detail below, or at any time opt-out of receiving additional emails by using the opt-out mechanism included in all marketing emails. Additionally, should you choose to provide personal information through our online employment application process, the information you provide us may be used in order to make a determination with regard to employment.

## How We Share Information We Collect

In order to ensure that you have every opportunity to take advantage of the offers provided by us, our product suppliers, vendors and business partners, we may share the information you provide with other businesses or organizations for commercial purposes. For example, we may provide customer information to those partners who have offers relevant to the customers who provided the information. We may also disclose your information to companies that provide support services to us such as shippers when necessary to fulfill an order you have placed, printers or mailing houses that help us market our products or services, or web hosts or designers who help us create and maintain the Sites. We may also disclose your personal information when required by law, when such action is necessary to comply with a court order or legal process served on us. In the event one of our brands enters into a business transaction such as a merger, sale of assets, or acquisition by another company, personal information about visitors to our Sites may be transferred as part of our business assets.

## Choice/Opt-out

Visitors to our Site may be given the opportunity to choose whether to have their information used for certain purposes at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our check out process may provide an optionthat allows the visitor to choose to receive email notifications of upcoming sales and events.
