# ConneCT - Privacy Statement

  
**Privacy Notice \- **Version 1.0, October 10, 2000

* * *

Thank you for visiting ConneCT - the official web site for the State of Connecticut. ConneCT is committed to protecting your privacy and to making your on-line experience enjoyable, secure, comfortable, and valuable. This notice fully discloses our privacy policy and information practices. We describe in detail what user information we collect, how we use it and how we disclose it. You do not have to provide personal information to visit ConneCT web sites or download information.

ConneCT policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our website users, consistent with the applicable laws of the United States and the State of Connecticut, including the Connecticut Freedom of Information Act and the Connecticut Personal Data Act. We do not collect, use or disclose any information about our users without their knowledge and approval. We do not share user information with third parties unless we have informed users about the disclosures or when we have prior consent.

In addition, it is possible that ConneCT could be required to disclose personal information in response to valid legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order. All record keepers face the possibility that disclosure of their records may be compelled in some civil, criminal, or administrative matters. Disclosures may also be appropriate to protect ConneCT's legal rights or during emergencies if physical safety is believed to be at risk. We think that these events are unlikely, but they are possible.

**Policy Revision and Notification of Changes**

ConneCT will update this policy from time to time as we add new services and new features. We will tell our users about changes in this policy by making changes on this page, which will always contain a version number and date, making it easy to see when changes have taken place. Any information collected under this current policy will remain subject to the terms of the privacy policy. After any changes take effect, all new information collected, if any, will be subject to the revised privacy policy.

**What Information About Users Does The State Of Connecticut Collect?**

**Automatic Information**

The following information is collected and stored automatically from all users accessing the ConneCT web sites to browse or download information:

  * The Internet domain and Internet Protocol address from which you access our site;
  * The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;
  * The date and time you access our site;
  * The pages you visit; and
  * If you linked to ConneCT from another website, the address of that website.



This information is used to create summary statistics, which are used for purposes such as assessing what information is of most interest to users, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas.

This information is not reported or used in any manner that would reveal personally identifiable information and will not be released to any outside (third) parties unless legally required to do so.

**Personal Information You Provide to Us**

ConneCT does not obtain personally identifiable information about you when you visit our web sites unless you choose to provide such information to us (i.e. sending an e-mail, participating in a survey, responding to a feedback or "contact us" form, etc.)

We consider any information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally as personally identifying information. This includes, but is not limited to:

  * Your name
  * Your address
  * Your e-mail address
  * Your Social Security number
  * Your password
  * Bank account information
  * Credit card information
  * Any combination of data that could be used to identify you such as your birth date, your zip code and your gender.



Government agencies may request personally identifiable information from you in order to provide requested services, but such information is handled as it would be on an in-person visit to a government office.

If personal information is requested on the web site or volunteered by the user, state law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information is a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by federal or state law.

**E-Mail Communications and Web Forms**

If you send us an electronic mail message with a question or comment that contains personally identifying information, or fill out a form that e-mails us information, we will only use this personally identifying information to respond to your request and analyze trends. We may redirect your message to another government agency or person who is in a better position to answer your question .

All e-mail addresses collected by ConneCT contain the names of people who voluntarily communicated with or requested information from us. E-mail addresses are not sold, leased or shared with any governmental or commercial entities. When a user has given us his/her e-mail address for purposes of communicating with or requesting information from ConneCT, that communication becomes part of the public record and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by federal or state law.

**Does ConneCT use Cookies?**

We do not use cookies to collect information on the ConneCT site. NOTE: A cookie file is a text file, not an executable program, which is sent from a web server to the user's machine when the user's browser accesses the server's site. The server cannot find out your name or e-mail address, or anything about your computer using cookies. Cookies can only tell a web server if you have been there before and can pass short bits of information from the web server back to itself the next time you visit.

**Does The State Of Connecticut Share The Information It Receives With Anyone?**

ConneCT believes the service we provide to our users should make their lives easier, without the fear that their personal data will end up in the wrong hands. Except as provided by applicable state and federal laws, we do not collect, use or disclose any information about our users without their knowledge and approval. We do not share user information with third parties unless we have informed users about the disclosures or when we have prior consent.

In addition, this privacy policy describes the basic data disclosures that we make with our contractors in order to support our core functions and features. Our contractors comply with the same strict limits on use and disclosure of user data. Our website partners may have different use and disclosure policies.

**Contractors**

ConneCT may contract with other companies to assist in supporting our core features and functions. When necessary for these services to function, we exchange user information with these companies or those users who have selected those services. We require that our contractors treat our users' data under the same high privacy, security and fair information practices standards that ConneCT uses. Personal data provided to our contractors are not sold, rented, or shared by them except as necessary to accomplish the purpose of the disclosure. It also means that our contractors will not use personal data for marketing to our users.

**Partners**

Some users of ConneCT may come to us through web sites that we may co-sponsor with other web companies or through links to ConneCT provided at other web sites. These other sites are our website partners. We do not share user information with website partners unless a user tells us to do so. Once a user directs us to send information to a website partner, the information in the partner's possession becomes subject to the website partner's privacy policies and practices, which may differ from ConneCT's policies and practices. At ConneCT, we will continue to protect user information in accordance with this privacy policy. ConneCT makes no representations or warranties about, and has no liability or responsibility toward its users in connection with, our website partners or their privacy policies. We urge users to read the privacy policy of any website before providing any personal information.

**Can I Access, Edit and Correct My Personal Information?**

Because the ConneCT site does not collect any personally identifiable information other than what you provide us in your e-mail correspondence and because we do not match any of that personally identifiable information with any of the automatic data that we do record, we generally cannot identify, and therefore, cannot provide any information about your visit to ConneCT.

However, we recognize many concerns people have with regard to public records that include information about them, including the right to correct inaccurate information. Consequently, persons concerned with regard to information about them should contact the custodian of the record, which typically is the state agency or other governmental entity that collects and maintains the information.

**Do I Have a Choice About Whether or Not My Personal Information is Provided to Others?**

ConneCT does not obtain personally identifiable information about you when you visit our web sites unless you choose to provide such information to us (i.e. sending an e-mail, participating in a survey, responding to a feedback or "contact us" form, etc.). We do not  
disclose, sell, lease or provide any personal information about our users to any other government or commercial entity for any purpose.

There may be instances where we send ongoing updates or announcements to interested parties. In such cases, visitors will have the choice whether or not to receive these updates or announcements.

However, it is important to understand that, under applicable state and federal law, various forms of correspondence and other communications, i.e. comments concerning web sites, state government programs and processes, policies, activities and other types of general correspondence may be subject to public disclosure.

**Commitment to Security**

The Department of Information Technology, which manages the computing infrastructure to support ConneCT, understands the value of and our dependency on the data, information, and computer systems used in serving the needs of our users. As a part of it's everyday operations, the Department of Information Technology has put into place appropriate safeguards to insure that any personal information and technical infrastructures are secure from destruction, corruption, unauthorized access and breach of confidentiality whether accidental or deliberate. This includes ongoing review and implementation of security measures and plans, the use of new technology when available and appropriate, and regular training for their personnel.

**Disclaimer/Links to other Sites**

ConneCT contains links to other web sites. These may include links to web sites operated by other government agencies, non-profit organizations and private businesses. When you link to another site, you are no longer on the ConneCT web site and this privacy notice does not apply. When you link to another web site, you are subject to the privacy policy of that web site.
