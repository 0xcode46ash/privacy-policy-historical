**SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION.** We may share your personal information in the instances described below. For further information on your choices regarding your information, see the “Your Choices About Your Information” section below.

Remember, our Service allows you to connect with others and share information about yourself with other individuals and organizations. In some instances, your profile information, including your name, photo, and other personal information, will be available publicly to other members of the Service by default and may be searchable by search engines which may display a certain amount of your information publicly. You may be able to adjust your profile settings to entirely prevent the general public from viewing your profile, though it will remain visible to other Users of the Service. Also, remember that organizations and other third parties that use Stack Sports Services may have their own data collection and use policies that Stack Sports does not control, even in situations where Stack Sports may access or maintain such data on behalf of the organization. Please review the privacy policies of any third party organization before sharing your personal information with that organization.

We may also share your personal information with:

  * Other companies owned by or under common ownership at Stack Sports. These companies will use your personal information in the same way as we can under this policy;
  * Third-party vendors and other service providers that perform services on our behalf, as needed to carry out their work for us, which may include identifying and serving targeted advertisements, billing, payment processing, content or service fulfillment, or providing analytic services;
  * Trusted business partners who may use your information to contact you about opportunities that may be of interest to you.
  * Other Users of the Stack Sports Service. Your information, including both information you provide and information we have collected about you from other Users, may be searchable by or made available to other Users of the Service. These Users may contact you via email or, with your consent, via text messages. Once your information has been shared with another User of the Service, that User may use and maintain copies of your information outside of the Service. You may be able to control some elements of data sharing through your settings.
  * To Persons with Authority. Certain Stack Sports Services connect to colleges and universities. As such, Stack Sports may disclose your personal information directly or via a third party to colleges and universities that you have indicated you are interested in attending, as well as to other accredited colleges and universities that Stack Sports and/or our business partners believe may be of interest to you.
  * Certain Stack Sports Services connect to the public. Any information that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service is viewable by other Users and the public. As one example, a tournament director may print a list of athletes at an event and distribute that list to tournament attendees who may or may not be members of the Service.
  * Other parties in connection with a company transaction, such as a merger, sale of company assets or shares, reorganization, financing, change of control or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company or third party or in the event of a bankruptcy or related or similar proceedings; and
  * Third parties as required by law or subpoena or otherwise if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use http://stacksports.com/termsofuse or to protect the security or integrity of our Service; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Stack Sports, our Users, or others.
  * We may also aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally identifying characteristics and may share that aggregated, anonymized data with third parties.

If you have any questions about modifying your account information or changing your communication preferences, you can contact us directly at [info@stacksports.com](mailto:info@stacksports.com)

**Privacy Settings:** Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any information that you make public is searchable by other Users and may be accessible via API(s) and viewable on search engines. You may be able to restrict some of this public sharing by changing your profile privacy settings on the Service or by limiting the type of data in your profile. Changing your privacy settings will not have any effect on information that was previously shared through the Service. Remember that even if you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved that information.

Certain information is not searchable or viewable to other Users. This can include: analytics information about your performance on the website, notes you make on your profile, ratings you give to other Users, your lists of other Users and non-Users, and messages you send and receive.

**How long we keep your Information:** Following termination or deactivation of your User account, Stack Sports may retain your profile information for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, or audit purposes. Please contact us at info@stacksports.com if you wish to delete your account. In some instances, we may not be able to delete all of your content but we will inform you of the reason.

Please be aware that we will not be able to delete any content you have shared with others on the Service or with social media sites. Please also be aware that we may be able to delete data that you provided to the Service about yourself or others, but we may not be able to delete data about you that was provided by another User, such as a coach or tournament director. By way of example, if a coach or another Person with Authority adds a User’s information to a team roster or a college coach adds a recruit to the college coach’s list, that information cannot be deleted by the User once it has been shared or entered by the coach.

**6\. HOW WE STORE AND PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION**

**Storage and Processing:** Your information collected through a Stack Sports Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Stack Sports or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which Stack Sports or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Keeping your information safe:** Stack Sports cares about the security of your information, and uses commercially reasonable physical, administrative, and technological safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through the Stack Sports Services. However, no security system is impenetrable and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems. In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Stack Sports will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.

The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires us to inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under the age of 13. It also requires that we obtain parental consent before we allow children under the age of 13 to use certain Stack Sports Services.

Based on the sensitivity of children’s privacy, Stack Sports has a separate policy specifically focused on the issue. Please see: <http://stacksports.com/legal-COPPA/>

We are not responsible for the practices employed by third party websites or services embedded in, linked to, or linked from the Service and your interactions with any third-party website or service are subject to that third party’s own rules and policies. In addition, you agree that we are not responsible for and we do not have any control over any third-parties that you authorize to access your information, including the organizations you interact with on our Service.
