# StayClassy | Privacy Policy and Terms

Stay Classy, Inc. takes privacy very seriously. Please read through our Privacy Policy to understand how it pertains to you as you use our website services.

Displaying Your Information

* * *

As you sign-up to become a StayClassy.org member, you are asked for personal information (i.e. name, age, location, etc.), some of which is used to build a member profile; however, it is you who decides how much information other members can see in your member profile. You can manage these privacy controls through the "Privacy Settings" button in your profile. The default setting is that only Stay Classy members will be able to see your profile. You can change your privacy so that only people in your social network can see your profile, or you can make yourself entirely private to all. 

There may be occasions where you will use our E-Commerce system to purchase tickets to an event, merchandise, or other goods and services we may provide. In these cases, you will be asked to enter a home address and credit/debit card information. Stay Classy will never display this information publicly on our website, nor will Stay Classy provide your credit card number to any outside parties. Your transaction is conducted on a secure server using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts all of the information you input (to learn more about SSL technology, [click here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer)). This information is only viewable by you, and is found in your personal profile under "Account Settings". 

We have ensured that our partner, The Stay Classy Foundation, also follows these same guidelines when processing donations. Additionally, if you make a donation through the Stay Classy Foundation, your transaction information is shared with StayClassy.org in order to make it viewable in your personal profile (provided that you are a StayClassy.org member and entered the Foundation's website through StayClassy.org).   


Sharing Information with Third Parties

* * *

Stay Classy, Inc. will never give your personal information out to a third party without your knowledge. However, there are three scenarios where Stay Classy will use your personal information to fulfill business or legal objectives. The following apply:

1) We may provide information to trusted partners who work on behalf or with Stay Classy under confidentiality agreements. An example of this includes our email marketing partner, who assists us in creating and distributing our monthly newsletter and other promotional emails you may receive. 

2) We may provide information to certain legal authorities if we feel, in good faith, the law requires it. 

3) We may use aggregated user statistics to describe our business and services to prospective partners, investors, and advertisers. An example of an aggregated statistic includes, "X% of our users live in Southern California". 

Stay Classy will never sell or distribute your email address without your explicit permission.   


Links

* * *

StayClassy.org may contain links to other websites posted by us, or by our member community. Stay Classy is not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of these linked websites. 

People under age 18

* * *

StayClassy.org is intended for a professional and mature audience. People under the age of 18 (minors), are restricted from creating a user account and hence using any of the member services provided on our website. Stay Classy does not knowingly collect or solicit information from anyone under the age of 18, or knowingly allow such persons to register for an account. In the event that we find information on our website belonging to a person under the age of 18, we will remove this information immediately. If you believe that we have information on our website belonging to someone who is under 18, please contact us at info@stayclassy.org. 

People between ages 18 and 21

* * *

Stay Classy does not knowingly allow members who are under the age of 21 to purchase tickets to events that are exclusive to audiences who are 21 years of age and above. Every event of this nature will be clearly labeled as such. If a member who is under the age of 21, and has entered the correct birth date in his member information, attempts to purchase a ticket to a "21 and up" event, their transaction will be blocked and terminated immediately. Additionally, Stay Classy will be notified of the attempted purchase.

Event Pictures and Videos

* * *

StayClassy.org contains an extensive database of viewable picture and videos. We upload selected pictures from our events and post them onto our website. Any of our members are allowed to view the pictures and videos that Stay Classy uploads for each event. 

Additionally, members are able to upload pictures and video into the past event page on our website for viewing and commenting. Stay Classy does not knowingly allow members who did not attend an event, to view pictures and video uploaded by the member community for that particular event. The "past event" page for any event is exclusive to the members who attended the event.
