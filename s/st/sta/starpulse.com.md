**Starpulse.com Privacy Policy**

Starpulse.com's (SP) policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it. Using the Internet should be a fun experience and we want to help you make it so. The information you provide for suggestions, comments and sweepstakes registration is kept solely within SP. 

We will not disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent. SP may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) SP's rights or property, other SP users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. SP may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. 

SP shares aggregate information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. For example, we will say SP audience is x percent females and y percent males. This data is used to customize SP content and advertising to deliver a better experience for our users. 

There are cases where SP may ask you for personal information such as your name, email address, and birth date. For example, we request personal information when you register for a sweepstakes, newsletter or when making a comment. SP needs to collect this information for fulfilling prizes, tracking/verifying compliance with SP policies as well as federal, state and local laws and/or for editorial and feedback solicitation purposes.

In case you change your mind or some personal information may change (such as your zip code), we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us. You can do this by contacting us at [info@starpulse.com](mailto:info@starpulse.com). SP works with a third party that servers ads to this site. To find out more about how flycast manages the privacy of information in conjunction with serving ads on this site, please go to <http://www.flycast.com/about_us/about-privacy.html>.
