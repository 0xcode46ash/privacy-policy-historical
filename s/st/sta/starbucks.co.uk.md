**1\. Information We Collect**

As you use our websites or applications, we collect certain information about you and the services you use. The information we collect falls into three different categories: (1) information you give us; (2) information we collect from you automatically when you use our services; and (3) information we collect from other sources.

**Information You Give Us**

We collect information you give us when you use our services. Some examples of using our "services" are when you make a purchase at one of our stores, visit or make a purchase via one of our websites, create a Starbucks account, buy or send a gift certificate or e-gift online, download and install one of our mobile applications or participate in a survey or promotion.

**4\. How We May Allow Others to Collect Your Information**

When you use our websites or applications, we may allow third parties to collect information about you through cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies. Read more about cookies, web beacons and similar technologies. The information collected by third parties may include the type of device, your operating system, your browser, your internet service provider, your domain name, your internet protocol (IP) address, your device identifier (or UDID), the website that referred you to our website, the web pages you view (including the date and time you viewed them), the services or functionality you access or use (including the date and time of your access or use) and the subject of the ads you click or scroll over. 

We allow third parties to collect this information on our websites for the following purposes:

**To Display Ads for Products or Services** – We allow some advertising companies to collect this information in order to display ads on our websites that are most relevant to you. These third parties may also collect anonymous information about visitors to our websites to place them into market segments to display ads on other websites believed to be relevant to each market segment. This is known as "online behavioral advertising." Please see "Your Choices" below for more information about opting out of these targeted display ads and controlling the use of cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies.

**To Collect Information on How Our Websites and Applications Are Used** – We allow certain service providers to collect this information to help us understand how our websites and applications are used and to assist us in improving the content and operation of our online properties. These service providers collect aggregate statistical usage data that is not matched or linked to any individual user.

**To Make the Services of Other Companies Work** – We allow companies to implement cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies to enhance the operation of particular services and functionality of our websites or applications. For example, we allow Adobe to set and enable special cookies that are necessary to deliver video content for Adobe Flash Player. These cookies are called Flash cookies. 

**To Link Your Activity to Your Social Networks** – We have added certain features to our websites and applications that allow social networks (such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google+) to track the activities of their members or collect certain information when they use our website or applications. These features may include technologies called “plug-ins” and “widgets.” Plug-ins create a direct link between two websites, and widgets are interactive mini-programs that provide other companies’ services on our websites. If you are concerned about the way a social network is tracking your activity, please contact the social network or review its privacy policy. For example, you can review Facebook’s data-use policy at [https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/.](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/)

**5\. Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Technologies**

We and others may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and your use of our websites and applications. These technologies include cookies, web beacons, java scripts, entity tags and HTML local storage. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of these technologies in certain circumstances or altogether. For more information about changing your browser settings, please see the section of this Statement titled "Your Choices."

**Cookies** – Cookies are small data files that are sent from a website’s server and are stored on your device’s hard drive either for the duration of your visit (“session cookies”) or for a fixed period of time (“persistent cookies”). Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server. 

**Web Beacons** – Web beacons are small, transparent images that are embedded in web pages, applications, and emails that are sometimes called “clear gifs,” “single pixel gifs”, ”page tags” or “web bugs.” We use web beacons to track the web pages you visit, to test the effectiveness of our marketing, and to find out if an email has been opened and acted on.

**Java Scripts** – Java scripts are code snippets embedded in various parts of websites and applications that facilitate a variety of operations including accelerating the refresh speed of certain functionality or monitoring usage of various online components.

**Entity Tags** \-- Entity Tags are HTTP code mechanisms that allow portions of websites to be stored or “cached” within your browser and validates these caches when the website is opened, accelerating website performance since the web server does not need to send a full response if the content has not changed.

**HTML5 Local Storage** – HTML5 local storage allows named key/value pairs from websites to be stored or “cached” within your browser in order to store and retrieve data in HTML5 pages when the website is revisited.

These technologies are used mainly for the following purposes:

**Services and Functionality** – Some of these technologies are required to allow you to access or use our websites or mobile applications and the various services and functionality we offer. Without these technologies, some of the services and functionality we make available on our websites and mobile applications would not work properly.

**Performance Monitoring** – Some of these technologies help us analyse and estimate traffic and assess the volume of use of services and functionality on websites and mobile applications. They show us how visitors and users interact with our digital properties, whether there are any errors, the degree to which certain web pages, applications, services or functionality are accessed and used and how they are performing or operating. When these technologies are used for performance monitoring, no information that could identify you is collected.

**User Convenience** – Some of these technologies enhance the ease of use of our websites and mobile applications and the services and functionality they make available by accelerating load and refresh times and remembering information that you have provided on prior visits to our websites or when you last used a particular website or mobile application service or functionality.

**Marketing** – Some of these technologies are used to tailor your experience on our website or within our mobile applications by controlling the promotions, advertisements and other marketing messages that may appear when you access or use these digital properties. These technologies also help us learn which services and functionality you are using and how you are accessing information about us. We may use this information to personalize your visit to a website or use of a mobile application and to send you relevant promotions and advertisements.

**6\. Your Choices**

**Promotional Communication Choices**

You can opt out of receiving promotional emails, text messages, telephone calls, and mailings by informing us of your preference at the time you sign up for a Starbucks account, modifying your promotional preferences online in your account’s profile management section or by following the opt-out instructions in the promotional emails we send you. Where our mobile applications allows for the delivery of “push notifications” you can also opt out of receiving these notifications by toggling the “Push Notifications” switches within our mobile applications to "off." 

Alternatively, you may let us know that you do not wish to receive some or all of these promotional communications by emailing us at [ukinfo@starbucks.com](mailto:ukinfo@starbucks.com), calling us at 020 8834 5050 or by writing to us at Starbucks Customer Care, Starbucks Coffee Company, Building 4 Chiswick Park, 566 Chiswick High Road, London, W4 5YE. Please note that if you opt out of receiving promotional communications from us, we may still send you non-promotional communications, including emails about your accounts, purchases or franchise applications.

**Information Collection Choices**

**Location Information** – You can adjust the settings of your computer, tablet, smart phone or other device so that information about your physical location is not communicated by (a) disabling “location services” within the device settings; or (b) denying certain websites or mobile applications permission to access location information by changing the relevant preferences and permissions in your mobile device. 

**Use of Cookies** – As required, we offer the option to reject the use of cookies when you first access our websites. If you do not reject the use of cookies at this time, your continued use of the website will be treated as consent to the use of cookies. If you reject the use of cookies at this time, we will not set any further cookies on your device, except those required to allow you to access or use our websites or mobile applications and the various services and functionality we offer.

**Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Technologies** –-You may reject the use of most cookies, web beacons, entity tags and HTML5 local storage by adjusting the appropriate settings in your browser. Each browser is a little different, but the most common browsers (Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) have preferences or options that may be adjusted so the browser notifies you if a website wants to set or install a cookie or similar technology and allows you to either accept or reject the cookie or other technology before it is set or installed or allows you to remove or reject the use or installation of these technologies altogether. If you want to learn the correct way to modify your browser settings, please use the Help menu in your browser.

**Java Scripts** – As with cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, most browsers allow you to reject the use of java scripts by adjusting the appropriate browser settings. Again each browser is a little different, but most allow java scripts to either be accepted or rejected.

**Flash Player Technology** \-- We allow Adobe to set and enable special cookies and java scripts associated with the delivery of video content for Adobe Flash Player. While Flash cookies and java scripts cannot be removed by changing the browser settings, you can limit the websites that can deploy Flash cookies and java scripts on your device by visiting the Adobe website: <http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer>.

**DAA and NAI Opt Outs** \--In addition to adjusting the appropriate settings in your browser, many advertising companies that may collect anonymous information for advertisement targeting purposes are also members of the Digital Advertising Alliance or the Network Advertising Initiative, both of which provide an opt-out of advertisement targeting from their members located at their respective websites at <http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/> and <http://www.networkadvertising.org/>.

**“Do Not Track” Technology** – Some newer web browsers have a “Do Not Track” preference that transmits a “Do Not Track” header to the websites you visit with information indicating that you do not want your activity to be tracked. We currently do not respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals. 

**7\. Accessing or Changing Your Information or Deleting Your Account**

You have the right, under Section 7 of the Data Protection Act 1998 ("the Act"), to access information we hold about you by writing to us at [ukinfo@starbucks.com](mailto:ukinfo@starbucks.com) or by postal mail at Starbucks Customer Care, Starbucks Coffee Company, Building 4 Chiswick Park, 566 Chiswick High Road, London, W4 5YE. Any such access request may be subject to a small statutory fee to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.

If you want to change your information, cancel your account, or stop us from using your information, please contact us as described in the “Contact Us” section, below. We will make every effort to promptly respond to your request. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you ask us to delete your account, we generally retain and use your account information only as long as necessary to fulfil a business or law enforcement need.

**8\. How We Protect Your Information**

Starbucks protects your information using technical, physical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of your information in accordance with the Act. Some of our safeguards include firewalls, data encryption, physical access controls, and administrative informational controls. When you transmit highly sensitive information (such as a credit card number) through our websites or via our mobile applications, we encrypt the transmission of that information using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. While we have employed security technologies and procedures to assist safeguarding your personal information, no system or network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

**9\. Storing and Processing Your Information**

The information you provide us is stored and processed on servers owned or controlled by Starbucks and other companies in the United States and the United Kingdom.

The United States is one of the countries that provide less protection than countries in the EEA. Regardless of the company or person who processes your information and where it is processed, we will take steps to protect your information in accordance with applicable data protection laws and this Statement.
