### What information do we collect, and how?

We may collect certain identifying information from or about you in connection with your use of or submissions to the Site, including, but not limited to, your name, address, date of birth, email addresses, health information, health plan ("Plan") information and credit card number (together, "Collected Information"). Any health information about you will be collected in the course of providing services to you via the Site and telephone consultations. Our use of such health information is governed by our Notice of Privacy Practices. In addition, we may retain the content of, and metadata regarding, any correspondence you may have with us or our representatives, regardless of the mode of communication by which such correspondence was made. This information helps us to improve the Site and the online content, materials, and services that we make available on the Site, and to more effectively and efficiently respond to both current and future inquiries.

As with many other websites, the web servers used to operate the Site may collect certain data pertaining to you and the equipment and communications method that you use to access the Internet and our Site. For security reasons and to confirm the integrity of the Site, we may combine components of these data with Collected Information, which may identify you. Unless otherwise described in this Privacy Policy or our Terms and Conditions of Use, such identifying information will be used solely for our business purposes. In addition, the information we collect may reveal such things as the Internet protocol ("IP") address assigned to your computer, specific pages that you accessed on the Site or prior to visiting the Site, and the length of time you spent at the Site. We may use this information to help administer the Site and the servers that provide the Site, generate statistical information, monitor and analyze Site traffic and usage patterns, and improve the Site's content and content delivery, including any online content, materials, and services that we describe or make available on the Site.

In addition, our Site may send one or more "cookies" to your computer to improve the utility of the Site by storing user preferences and tracking user trends. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Please note that you may not be able to access the full functionality of our Site if cookies are disabled on your browser.

The use of cookies by our affiliates and service providers is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our affiliates and service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site, in order for you to find services available in your area, and facilitate our marketing efforts.

Our third party partners employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts that help them better manage content on our site. We do not tie the information gathered to our Customers' or Users' personally identifiable information.

We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking [Here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Analyte. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any Web site you visit.

Our Web site includes widgets, such as Google Maps and embedded video players. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

In addition, our Site may use a third party web analytics service. These features may record mouse clicks, mouse movements, and scrolling activity as you navigate through the website. This Site does not use the feature to collect any personally identifiable information entered in this website or have the ability to view personally identifiable or health information. Furthermore, we do not track your browsing habits across websites we do not own. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. You can choose to disable the Service here.

Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at info@apgservices.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

### How will we use the information you provide us?

In addition to the uses described above or in our Terms and Conditions of Use, we may use the information that we collect from or about you to analyze and improve the content, materials and services that we make available on the Site, to notify you of changes made to the Site, to evaluate user needs and customize the Site content delivered to you according to those needs, to send you promotional materials that you request from us, and for other legitimate and lawful business purposes. If you contact us for support or assistance, we may use information about you or your system that you provide or that we collect for purposes such as verifying whether your system meets the minimum requirements needed to use the Site and our various services. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We may store Collected Information in the United States, or we may transfer it to other countries.

### With whom do we share the information we collect?

We may share Collected Information with our authorized agents in order to provide services to you, and for any other lawful business reasons. If all or part of Analyte is sold, merged, or otherwise transferred to another entity, we may transfer Collected Information to such entity as part of that transaction. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

We may disclose Collected Information to the proper authorities if we become subject to a subpoena or court order or if we are otherwise legally required to disclose such information. We may also use and disclose information about you to establish or exercise our legal rights, to enforce the Terms and Conditions of Use, to assert and defend against legal claims, or if we believe such disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding actual or suspected illegal or fraudulent activities or potential threats to the physical safety or well-being of any person.

We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as permitted by law and only as necessary to provide these services to us.

### What choices do you have?

When corresponding with Analyte or our representatives, or when making a request for information or otherwise interacting with us or others through the Site, you choose what information to supply, what questions or comments to submit, whether you wish to receive further information, and by what method of communication such information should be delivered. Please take care to share only such information as is needed or that you believe is appropriate. You are under no obligation to provide us with personally identifiable information, but without it we may not be able to provide you the products or services you request. You may contact us as indicated below if at any time you would like to ask us about our data collection practices and our information security policy.

If your personally identifiable information ("PII") changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend your PII, delete inaccuracies or deactivate your web accessible account by calling us at 866.660.2593.

### How do we protect information collected about you?

Analyte maintains certain commercially reasonable security measures to protect Collected Information, both during transmission and once we receive it. When you enter sensitive information on our site, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). However, the storage and communication of Collected Information can never be completely secure. Hence we do not guarantee that information that you transmit or otherwise supply to us, or any communications conducted on or through the Site, is or will be totally secure. If you become aware of any breach of Site security, this Privacy Policy, or the Terms and Conditions of Use, please notify us immediately.

From time to time, we may change our privacy practices and this Privacy Policy, because of changes in relevant and applicable legal or regulatory requirements, our business practices, or in our attempts to better serve your needs and those of our other customers. Notice of such changes to our privacy practices will be given prior to their effect, sent to the e-mail address specified in your account or by means of a notice on this Site and a revised Privacy Policy will be posted on the Site.

### Our commitment to your privacy

In addition to this Privacy Policy, Analyte provides a Notice of Privacy Practices to everyone who becomes a patient of Analyte through this site. This Notice, sometimes referred to as a "HIPAA Notice," describes how health information about you may be used and disclosed and how you can get access to this information. In this Notice, we describe the ways that we may use and disclose health information about our patients. This Notice describes your rights as our patient and our obligations regarding the use and disclosure of Personal Health Information (PHI). We encourage you to read this Notice and know your rights.
