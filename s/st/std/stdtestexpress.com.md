We take your privacy very seriously. We believe in protecting your information in the same way we want ours protected. We at Analyte Physicians Group, S.C. and its authorized agents ("APG Services," "we" or "us"), encourage you to become familiar with this Privacy Policy and our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-service/ "terms of use").

This Privacy Policy describes what information we collect about you, how we collect it, how we use it, with whom we may share it, and what choices you have regarding it. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is a part of the Terms of Use of our website (the "Site"). We encourage you to become familiar with this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. By accessing and using the Site, you agree that you have read and understand this Privacy Policy and that you accept and consent to the privacy practices (and any uses and disclosures of information about you) that are described in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected at this Site. It does not apply to any other websites. We are not responsible for, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to, the privacy practices of those other websites. We encourage you to seek out and read the privacy policy of each website that you visit.

### What information do we collect, and how?

We may collect certain identifying information from or about you in connection with your use of or submissions to the Site, including, but not limited to, your name, address, date of birth, email addresses, medical information, and credit card number (together, "Collected Information"). Any medical information about you will be collected in the course of providing services to you via the Site and telephone consultations. Our use of such medical information is governed by our Notice of Privacy Practices. In addition, we may retain the content of, and metadata regarding, any correspondence you may have with us or our representatives, regardless of the mode of communication by which such correspondence was made. This information helps us to improve the Site and the online content, materials, and services that we make available on the Site, and to more effectively and efficiently respond to both current and future inquiries.

As with many other websites, the web servers used to operate the Site may collect certain data pertaining to you and the equipment and communications method that you use to access the Internet and our Site. For security reasons and to confirm the integrity of the Site, we may combine components of these data with Collected Information, which may identify you. Unless otherwise described in this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use, such identifying information will be used solely for our business purposes. In addition, the information we collect may reveal such things as the Internet protocol ("IP") address assigned to your computer, specific pages that you accessed on the Site or prior to visiting the Site, and the length of time you spent at the Site. We may use this information to help administer the Site and the servers that provide the Site, generate statistical information, monitor and analyze Site traffic and usage patterns, and improve the Site’s content and content delivery, including any online content, materials, and services that we describe or make available on the Site.

In addition, our Site may send one or more "cookies" to your computer to improve the utility of the Site by storing user preferences and tracking user trends. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Please note that you may not be able to access the full functionality of our Site if cookies are disabled on your browser.

### How will we use the information you provide us?

In addition to the uses described above or in our Terms of Use, we may use the information that we collect from or about you to analyze and improve the content, materials and services that we make available on the Site, to notify you of changes made to the Site, to evaluate user needs and customize the Site content delivered to you according to those needs, to send you promotional materials that you request from us, and for other legitimate and lawful business purposes. If you contact us for support or assistance, we may use information about you or your system that you provide or that we collect for purposes such as verifying whether your system meets the minimum requirements needed to use the Site and our various services.

We may store Collected Information for as long as needed for the purposes indicated in this Privacy Policy, which may be indefinitely. We may store Collected Information in the United States, or we may transfer it to other countries.

### With whom do we share the information we collect?

We may share Collected Information with our authorized agents in order to provide services to you, and for any other lawful business reasons. If all or part of APG Services is sold, merged, or otherwise transferred to another entity, we may transfer Collected Information to such entity as part of that transaction.

We may disclose Collected Information to the proper authorities if we become subject to a subpoena or court order or if we are otherwise legally required to disclose such information. We may also use and disclose information about you to establish or exercise our legal rights, to enforce the Terms of Use, to assert and defend against legal claims, or if we believe such disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding actual or suspected illegal or fraudulent activities or potential threats to the physical safety or well-being of any person.

### What choices do you have?

When corresponding with APG Services or our representatives, or when making a request for information or otherwise interacting with us or others through the Site, you choose what information to supply, what questions or comments to submit, whether you wish to receive further information, and by what method of communication such information should be delivered. Please take care to share only such information as is needed or that you believe is appropriate. You are under no obligation to provide us with personally identifiable information, but without it we may not be able to provide you the products or services you request. You may contact us as indicated below if at any time you would like to ask us about our data collection practices and our information security policy.

### How do we protect information collected about you?

APG Services have in place certain commercially reasonable security measures to protect Collected Information, but the storage and communication of Collected Information can never be completely secure. Hence we do not guarantee that information that you transmit or otherwise supply to us, or any communications conducted on or through the Site, is or will be totally secure. If you become aware of any breach of Site security, this Privacy Policy, or the Terms of Use, please notify us immediately.

From time to time, we may change our privacy practices and this Privacy Policy, because of changes in relevant and applicable legal or regulatory requirements, our business practices, or in our attempts to better serve your needs and those of our other customers. Notice of such changes to our privacy practices will be given in the manner described in the Terms of Use and a revised Privacy Policy will be posted on the Site.

If you have entered into a separate agreement with APG Services with respect to the use of the Site or any Collected Information, that agreement will supersede this Privacy Policy to the extent they are in conflict.

### Our commitment to your privacy

In addition to this Privacy Policy, APG Services provides a Notice of Privacy Practices to everyone who becomes a patient of APG Services through this site. This Notice, sometimes referred to as a “HIPAA Notice,” describes how medical information about you may be used and disclosed and how you can get access to this information. In this Notice, we describe the ways that we may use and disclose health information about our patients. This Notice describes your rights as our patient and our obligations regarding the use and disclosure of Personal Health Information (PHI). We encourage you to read this Notice and know your rights. If you would like more information regarding your privacy, please refer to our [Notice of Privacy Practices](https://web.archive.org/notice-of-privacy-practices/ "notice of privacy practices").
