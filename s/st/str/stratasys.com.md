# Privacy Policy - Stratasys Inc.

Privacy Policy

Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn how we handle your information. Awareness and understanding of our Privacy Policy will allow us to provide you with better service. 

Stratasys, Inc. will not sell or share any of the names, addresses, or information in our databases. Stratasys only collects your information for the purposes of sending the product literature and samples you explicitly requested through trade publications, trade shows, and direct contact with our company. As part of this request and fulfillment process, we do forward your information to the Stratasys product representative, distributor or reseller nearest you. 

**Why we collect personal information**

Stratasys collects and uses your information to give you current market and product information, to provide you with convenient access to our products, and to provide you with excellent service. In addition, we use your information to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, special offers, and other information we believe would benefit you.

**How we collect information**

We collect information about you from requests for product information through trade publication advertising and/or press releases, requests for information from the contact form and email links on our website, and requests for information from trade shows and conferences.

When you browse our website, you are able to do so anonymously. Generally, we do not collect personal information when you browse—not even your email address. Your browser, however, does automatically tell us the type of computer and operating system you are using.

In some of our emails to you, we use a click-through URL. When you click one of these URLs, you pass through our web server before arriving at the website that is your destination. We track click-throughs to help us determine your interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.

**How we protect your personal information**

When you order a product from our web site, we give you the option to use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is required. To make purchases, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Netscape Navigator, or Internet Explorer. This protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it is transmitted over the Internet.

**What you can do**

With any electronic correspondence we send, you will always have the ability to opt-out of future mailings. If you feel you have received a traditional mailing by mistake or if you no longer want to receive printed and mailed infomration from us, fax us the cover letter and we will remove you from the database.
