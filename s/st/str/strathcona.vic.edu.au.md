## Privacy Policy

****All policy, protocols and procedures flow from the Strathcona Mission Statement:

_To be_

  * _The premier Melbourne girls school, recognised for Christian values, an enriching caring environment and a future focussed academic and co-curricular program._
  * _The school of choice for families committed to their daughters achieving their full potential, developing life skills and making a contribution to society through leadership and service._



## Rationale

This policy outlines how Strathcona uses and manages personal information provided to, or collected by it. The School is bound by the National Privacy Principles included in the Commonwealth Privacy Act and the Victorian Health Records Act. This Privacy Policy will be regularly reviewed and updated to take into account new laws and technology, changes to the School’s operations and practices, and to ensure the policy is appropriate for the changing School environment.

The School has adopted the [Australian Privacy Principles](http://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-act/australian-privacy-principles "Learn more about the Australian Privacy Principles") and [Privacy Principles in the Victorian privacy laws](http://www.privacy.vic.gov.au/privacy/web2.nsf/pages/privacy-laws "Visit the Privacy Victoria website") as minimum standards in relation to handling personal and health information.

## Collection of Information

The type of information that Strathcona collects and holds includes personal information and possibly sensitive information, about:

  * students and parents and/or guardians before, during and after the course of a student’s enrolment at the school
  * job applicants, staff members, volunteers and contractors
  * other people who come into contact with the School.



## Personal Information

The School will generally collect personal information held about an individual by way of paper and electronic forms filled out by parents or students, face-to-face meetings and interviews, telephone calls and other communications.

In some circumstances, the School may be provided with personal information about an individual from a third party, for example, a report provided by a medical professional or a reference from another School. If information is provided to us by other people, we encourage the involved party to be informed.

## Use of Personal Information

The School will use personal information it collects for the primary purpose of education and the duty of care of its students, and for other related purposes. These will include, but not limited to:

  * keeping parents informed about matters related to their child’s schooling, through correspondence, newsletters, magazines, reports
  * day-to-day administration
  * looking after students’ educational, social and medical well-being
  * seeking donations and marketing for the School
  * to satisfy the School’s legal obligations and allow the School to discharge its duty of care.



## Sending Information Overseas

The School will not send personal information about an individual outside Australia without:

  * obtaining the consent of the individual (in some cases this consent will be implied); or
  * otherwise complying with the National Privacy Principles
  * the School will take all reasonable steps to ensure that the overseas recipient does not breach the Australian Privacy Principles (such as a cloud service provider).



## Job Applicants, Staff Members and Contractors

In relation to personal information of job applicants, staff members and contractors, the School’s primary purpose of collection is to assess and (if successful) to engage the applicant, staff member or contractor. The purposes for which the School uses this information include:

  * administering the individual’s employment or contract
  * for insurance purposes
  * seeking funds and marketing for the School
  * to satisfy the School’s legal obligations, in relation to child protection legislation and registration with the Victorian Institute of Teachers (VIT)
  * contact information for general communication.



## Volunteers

The School also obtains personal information about volunteers who assist the School in its functions or associated activities, to enable the School and volunteers to work together.

## Photographs

The School will, as part of its activities, take photographs of school activities, staff, students and other personnel for various usages such as newsletters, magazines, website, prospectus and other public relations material, for both internal and external promotion of the School.

Parents are asked to sign for consent of this on the Confidential Family and Medical Details Form. If anyone is opposed to having their own or their child’s image used they should advise the School by indicating this on the above mentioned form. If an objection to the use of images is not received by the School, the School will assume consent to the uses outlined in the Enrolment Information and Agreement Form.

## Disclosure of Personal Information

The School may disclose personal information, including sensitive information, held about an individual to:

  * another school, as required
  * Government departments
  * medical practitioners
  * people providing services to the School, including specialist visiting teachers, sports coaches, etc.
  * recipients of School publications, such as newsletters, magazines
  * anyone to whom an authorisation is given to disclose information.



## Sensitive Information

Sensitive information refers to a person’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, sexual preference, religion, trade union or other professional or trade association membership, criminal record and health information.

Unless the involved party agrees otherwise, or it is allowed or required by law, sensitive information will be used and disclosed only for the purpose for which it was provided or a directly related secondary purpose.

## Management and Security of Personal Information

The School has in place steps to protect the personal information the School holds from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure by use of various methods, including locked filing cabinets and secured storage access.

The **National** Privacy Principles require the School to store personal information no longer than necessary. While it is kept, it is to be securely archived.

## Updating Personal Information

The School endeavours to ensure that the personal information it holds is accurate, complete and up to date. A person may seek to update their personal information held at the School by contacting **the PA to the Principal or the Registrar**.

## The Right to Access Personal Information

Under the _Commonwealth Privacy Act_ , an individual has the right to obtain access to any personal information which the School holds about them and to advise the School of any perceived inaccuracy.

To make a request to access any information the School holds, please write to the **Principal**.

## Court Orders

Staff, parents and students should be aware that the School may receive a subpoena which will require the School to provide documents relating to parents or to students.

Such a subpoena may require the School to disclose sensitive information, including formal or informal notes taken by teachers, pastoral care workers or administration staff.

When the School’s website is visited, it makes a record of the visit and logs the following information for statistical purposes:

  * The Internet Protocol (IP) address of the machine connecting to the School website

  * The date and time of the visit to the site
