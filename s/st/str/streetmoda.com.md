Data Collection

If you do nothing during your visit but browse this website or download information, Street  
Moda may gather and store certain information about your visit. Your internet browser software  
transmits most of this information to us automatically; however, this information does not  
identify you personally.

We may collect and store the following information about your visit:

� The numeric IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your  
computer whenever you are surfing the internet) from which you access the Street Moda  
website;  
� The type of browser and operating system used to access the Street Moda website;  
� The date and time you access the Street Moda website and the length of your visit;  
� The pages you visit, including graphics loaded from each page and other documents you

b.

Use of Cookies

� A �cookie� is a small text file that a website can place on your computer�s hard drive in  
order, for example, to collect information about your activities on the site or to make it  
possible for you to use an online �shopping cart� to keep track of items you wish to  
purchase. The cookie transmits this information back to the website�s computer which,  
generally speaking, is the only computer that can read it. Most individuals do not know  
that �cookies� are being placed on their computers when they visit websites. If you want  
to know when this happens, or to prevent it from happening, you can set your browser to  
warn you when a website attempts to place a �cookie� on your computer.  
� Street Moda discourages the use of web cookies on its website. Temporary cookies,  
however, may be used when necessary to complete a transaction. Certain services use  
cookies to enhance the user experience and avoid multiple login/password authentication.

Voluntary Personal Information Submission

If you choose to identify yourself by sending Street Moda an e-mail, registering for an Street  
Moda online account, participating in a contest or other promotion, or by using online forms,  
some personal data may be collected; however, that data will only be used for limited purposes.  
Street Moda may ask you to voluntarily provide personal information when participating in  
certain activities, such as placing an order with Street Moda or participating in surveys, and  
contests or other promotions.

All of these activities are purely voluntary. You will always have the option of whether to  
perform the transaction and provide this information. Please understand, however, that in order  
to open a Street Moda account or perform an online service transaction, you will be required to  
provide some personal information such as your name, address, phone number, email address  
and credit card number, which is necessary to complete a transaction.

If you choose to provide Street Moda with personal information, we may use that personal  
information to respond directly to a message sent by you or to process a transaction requested by  
you. Street Moda does not share personal information you give us with any other company and  
does not collect information for outside commercial marketing. It will not sell or rent your  
personally identifiable information to anyone.
