#### Service Announcements

Sometimes it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. These communications are not promotional in nature. 

### Special Offers

Members may occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, users will be presented with an option to not receive these communications prior to the first such electronic mailing.

MyStrands takes reasonable precautions in accordance with industry standards to protect our users' information. When users submit information via the Web Site, their information is protected both online and off-line. All users' information is subject to restricted access in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. The servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a locked facility.

### Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as email), we provide a way to correct and update users' personally identifiable information. This can usually be done at the "My Profile" page. 

### Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email and by posting a notice on the Web Site for 30 days.
