In addition, through the use of certain technology, we also obtain non-individualized, generic information about you when you visit the Web Site, including your IP address, browser type and language, access time, and referring website. 

Certain technology in emails and newsletters we send to you also determine whether the message in the email or newsletter has been opened and links contained within have been clicked on.

Sensitive information includes a number of types of data relating to: race or ethnic origin; political opinions; religious or other similar beliefs; trade union membership; physical or mental health; sexual life; or criminal record. We suggest that you do not provide sensitive information of this nature. If you choose to provide sensitive information for any reason, PwC accepts your explicit consent to use that information in the ways described in this privacy statement or as described at the point where you choose to disclose this information. 

It is PwC’s policy to limit the specific, individualized information collected to only the minimum information required to complete a visitor’s request. In any instance where non-mandatory, specific, individualized  information is sought, you will be notified of this at the point of collection. 

If you believe the Web Site has collected excessive information, we encourage you to contact us at [privacy@pwc.com](mailto:privacy@pwc.com) to raise any concerns. 

## Use of data

When a visitor provides personally identifiable information to us, we use it for the purposes for which it was provided to us, as stated at the point of collection (or as obvious from the context of collection). Examples of the types of use are given in the ‘Data collection’ section above. We may also use your data to contact you with information about PwC’s business, services and events, and other information that may be of interest to you. You may unsubscribe from our mailing list at any time by contacting us as set out in the ‘Unsubscribe’ section below or through the unsubscribe link in our communications to you.

## Cookies and log files

Cookies may be used on some pages of the Web Site. “Cookies” are small text files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing a more customized website experience. For example, a cookie can be used to store registration information in an area of the website so that a user does not need to re-enter it on subsequent visits to that area. It is PwC’s policy to use cookies to make navigation of our websites easier for visitors and to facilitate efficient registration procedures. The information about your visit to our Web Site is aggregated and used by PwC for statistical tracking purposes. The information is not used for individual identification and PwC in no way relates your personal information to these traffic pattern statistics. Site statistics are compiled by third parties and therefore your IP address will be passed to third parties for statistical reporting only. 

PwC also uses site analytics providers, which may set cookies in your browser. Site activity information collected by these analytics providers may be combined with personal information held by PwC. More information about our use of cookies and third-party tools can be found [here](https://www.strategy-business.com/cookies). 

If you are concerned about cookies, most browsers permit individuals to decline cookies. In most cases, you may refuse or delete one or more cookies and still access the Web Site, but site functionality may be impaired. After you finish browsing the Web Site, you may delete site cookies from your system if you wish. 

In order to properly manage the Web Site, we also anonymously log information on our operational systems and identify categories of visitors by items, such as domains and browser types. These statistics are reported in the aggregate to our webmaster. This is to ensure that the Web Site presents the best web experience for visitors and is an effective information resource. 

## Disclosure

Personal data collected by PwC may be transferred or disclosed to third-party contractors, subcontractors, subsidiaries, and/or other PwC firms for the purposes for which the visitor has submitted the information and for the administration of our systems or site and/or other internal, administrative purposes. Personal data may also be transferred to third-party service providers of identity management, website hosting and management, data analysis, data backup, security, and storage services. As a result, personal data may be transferred outside the country where the visitor is located and may be transferred to countries that do not have laws regulating the use and transfer of such information. By submitting data on the Web Site, you are providing explicit consent to the transfer of such data for the fulfillment of your voluntary requests or otherwise as set out in the ‘Use of data’ section of this statement. 

It is PwC’s policy to disclose information to third parties under the following circumstances:

  * As required by applicable law, statue, rule, regulation or professional standard, or through subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process
  * For regulatory compliance purposes
  * When explicitly requested by a visitor
  * When required to deliver publications or reference materials requested by a visitor
  * Or otherwise as set out in this statement. 



## Third-party links

This Web Site may contain links to other sites that do not operate under PwC’s privacy practices. Please be aware that when you link to other websites, PwC’s privacy practices no longer apply and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other websites. We encourage our visitors to be aware when they leave the Web Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website before disclosing any personally identifiable information. This Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected by this Web Site. 

## Data Retention

The personal data that you submit to us will only be retained for as long as is required for the purposes for which it was collected. Contact information about visitors, such as mailing list and subscription information, is kept until the individual unsubscribes or requests that we delete that information. 

## Unsubscribe

Should you wish to unsubscribe from our mailing list or any registrations, we will provide instructions within the appropriate area of the Web Site or in communications to you; or you may contact our [webmaster](https://www.strategy-business.com/press/contactwm). 

## Access

Visitor updates of information should be handled by going back through the registration process. Inquiries about the accuracy of identifying information previously submitted to PwC through the Web Site, or requests to have outdated information removed, should be directed to our [webmaster](https://www.strategy-business.com/press/contactwm). PwC is committed to providing reasonable and practical access to visitors to allow them the opportunity to identify and correct any inaccuracies. When requested and practical, PwC will delete identifying information from current operational systems. 

When personally identifiable information is retained, PwC assumes responsibility for keeping an accurate record of the information once a visitor has submitted and verified the data. PwC does not assume responsibility for verifying the ongoing accuracy of the content of personally identifiable information. When practically possible, if PwC is informed that any data collected through the Web Site is no longer accurate, PwC will make appropriate corrections based on the updated information provided by the authenticated visitor. 

## Security

PwC has implemented generally acceptable standards of technology and operational security in order to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction. Only authorized PwC personnel are provided access to personally identifiable information and these employees have agreed to maintain the confidentiality of this information. 

## Children
