# Stretty News Privacy Policy

Stretty News is committed to respecting your privacy. This privacy policy applies to this website only – it does not cover other websites to which we may provide links.

**Is it possible to access the website without disclosing personal data?**  
Of course. You can visit Stretty News without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. Once you choose to provide us with any information by which you can be identified, it will only be used in accordance with this privacy policy.

**What information do we collect?**  
We collect the personal data that you volunteer on forms you submit to us (for example in entering competitions), and in emails you send to us. The comment system is run by Facebook – so your account will feature publicly.

We require this information to understand your needs and provide you with a better service. We will also use it to send you the information you have requested.

If you believe that any information we are holding on you is incorrect, please e-mail us at [dale@strettynews.com](mailto:dale@strettynews.com). We will correct any information which was found to be incorrect within 28 days.

**Do we use cookies?**  
Yes. A cookie is a piece of text which asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. Your browser adds that text in a small file. A cookie helps us to analyse web traffic.
