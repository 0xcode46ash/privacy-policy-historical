# Strategy Informer: Privacy Policy

  | 

##  Registration

In order to use parts of this Web site, a user must first complete the registration form.  During registration a user gives contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact the user about services on our site for which he has expressed interest.

The given information is only used to personalize the giver with the site. We do not share the information with any third parties.

### Profile

We store information that we collect through cookies and log files to create a profile of our users.  A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences.  Consequently, collected information is tied to the users personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user’s visit to our Web site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them.  We do not share your profile with other third parties. ** **

### Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user.  Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.  We use  session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates.  A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.

By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.  If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site.  The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site.  For example, [the user will not be able to participate in any of our sweepstakes, contests or monthly drawings that take place.] Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.  See the “Profile” section.

### Third Party Advertising

The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by Amazon.com and some outside shopping sites.

This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Strategy Informer only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.  

### Log Files

Like most standard Web site servers we use log files.  This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. We use a tracking utility called Counter! that uses log files to analyze user movement. See the Profile section below.

** Communications from the Site **

##  Newsletter

If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as email address.  Out of respect for our users privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications.  Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.

##  

##  Service Announcements

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement.  For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email.  Generally, users can deactivate their newsletter account not to receive it.  However, these communications are not promotional in nature.

##  Customer Service

We communicate with users on a very regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email.

** Sharing**

##  Legal Disclaimer

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

## Choice/Opt-out

Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for information.  For example, our order form has an ‘opt-out’ mechanism so users who signed for our service, but don’t want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists. 

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications at [www.strategyinformer.com/community/subscribe.shtml](http://www.strategyinformer.com/community/mailinglist.htm)

## Links

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Strategy Informer, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

##  Security

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information.  When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry \- SSL.  While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just ‘surfing’.   

If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send an email to [magpie@strategyinformer.com](mailto:magpie@strategyinformer.com)

## Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information

If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users’ personally identifiable information. This can usually be done by emailing our Customer Support at [magpie@strategyinformer.com](mailto:magpie@strategyinformer.com) **.**

##  

##  Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

If, however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.  However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner.  In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
