StreamAudio Privacy Policy** This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for the StreamAudio media players used by StreamAudio to stream the audio signal of its customers. Those media players are referred to as the “Players.” “StreamAudio” is a trade name of ChainCast Networks, Inc. 

**This Privacy Statement notifies you of:**

  1. What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identification is collected from you through the Players   

  2. The organization collecting the information   

  3. How the information is used   

  4. With whom the information may be shared   

  5. What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information   

  6. The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control   

  7. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.   

  8. If you feel that we are not abiding by our posted privacy policy, you should contact support by email at support@streamaudio.com. 



**Registration:  
**When using the Players, a user is first asked to complete a registration form. During registration a user is asked to give an email address. This information is optional for the user to provide. It is also optional for the user to provide demographic information (year of birth, gender and zip code) 

**Cookies:**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. We use cookies to record that a user has completed our registration form. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on the Players. For instance, by using a cookie, the Players will not display the registration form once it has been completed by a user. If a user rejects the cookie, he or she may still use the Players. Some of our business partners use cookies on the Players (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. 

**Log Files:**  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Players, track users’ movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Sharing:**  
We may share information we collect with our partners and advertisers. We may partner with other parties to provide specific services. If a user signs up for these services, we may share names or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. Links The Players contain links to web sites and are themselves located on web sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave the Players and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the Players. 

**Surveys & Contests:  
**From time-to-time the Players request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the Players. 

**Security:  
**We maintain internal practices that help to protect the security and confidentiality of the information we collect by limiting employee access to and use of this information. 

**Special Offers:  
**We may send new users a welcoming email. Established users will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below. 

**Choice/Opt-Out:  
**Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having their information used for purposes not directly related to the Players at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our registration form has an ‘opt-out’ mechanism so users who don’t want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists. 

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners or advertisers may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at:support@streamaudio.com. 

**Notification of Changes:  
**If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on the StreamAudio homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
