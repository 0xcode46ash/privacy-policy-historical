REGISTRATION AND USE OF INFORMATION

No user is required to provide information in order to visit Simpson Strong-Tie's Web site. A user must register, however, in order to receive email from us or to participate in some of the other Simpson Strong-Tie services, such as registering for workshops or ordering literature. In addition, a user must register to enter contests and other promotions. During registration for these types of services, a user may be asked to provide certain categories of information, such as name, address, email address and date of birth. The information which you supply to Simpson Strong-Tie enables us to customize our Web site to your interests and enhance your overall experience at our Web site. In addition, it helps us communicate with you about Simpson Strong-Tie news, events and promotions. 

The Simpson Strong-Tie Web site contains links to sites operated by third parties. These sites may collect personally identifiable information about you. This Privacy Policy does not cover third-party data collection practices and Simpson Strong-Tie does not assume any responsibility for third parties. Please check the privacy policy at each site you visit.

PASSIVE COLLECTION OF INFORMATION 

In addition to the information that you actively provide to Simpson Strong-Tie, such as what you provide when you register for the Simpson Strong-Tie services described above, Simpson Strong-Tie collects information about how you interact with our Web site. Simpson Strong-Tie collects passive information for purposes such as testing and improving a user's experience at the Web site and for compiling broad aggregate demographic data and related usage data for Simpson Strong-Tie's internal purposes. The types of passive information include, but are not limited to, your IP address, which type of browser you are using, where you go on our Web site and how long you stay on any part of our Web site. We may also track how you interact with our Web site by assigning a random string of numbers and characters to your session. Passive information does not identify you to Simpson Strong-Tie by name, and Simpson Strong-Tie does not link your IP address to your personally identifiable information. 

We use a “cookie” based data collection paradigm in certain areas of our Web site. Cookies are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing customized services; for example, the use of cookies allows us to reduce the frequency with which you will need to enter your password on password-protected areas of our Web site. Additionally, in some cases, certain functionalities are only feasible through the use of a cookie. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on our Web site and/or you may be required to reenter your password more frequently during a session.

 **COLLECTION OF INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN**

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and other laws have been established to protect the privacy of minors. Simpson Strong-Tie abides by all federal and state laws and guidelines regarding youth privacy. As such, Simpson Strong-Tie will not knowingly collect any personal information from young people under the age of 18, unless Simpson Strong-Tie provides notice that such information is being collected and obtains verifiable parental consent. 

SHARING OF INFORMATION 

Simpson Strong-Tie pledges that it will not sell or rent your information. Simpson Strong-Tie may, however, share broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information with our business partners. This aggregate information does not contain any personal information which can identify any individual user.

While Simpson Strong-Tie strives to protect the personal information of our users, Simpson Strong-Tie will release personal information if required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary.

We may also use third parties that we refer to as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the business, product and service operations that we provide to you, and we may provide some of your personal information directly to these internal service providers. The internal service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced operation, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses. In some instances, the internal service provider may collect information directly from you. In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the internal service provider, and all additional information you provide them and their additional uses will be strictly up to you. If you provide additional information to an internal service provider directly, then their use of your personal information is governed by their applicable privacy policy.

In the event that we, our parent company or certain of our assets or our parent's assets are acquired, user information may be included among the transferred assets.

Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Web site. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private. 

SECURITY

Simpson Strong-Tie has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and/or unauthorized alteration of the information under our control. Simpson Strong-Tie protects personally identifiable information by utilizing both online and offline security methods, including firewalls, passwords and restricted physical access to the places where your information is stored. Our staff is trained to comply with our security procedures, and our security procedures are regularly reviewed and revised, if necessary. 

OTHER INFORMATION COLLECTORS 

Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, whether they are users on our Web site or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to people that we do not employ or manage, and users of this Web site are encouraged to review the privacy policies of other companies that may be accessed through this Web site. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.
