### 3\. Legal basis of the processing

We process and use your data to execute the contract and provide our services, to improve our services and our websites and to adapt them to your needs and to provide updates and upgrades.

Article 6 I lit. a of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides us with a legal basis for processing operations, in which we obtain consent for a particular processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is required to fulfil a contract, the processing is based on Article 6 I lit. b GDPR. The same applies to processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures, for example in cases of enquiries regarding our products or services. If we are subject to a legal obligation which requires the processing of personal data, such as the fulfilment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Article 6 I lit. c GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6 I lit. f GDPR. Processing operations that are not covered by any of the aforementioned legal bases are based on this legal basis if the processing is necessary for the protection of our legitimate interests or those of a third party, unless the interests, fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms of the person concerned (data subject) prevail. Such processing operations are particularly permitted because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. A legitimate interest is usually to be assumed if the data subject is a customer of the controller.

If the processing of personal data is based on Article 6 I lit. f GDPR, our legitimate interest is conducting our business.

We process applicant data in accordance with Article 88 GDPR in conjunction with § 26 of the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG, new version).

### 4\. Categories of recipients

_Registrars and registries:_

For domain registrations, we must forward certain personal data to registrars and registries. This data is stored in the registries' databases and publicly available to a varying extent via Whois enquiries from the registries. Further information about this can be found here <https://www.strato.com/faq/en_us/article/2098/What-is-WHOIS-and-which-data-is-stored-there.html>

_Escrow services:_

All registrars accredited by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) must, in accordance with ICANN's generic domain rules, hold the domain data they manage in a secure environment in trust. This is intended to ensure the reliable management of the namespace. To that end, we use the escrow services of DENIC eG, Kaiserstraße 75-77, 60329 Frankfurt am Main.

 _Processors:_

We pass on various personal data to our processors as the controller within the scope of the processing. We have ensured the security of your data by concluding data processing agreements. Our processors can be divided into the following categories: 

  * Provision of services: These include newsletter delivery, printing and shipping of invoices, customer surveys, payment service providers, data carrier destruction
  * Operation of services, maintenance and upkeep of hardware and software



We only release data to authorities and third parties in accordance with statutory provisions or a legal title. Information may be provided to authorities on the basis of a legal regulation on security or for prosecution purposes. Third parties will only receive information if required by law. This may be the case, for example, in the case of a copyright infringement.

Furthermore, in exercising your right to data transferability under Article 20 (1) GDPR, you have the right to arrange that your personal data is transmitted directly from one controller to another, where this is technically feasible and as long as this does not affect the rights and freedoms of others.

### 8\. Statutory or contractual requirement, for the provision of personal data, necessity for the conclusion of the contract, obligation to provide the personal data, possible consequences of failure to provide data

The provision of personal data may in part be required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or result from contractual provisions (e.g. information about the contracting party). Sometimes it may be necessary that you provide us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us, in order to conclude a contract. For example, you are required to provide us with personal information when we conclude a contract with you. Failure to provide the personal data would mean that the contract could not be concluded.
