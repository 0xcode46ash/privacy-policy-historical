Thank you for visiting StrideRite.com, a StrideRite LLC Web site. Your privacy is important to us. We understand that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act responsibly. This policy explains how we collect information from you and how we use it. Please read on for more details about our privacy practices.

  


### What Information Does Stride Rite® Collect?

StrideRite does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals except when the information is knowingly provided. For example, when you upload a photo or video to our site, you voluntarily enter certain information. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected on this site include: your state of residence and your email address.

We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit our web pages such as the type of browser you are using, the type of operating system you are using and the domain name of your Internet service provider.

  


### How Do We Use The Information?

We may use the information you provide about yourself to respond to your inquiries about our products, offerings, and services, and to offer you other products, programs or services we think you will find valuable.

We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests or when we make changes to our web site or subscriber agreements, or to fulfill a request by you for information about a product or store location.

We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as offer you other products, programs or services.

We may store and disclose personal information as allowed or required by applicable law, including making disclosures that are necessary or advisable to: (a) protect the rights, safety or property of users of our web site, the public, or StrideRite; and (b) conform to legal or regulatory requirements.

  


### Does Stride Rite Use "Cookies"?

Yes. "Cookies" are bits of electronic information that a web site can transfer to a visitor's hard drive. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information.

We use cookies to help make our site better by showing how and when you use the site. Stride Rite does not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is the information shared with any third parties.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that if you would rather not store the information for future use.

  


### Does Stride Rite Disclose The Information It Collects To Outside Parties?

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily provide to us. However, the data collected may be provided to other parties in an aggregate form for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

Our site sometimes offers contests, sweepstakes, or promotions that are sponsored by or co-sponsored with identified third parties. By virtue of their sponsorship, these third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion. Stride Rite has no control over the third-party sponsors' use of this information.

If a visitor at anytime chooses to opt-out from any future mailings or contact from Stride Rite, please let us know by e-mail at customerservice@StrideRite.com and include your name and e-mail address. Another option is to visit the StrideRite Online email signup web page and click "unsubscribe".

If you believe Stride Rite has information from anyone under 13, please contact us at customerservice@StrideRite.com.

Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, Stride Rite does not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third-party for any purpose whatsoever. Information provided by a parent voluntarily about their children under 18 might be used internally.

### Third Party Links

Stride Rite may choose various third party web sites to link to either from our own site or by providing the link by sending you e-mail information. However, even if the third party is a partner or affiliated with Stride Rite, we have no control over these linked sites that have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of Stride Rite. We have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions and are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. These linked sites are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk.
