4.1 **_Voluntarily Provided_**. Other than Customer Data which obtained and processed by Selligent as provided in **Section III** ( ** _Customer Data_** ), we obtain Personal Information about you as a Visitor, a prospective business contact or Customer if you choose to provide it.  For example, if you contact our email mailboxes or you are listed as the contact person for certain Services ordered by a Customer or if you create a profile for a Customer account. In some cases, you may have previously provided your Personal Information to Selligent (if, for example, you are a former Customer).

Such information may include: name; email address; physical location/address; entity affiliation; and information about intended or desired use, interests, and preferences.

By submitting Personal Information to Selligent, you are also agreeing to the use of this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your Personal Information is not used for other purposes, unless we obtain your permission, or unless otherwise required or permitted by applicable law. For example, if you send us an email message requesting information about Selligent, we will use your email address and other information you supply to respond to your request.  If you send us a resume to apply online for a position with Selligent, we will use the information that you provide to match you with available Selligent job opportunities. Where we ask for use your Personal Information for additional purposes, we will ask your permission for this at the point of collection.

Selligent generally collects only the Personal Information necessary to fulfill your request. Where additional, optional information is sought, you will be notified of this at the point of collection.

Other than Customer Data which may contain “sensitive Personal Information which is processed by Selligent as provided in **Section III** ( ** _Customer Data_** ), Selligent only collects "sensitive" Personal Information when the relevant individuals voluntarily provide us with this information or where such information is required or permitted to be collected by law or professional standards.

**4.2 _Automatic Collection of Personal Information_.**

In some instances, Selligent and its service providers use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to automatically collect certain types of information when our Websites are accessed, or when Customer uses the Services, or through emails that Selligent may exchange with a Visitor or Customer.

The collection of this information allows us to customize a Visitor’s or Customer’s online experience; improve the performance, usability and effectiveness of the Services; advertise and market our services; measure the effectiveness of our marketing activities; and generate and analyze statistics about our Customers use our Services.

Please see **Section III ( _Customer Data_** ) regarding our automatically collecting Personal Information as part of the Services we provide on behalf of our Customers.

**(a) _IP Address/log information_** When Visitors or Customers visit any of our Websites, we may collect (automatically log) their IP address (the unique address identifying a computer on the Internet) and standard web log information, such as browser type and the pages accessed on our Websites. The IP address will be automatically recognized by our servers. We may also use this information in aggregate form to maintain and improve our Websites and the Services and to generate and analyze statistics about our Websites and the Services and our Customers’ use of the Services.

**(b) _Cookies_** When our Websites are accessed, “cookies” may be placed by or for us on the visiting computer. When a Customer accesses a Service by logging in using a password and/or user ID, we send a "session cookie" to that computer. This type of cookie helps us recognize visits to multiple pages on the Websites during the same session, so that we don't need to ask for a password on each page. Once a registered Customer has logged out or a browser is closed, this cookie expires and no longer has any effect. We may also use longer-lasting cookies for other purposes such as to display an email address on a sign-in form, to avoid the need to retype the email address on each log in to a Customer account. We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them.  You are free to decline our cookies if the browser permits, but doing so may interfere with use of our Websites.

**(c)** **_Do Not Track_ **Our Services may not recognize browser-based Do Not Track signals. However, as discussed above under “Cookies,” you may be able to modify your browser settings to block all cookies, or to block “third-party” cookies. Cookies that we set on our Services are considered “first-party” cookies. Details on your ability to restrict or change the personal information that we may collect about you are listed below **Section XII (Your Choices, Including Opt-Out Options)** of this Privacy Policy.

**(d) _Usage Analytics_ **Selligent uses several third-party usage analytics tools including Google Analytics. More information about how Google Analytics is used by Selligent can be found here: **<http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html>**.

To provide Visitors with more choice on how their data is collected by Google Analytics, Google has developed the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. The add-on communicates with the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js) to indicate that information about the website visit should not be sent to Google Analytics. The Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on does not prevent information from being sent to the Services or to other web analytics services.

**(e)   _Location-based tools_ **Selligent may collect and use the geographical location of a Visitor’s or Customer’s computer or mobile device, but only with the express consent of the Visitor or Customer.  With respect to the collection of precise information about the location of a Visitor or Customer’ mobile device, once the Visitor or Customer has consented to the collection, the consent may be adjusted by them by managing your location services preferences through the settings of the mobile device they are using.  This location data is collected for the purpose of providing Visitors and Customers with information regarding Services which we believe may be of interest to Visitors or Customers based on your geographic location, and to improve our location-based Services.

**(f) _Web beacons_ **Selligent or its service providers may use web beacons (i.e., mall image file on a web page that can be used to collect certain information from your computer, such as an IP address, the time the content was viewed, a browser type, and the existence of cookies previously set by the same server) to track the effectiveness of third party web sites that provide us with recruiting or marketing services or to gather aggregate visitor statistics and manage cookies. Selligent only uses web beacons in accordance with applicable laws.

If you reject the cookies associated with some web beacons, you can render them web beacons unusable, although the web beacon may still record an anonymous visit from your IP address but cookie information will not be recorded.

In some of our communications with prospects, Visitors or Customers, we may monitor recipient actions such as email open rates through embedded links within the messages. We collect this information to gauge interest in our Services, and to maintain and improve them.

**(g)   _Social media widgets and applications_ **The Services may include functionality to enable sharing via third party social media applications (such as the “Like” button on Facebook® and the widget on Twitter®). These social media applications may collect and use information regarding your use of the Services (see details on ‘Social Sharing’ cookies above). Please be aware that certain of the personal information that you provide via such social media applications may be collected and used by other members of that social media application and such interactions are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide the application. We do not have control over, or responsibility for, those companies or their use of your information.

In addition, Selligent may include blogs, forums, crowd-sourcing and other applications or services on its Websites or in social media, in its Services or otherwise online (collectively “social media features”). The purpose of social media features is to facilitate the sharing of knowledge and content. Any personal information that you provide on any Selligent social media feature may be shared with other users of that social media feature (unless otherwise stated at the point of collection), over whom we may have limited or no control.

**4.3 _If You Become a Customer Through an Agreement_**

When you are a Customer, in addition to the information collected as described in _Section 4.1_ and _4.2_ , we also collect the types of information described in this _Section 4.3_.  As described in **Section III** ( **Customer Data** ), as part of providing the Services, we also may collect Customer Data about your customers, and their clients and/or end users (including information they share about others).

Before permitting a Customer to use a product or service, we may require such Customer to provide information we can use to verify the Customer’s identity, address or location, or to manage risk. Such information may include without limitation, bank or credit card account information for automatic payments, taxpayer ID number, or physical location of server(s). We may also obtain information about a Customer from third parties such as credit bureaus and identity verification services. When a Customer is using a Service, we may collect information about a Customer’s computer or other access device for fraud prevention purposes. Customers will also provide Selligent with identifying information to set up and administer the Services, including authorized user identification information, and business and technical contact information, which will be used to perform the Services.

**4.4 _Employees_.** We receive information, including PII when you apply for a job in the “employment” section of the Website. Any such information gathered through that section will be used solely to evaluate whether your background and experience make you a candidate for a career with us. We may also receive information from an employee’s participation in online learning compliance programs (“LMS”) as part of your employment, including email address and other contact information and scoring. The information from the LMS system is stored in the United States, with consent of our employees.  We have provided our employees with our privacy practices for employee information.

**4.5 _Blog/Message Board, email, etc_.**

To the extent Selligent makes available any forum for public comment, such as a blog, message board or chat space, posters should be aware that any profile information disclosed by them is available to all users of the applicable forum, and is thus neither private nor confidential. Selligent cannot guarantee the security of any information disclosed or communicated online in such fora, and posters disclose any such information entirely at their own risk. Selligent reserves the right at any time, in its sole discretion, to remove any content a poster may post on a blog, message board or chat space and restrict subsequent access to any such forum. Selligent further reserves the right to republish any posting to any such forum elsewhere on the Internet in any format. When Selligent is contacted via email, we answer by sending an email response to the sender. We also store the email we receive for archival purposes and for our own marketing purposes if we feel that it is consistent with the nature of the inquiry. We will not use return email addresses for any other purpose unless you give us permission to do so.
