The following document represents StrongMail Systems' privacy policy governing how we use information collected through our website.

### How we use the information we collect

Some pages on our site may ask you to provide personal information, such as when you register for access to a document or an event. In most cases, you will receive a personalized message from one of our sales representatives with more information about StrongMail's products and services, via phone or email. If you have opted-in to receive email communications from StrongMail Systems during any such transactions, you will receive regular newsletters about StrongMail's products and services until you opt-out using one of the clearly specified methods in every email communication.

### Cookies

StrongMail Systems may make use of "cookie" technology, which enables us to customize our site to better suit your preferences. For example, a "cookie" could store your log-in information so that you do not need to register for every subsequent download that requires a form. In all cases, you can set your browser to choose not to accept cookies, but doing so may require you to re-enter certain information at each visit, or prevent us from customizing the site's features according to your preferences.
