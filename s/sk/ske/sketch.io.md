# Sketch.IO - The Maker of Sketchpad

Your privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate, and disclose personal information. The following outlines our privacy policy.

  1. Before or at the time of collecting personal information, we will identify the purposes for which information is being collected.
  2. We will collect and make use of personal information solely with the objective of fulfilling those purposes specified by us and for other compatible purposes, unless we obtain the consent of the individual concerned or as required by law.
  3. We will only retain personal information as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes.
  4. We will collect personal information by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the individual concerned.
  5. Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used, and, to the extent necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete, and up-to-date.
  6. We will protect personal information by reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.

We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with these principles in order to ensure that the confidentiality of personal information is protected and maintained.

## Sketchpad and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

We’re committed to privacy and that’s why our Privacy Policy already adhered to the the high standard of the new European data protection law known as GDPR, and why we’re ensuring we maintain those rights and extend them to all our users, inside and outside the EU.

We use a number of third parties to store user data in order to provide/improve our services:

  * We use [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) to track page views to improve usability of our marketing website and Sketchpad.
  * We use [Sentry](http://sentry.io/) to track errors that occur within Sketchpad and the API. This also includes certain data that correlates with the error, but does not include sensitive customer information (passwords, tokens etc).
