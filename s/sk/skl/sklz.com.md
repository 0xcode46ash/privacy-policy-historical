Pro Performance will always respect the privacy of our customers. We want to give the best customer service possible. The only information we collect is the information given when an order is placed. At no time will we sell or share that information with any other company. Purchaser data from customers referred by Weplay, including name, city and state, will be re-submitted to Weplay solely for the purpose of unlocking the MAD SKLZ prop. No other information is shared with any other company. The information obtained from registration on-line is used to save you time in the future and /or receive occasional e-mails.

We collect various types of information depending upon how you use our site. 

  * When you order from us, we collect your name, billing address, shipping address, phone number. We also gather information on the person who will receive any gift you send (e.g. that person's name address and phone number) and we will retain a record of your purchases.
  * When you become a sklzstore.com registered user, we collect your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, username and password.

**SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
We use Equifax Certified 128-bit Encryption technology and SSL Secure Sockets to encrypt important information, such as your credit card data, in an effort to prevent unauthorized access during transmission of your orders over the Internet. We incorporate standard industry practices internally and with our service providers suitable to the degree of sensitivity of the information involved to maintain the security of your personal information and to avoid its disclosure except as described in this policy. Your personal information may also be protected by the password you created when you register at one of our websites where this feature is offered. The confidentiality of any password is yours to protect. You may change it anytime by following the instructions at the website where you registered.

Although we use our best efforts to assure that your data remains secure when maintained by us, security during Internet transmissions cannot be assured. We limit access to personal data only to those Pro Performance, Inc., employees or agents with a specific need to access or retrieve this information. We store data on multiple service systems, in controlled, secure environments.
