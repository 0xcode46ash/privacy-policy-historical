* USE OF INFORMATION OBTAINED BY SKILLPAGES

  1. When you register with SkillPages, you create your own User Profile. We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by SkillPages that we think you may find valuable. 
  2. User Profile information is used by SkillPages primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the service and to be presented to all. 
  3. The User Profile information that you submit to SkillPages will be available to all Users of the SkillPages Platform. All User Profile information will be available in search results generated for Users and may be made available to third-party search engines. People who see your name in searches will be able to access your User Profile information without registering with the SkillPages Platform. 
  4. User Profile information is used by SkillPages to improve the functionality of the SkillPages Platform. 
  5. SkillPages may send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service. 
  6. Generally, you may opt out of such emails through your User Account Settings. SkillPages reserves the right to send you notices about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications. 
  7. SkillPages may use information in your User Profile without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as aggregating how many people are in a network like a group of electricians, and also personalising advertisements and promotions so that we can provide you with up to date SkillPages promotions and sponsors of community groupings. We believe this benefits you. We may use information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to newspapers and Internet sources such as blogs, instant messaging services, SkillPages Platform developers and other Users of SkillPages, to supplement your User Profile. Where such information is used, we generally allow you to specify in your User Account Settings that you do not want this to be done or to take other actions that limit the connection of this information to your User Profile (e.g. removing photo tag links). 


* CHILDREN AGED UNDER 14

SkillPages does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 14 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 14, please do not attempt to register for SkillPages or send any personal information about yourself to us, (including your name, address, telephone number or email address). No one under the age of 14 may provide any personal information to SkillPages on the SkillPages Platform. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 14 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. 

* CHILDREN BETWEEN THE AGES OF 14 AND 18

We recommend that children 14 years of age or older ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet. 

* SHARING YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES

  1. SkillPages is about sharing catalogued skill information with Users. We do not provide your contact information to third-party marketers without your permission. We share your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is (1) reasonably necessary to offer the service, (2) legally required or (3) permitted by you. 
  2. We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business. In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities. Where we utilise third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to the SkillPages-specified purposes. This site uses various analytics services to monitor and improve the quality and usability of the SkillPages Platform. 
  3. If you, your contacts or members of your community network use any third-party applications developed using the SkillPages Platform (“Platform Applications”), those Platform Applications may access and share certain information about you with others. You may opt out of any sharing of certain or all information through Platform Applications. In addition, third-party developers who have created and operate Platform Applications (“Platform Developers”), may also have access to your personal information (including your contact information) if you permit Platform Applications to access your data. Before allowing any Platform Developer to make any Platform Application available to you, SkillPages requires the Platform Developer to enter into an agreement which, among other things, requires them to respect your privacy settings and strictly limits their collection, use and storage of your information. However, while we have undertaken contractual and technical steps to restrict possible misuse of such information by such Platform Developers, we cannot and do not guarantee that all Platform Developers will abide by such agreements. Please note that SkillPages does not screen or approve Platform Developers and cannot control how such Platform Developers use any personal information that they may obtain in connection with Platform Applications. In addition, Platform Developers may require you to sign up to their own terms of service, privacy policies or other policies, which may give them additional rights or impose additional obligations on you. 
  4. We may be required to disclose User information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the SkillPages service or using the SkillPages name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies. 
  5. We let you choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers through on-site offers. 
  6. You can share your SkillPages information with outside applications and websites to make your experiences on those applications and websites better and more commercial. 
  7. We are not responsible for any third party applications and websites that you interact with through the SkillPages Platform. 
  8. If you allow an application or website to connect with your SkillPages account, that application or website can access information on SkillPages related to you and your contacts and generate and publish stories about actions you take on that application or website without any additional permission. An application or website that you connect with can generally access the same information that you can see about yourself and your contacts, and an application or website that your contacts connect with can access the same information about you that the contacts can see. 
  9. You can report any suspected misuse of the SkillPages Platform to us, and we will investigate the claim and take appropriate action. 
  10. If the ownership of all or substantially all of the SkillPages business, or individual business units owned by SkillPages Holdings Limited, were to change, your User information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations. In any such transfer of information, your User information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy. 
  11. All sharing of information is done at your own risk. 


* LINKS

SkillPages may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. We encourage our Users to be aware when they leave our site that they should read the privacy documents of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by SkillPages. 

* THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING

Advertisements that appear on SkillPages are sometimes delivered (or “served”) directly to Users by third-party advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third-party advertisers may also download cookies to your computer or use other technologies such as JavaScript and “web beacons” (also known as “1x1 gifs”) to measure the effectiveness of their adverts and to personalise advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognise your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their adverts and to personalise advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. SkillPages does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third-party advertisers. 

This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by SkillPages and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking technologies by any of its advertisers. 

* CHANGING OR REMOVING INFORMATION

Access and control over most personal information on SkillPages is readily available through the User Profile editing tools. SkillPages Users may modify or delete any of their User Profile information at any time by logging into their account. Individuals who wish to deactivate their SkillPages account may do so through your User Account Settings. Removed information may persist in back-up copies for a reasonable period of time but will not be generally available to Users of SkillPages. 

Where you make use of the communication features of the service to share information with other individuals on SkillPages, however, (e.g. sending a personal message to another SkillPages User) you generally cannot remove such communications. 

* ACCESSING AND UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION

  1. When you use SkillPages services, we make good-faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate, or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual Users to identify themselves and the information that they request be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardise the privacy of others or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes) or for which access is not otherwise required. 
  2. You may change or delete your User Profile information at any time by going into your User Profile and editing the information. 
  3. Deactivating or deleting your account. If you deactivate your account Users will not be able to see it but it will not be deleted. Your User Profile information will be saved in the event that you wish to reinstate your User Profile information. When you delete your account however, it is permanently deleted. You will not be able to reinstate your User Profile, you will have to create a new User Profile. 
  4. Even after you deactivate or delete your User Profile you should be aware that copies of the information may remain accessible elsewhere, specifically in relation to the extent that it has been previously shared with others, or if it was copied or stored by other Users. 
  5. Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).

These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. 


* DATA INTEGRITY

SkillPages processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services or as otherwise permitted under this Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information that we process is accurate, complete and current, but we depend on our Users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary. 

* PRIVACY MATTERS

When we receive formal written or emailed complaints it is SkillPages’s policy to contact the complaining User regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between SkillPages and an individual. 

* CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent and we expect that the majority of such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on the SkillPages website.
