* ## EU SAFE HARBOUR PARTICIPATION

We participate in the EU Safe Harbor Privacy Framework.

* ## INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT

  1. We collect information on Users in order to facilitate the operation of the SkillPages Platform. 
  2. The User consents and knowingly chooses to disclose all information that is uploaded to the SkillPages Platform in the form of a SkillPage. When you add to your SkillPage with further information about yourself, you agree that any registration information you give to SkillPages will always be accurate, correct and up to date. 
  3. The SkillPages Search Facility is available to all Users. Users are also invited to enter personal information which provides an enhanced set of search results. 
    1. When you sign up for a SkillPages Account (or 'SkillPage') or other SkillPages services or promotions that require registration, we ask you for personal information such as name and email address. After you have created your SkillPage we provide you with the option to add additional personal information such as phone number. We may combine the information that you submit under your SkillPage with information from other SkillPages, in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services or to suggest to you people you might know, or other people who may have skills of interest to you. For certain information, we give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information within your account settings page. 
    2. SkillPages provides an invitation service when you register with the Platform. If you choose (consent or opt in) to use our invitation service to tell a contact about our site, we will ask you for information needed to send the invitation, such as your contact’s email address or we will ask you to consent to having your contact list(s) imported. We will send your contacts an email in your name inviting him or her to visit the site, and we will send additional reminders. SkillPages stores this information to send invitations and reminders, to register a contact connection if your invitation is accepted, to allow you to see invitations you have sent and to track the success of our referral program. All information that you enter or upload about your contacts will be covered by the same terms of this privacy policy as cover your own information. SkillPages also stores this information (imported contacts information) to avoid duplication of contacts and to check when contacts, not invited by the User, join the SkillPages Platform through registration. SkillPages will also store the User’s access details in order to synch the contacts whenever the User logs in. 
    3. When you visit SkillPages, we use a third party tracking partner to gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. 
    4. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using 'cookies'. For more information about how we use cookies, please refer to the [SkillPages cookie policy](http://www.skillpages.com/cookies). 
    5. Our third party service providers use a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. 
    6. When you use SkillPages, you may set up your SkillPage, form community networks, send messages, perform searches and queries, set up events, add applications, transmit information through various channels and send emails or other communications to SkillPages. We collect the personal information as outlined above so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your community network list. 
    7. SkillPages have the right to reformat and move SkillPages, and SkillPage information. SkillPages reserve the right to remove, edit the look and feel of, move or close any SkillPage for any reason and to suspend or ban any User Account for any reason. 
    8. SkillPages may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed. We use this information to improve the quality of our search technology, customized content and advertising. 
  4. Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on SkillPages is a violation of the SkillPages Terms and Conditions of Use. 
  5. SkillPages only processes personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. In addition to the above, such purposes include: 
    1. Providing our services, primarily making SkillPages available to all; 
    2. Providing more relevant search results by utilizing data provided by the User; 
    3. Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services; 
    4. Ensuring the technical functioning of SkillPages; 
    5. Protecting the rights or property of SkillPages or our Users; and 
    6. Developing new services. 
  6. By using SkillPages, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in such jurisdictions as is necessary. 
  7. We provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys on our site. If you participate, we will link certain personally identifiable information provided when you registered for the site to you. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. We use this information to gauge the level of user satisfaction with the site. We use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys. That company is prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice. 


* ## USE OF INFORMATION OBTAINED BY SKILLPAGES

  1. When you register with SkillPages, you create your own SkillPage. We may use your name and email address to send you notifications. If you no longer wish to receive these email communications, you may unsubscribe by following the instruction contained in each of the emails you receive. 
  2. SkillPage information is used by SkillPages primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the service and to be presented to all. 
  3. The SkillPage information that you submit to SkillPages (including phone numbers) will be available to all Users of the SkillPages Platform (whether the user is or is not a registered member of the SkillPages platform). All SkillPage information will be available in search results generated for Users and may be made available to third-party search engines. If you no longer wish to have your information indexed you have the option of deleting your Account. People that see your name in searches will be able to access your SkillPage information without registering with the SkillPages Platform. If you do not want to be listed in our directory you have the option of deleting your Account. 
  4. SkillPage information is used by SkillPages to improve the functionality of the SkillPages Platform. 
  5. SkillPages may send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service. 
  6. SkillPages reserves the right to send you notices about your Account even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications. 
  7. SkillPages may use information in your SkillPage without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as aggregating how many people are in a network like a group of electricians, and also personalizing advertisements and promotions so that we can provide you with up to date SkillPages promotions and sponsors of community groupings. We believe this benefits you. Where such information is used, we generally allow you to specify in your User Account Settings that you do not want this to be done or to take other actions that limit the connection of this information to your SkillPage (e.g. removing photo tag links). 
  8. We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information. We do obtain the user consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial. If you wish to request the removal of your testimonial, you may contact us at [help@skillpagessupport.com](mailto:help@skillpagessupport.com). 


* ## CHILDREN AGED UNDER 14

SkillPages does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 14 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 14, please do not attempt to register for SkillPages or send any personal information about yourself to us (including your name, address, telephone number or email address). No one under the age of 14 may provide any personal information to SkillPages on the SkillPages Platform.

We may provide information to service providers such as an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf, an author management service to provide you with our blog and a customer support service to gather feedback and assist you with questions to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business. In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities.

We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share Account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the SkillPages service or using the SkillPages name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.

  7. You can report any suspected misuse of the SkillPages Platform to us, and we will investigate the claim and take appropriate action. 
  8. If the ownership of all or substantially all of the SkillPages business, or individual business units owned by SkillPages Holdings Limited, were to change, your User information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations.
