### Requests for Correction of Personal Information

The law permits individuals to submit written requests to us to correct errors or omissions in their personal information where that information is in our custody or control. We do require that all such requests be in writing, with no exceptions, and email is not considered to be in writing. We reserve the right to require sufficient information and detail from the individual in question in order to properly locate the information and provide a response.  In the event that an individual alleges inaccuracies, errors or omissions in the personal information in our custody or control, we will either: 

  * correct the personal information and, if reasonable to do so, send correction notifications to any other organizations to whom we disclosed the incorrect information; or 
  * decide not to correct the personal information but annotate the personal information that a correction was requested but not made. 

Corrections or amendments will not be made to opinions, including expert or professional opinions, as opposed to factual information, which may be corrected if in error.

We reserve the right to amend this Policy from time to time as required and without notice by posting an amended version on our website.
