# Skyscape.com: Privacy Policy

Skyscape Privacy Policy

Skyscape recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of information we may collect from our on-line visitors. To this end, we are committed to using our best efforts to respect the privacy of our on-line visitors.

Information we collect

At various times, Skyscape requests personal information. This can be done while you are visiting the site, or during a purchase via our Web site, phone, or fax. Information we collect is voluntarily provided by a website visitor and may include your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card information (during a purchase), and personal interests. In addition, Skyscape periodically sponsors contests and other promotions that may require additional information in order to participate.

What we do with this information

The requests for information allows Skyscape to provide services you have requested or to enhance your experience while visiting us. The information that we collect during a purchase is necessary for us to process your order, track the status of your order, and provide the best customer service possible.

Skyscape will not sell your private information to any outside company for its use in marketing or solicitation. 

Skyscape may use customer information on an aggregate basis to better understand our users and to improve our services. Aggregate statistics may also be disclosed to potential advertisers and/or business partners. (For example, we might use the aggregate statistic "10% of Skyscape's users are from Massachusetts", but we would not give away that "Mr. John Doe, age 42, is from Boston, MA).

Skyscape may share any information with third parties or regulatory agencies to comply with any laws, or if we are compelled to do so by force of law. In the unlikely event that Skyscape (or substantially all of its assets) is acquired, personally identifiable and aggregate information may be transferred as part of such assets.

Periodically, we will use the information provided to us to notify you of important announcements regarding special offers or important functionality changes to our Web site. Skyscape also provides free email newsletters to those who are interested in receiving them. If you would rather not receive these updates and/or newsletters, you can request to be excluded from these announcements by following the instructions at the bottom of every email.
