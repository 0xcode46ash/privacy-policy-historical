# Skyscape: Privacy Policy

Skyscape recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of information we may collect from our on-line visitors. To this end, we are committed to using our best efforts to respect the privacy of our on-line visitors.

  
At various times, Skyscape requests personal information. This can be done while you are visiting the site, or during a purchase via our Web site, phone, or fax. Information we collect is voluntarily provided by a website visitor and may include your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card information (during a purchase), and personal interests. In addition, Skyscape periodically sponsors contests and other promotions that may require additional information in order to participate.

  
The requests for information allows Skyscape to provide services you have requested or to enhance your experience while visiting us. The information that we collect during a purchase is necessary for us to process your order, track the status of your order, and provide the best customer service possible. 

We may also supplement your data with information from third parties, including the AMA database licensors. For example, if you are a physician, we may compare the name, medical school and graduation information you provide, with the AMA database to help verify the accuracy of our subscriber database.

Skyscape will not sell your private information to any outside company for its use in marketing or solicitation. Occasionally Skyscape will extend offers to our visitors from other businesses. When this is done, Skyscape will not give that business your email address or name. However, we may use contact and demographic information to send you materials from Skyscape or some of our partners, to invite you to provide us with feedback, or to participate in a survey being conducted by Skyscape or one of our partners. If you do not wish to receive these kinds of emails, you may choose to opt out by updating your profile.

We may also use contact and demographic information to send you MedAlertâ„¢ messages. These are medically-relevant messages that are sent to the entire subscriber base or more often, are delivered to select groups of subscribers, based on the specialty. These messages may include safety alerts from the FDA, journal article summaries and medically-relevant educational and marketing communication from 3rd parties, including drug manufacturers. In order to make sure we are targeting the most relevant content to our subscribers, we need to understand who our subscribers are and collect information, such as profession and specialty that will assist us in tailoring their experiences.

Skyscape may use or provide aggregate or non-personally identifiable data about our customers; sales, product usage or traffic patterns, and related website information to better understand our customers and improve our services. This data will not include any personally identifying information such as your name or contact information. (For example, we might use the aggregate statistic "10% of Skyscape's users are from Massachusetts", but we would not give away that "Mr. John Doe, age 42, is from Boston, MA). Tracking data may also be used internally by Skyscape for developing and enhancing products and improving technical usability. 

Skyscape may share any information with third parties or regulatory agencies to comply with any laws, or if we are compelled to do so by force of law. In the unlikely event that Skyscape (or substantially all of its assets) is acquired, personally identifiable and aggregate information may be transferred as part of such assets.

Periodically, we will use the information provided to us to notify you of important announcements regarding special offers or important functionality changes to our Web site. Skyscape also provides free email newsletters to those who are interested in receiving them. If you would rather not receive these updates and/or newsletters, you can request to be excluded from these announcements by following the instructions at the bottom of every email. 

  
Skyscape aims to provide you with information on a variety of medically-relevant topics through our newsletters and other communications channels. For the best customer experience we recommend you confirm and update your profile regularly at the Skyscape website. You have the option of correcting, updating and/or changing contact and demographic information and other information previously provided and stored in our database. If you wish to correct, update or change your information, please visit the home page of our website at [www.skyscape.com](https://web.archive.org/index/home.aspx), click on "My Account", and then sign in using your email address and password. 

You may customize your experience with Skyscape by selecting the type of messages that you want to receive. The initial selection is made during the registration process, but you can opt into or out of any of these services at any time by updating your profile as described above.
