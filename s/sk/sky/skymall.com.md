Our commitment to Privacy   
At SkyMall, we value and respect your privacy. This privacy policy describes what personal information we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, and when we share it with third parties.   
It also describes the choices you can make about how we collect and use your information 

We will ask you to provide us with the personal information we need to complete your transaction, to enable us to provide you with customer service, or so that you can register for special offers, benefit programs, email updates, or other services, contest, sweepstakes, or opportunities. 

We require your name, address, telephone number, and email address to fulfill and confirm your order and to contact you regarding your purchases and shipments. We may also ask for optional interest or demographic information which will help us and our partners gain a better understanding of who we're serving, and therefore, improve our service to you. Your name, address, telephone number, and in some cases, email address, will be shared with the merchant partners who will fulfill your merchandise orders. 

Any information you choose to provide to SkyMall.com will be protected by a password you set and which you alone retain. The information is stored on a secure server which is not accessible to the Internet. 

If you have made a purchase at SkyMall, registered for one of our affiliated services or benefits programs, or signed up for another special offer or opportunity, we may occasionally update you via email of specific opportunities we feel may be of special interest to you, or we may supply your name and address to carefully screened companies who we feel may have products or services which will be of interest to you. 

If you would prefer not to receive notice of such opportunities, simply indicate this during the checkout process: make sure the box next to the statement "SkyMall's partners may send me information about products and services which may be of interest to me" is not checked or contact us at 1-800-SkyMall (1-800-759-6255) and request that your name be removed from our mailing list. If you have asked that we not share your information, we may still need to provide your contact information to third parties to ensure that you do not receive any marketing messages from them. 

SkyMall.com collects statistical information which allows us to track the frequency of visits to our different merchants and departments. We also collect information associated with visits and purchases. The information is collected for statistical purposes only, does not contain any personally identifiable information, and may be shared with third parties only in the aggregate. 

Like most major web sites, SkyMall.com uses "cookies" to enable us to serve you. A cookie is a small data file which is written to your hard drive when you visit, which assigns you a unique ID and allows us to save selections made and information entered during your time at our site, and to recognize you when you return. The cookie does not collect any personally identifiable information. SkyMall.com also uses cookies to determine if you have been referred to SkyMall.com from a particular link, banner, or partner site and to allow third-parties to help us serve targeted product recommendations. These companies may use data about you in order to provide recommendations for products and services that might be of interest to you. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt out of this type of advertising, you can visit networkadvertising.org.   
  
Children's Privacy   
If you are a minor, please only use this site in conjunction with your parents or guardians. If you are under the age of 13, please do not provide any Personally Identifiable Information to us. We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose Personally Identifiable Information about visitors under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.   
Your California Privacy Rights

Please keep in mind that, the foregoing policy and our best efforts notwithstanding, we cannot unconditionally guarantee that your information will never be disclosed to a third party. We may be obligated, in certain circumstances, to disclose information to the federal government in response to a warrant or official request. So, by using SkyMall.com, you do authorize us to disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate. 

Further, the foregoing policy notwithstanding, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access private communications despite every best effort made by SkyMall, using industry-standard measures, to prevent such an occurrence. 

It is our constant intent to provide the safest and most secure shopping experience possible. Since offerings and technologies change, we must reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of the policy at any time. Please check this page for changes.
