# Delta Air Lines SkyMiles: Privacy

We recognize that you may have concerns about your privacy while participating in the Delta Air Lines SkyMiles® Shopping program. Here is what Netcentives, the company providing the SkyMiles Shopping program, is doing to ensure your privacy and security. 

**What information is collected:**   
In order to become an SkyMiles Shopping member, there is certain information that must be submitted. You are asked to supply your name, postal address and SkyMiles® member number. At least one credit card (VISA®, MasterCard® or American Express®) must also be registered in order that we may track your purchases at participating merchants and post the miles you have earned. (Our participating merchants, through their credit card processors, will submit to us the credit card numbers used for purchases, the transaction date, as well as the amount. This information is matched to your SkyMiles member number so that the miles earned can be credited to the appropriate account.) An email address must also be supplied for web registration and is at your option for phone enrollment. 

From time to time you may be asked to respond to surveys and questionnaires in order that we may develop additional information about our members. The information supplied is solely to develop offers and promotions to better serve you and our participating merchants. Responding to the questionnaires and surveys is optional - you are not required to submit this information if you do not care to do so. 

**How the information is used:**   
Your personally identifiable information is never released outside of our program or to agents without your permission. Aggregated data from our members may be shared with our network of merchants but it will not contain personally identifiable information such as your name or address. For example, we may let SkyMiles Shopping merchants know that approximately"X% of our members are male" but no names would be transmitted with that information. 

As a SkyMiles Shopping member, you may request to receive promotional messages from merchants within our network (opting-in for communications). In order to meet your desire to receive promotional offers, it may be necessary to send data files containing personally identifiable information (name, address or email address) to third party agents of Netcentives. These third party agents (data processors, fulfillment companies or mail processors) are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality of any information they may receive and are forbidden from using the information in any other way than to provide the requested services to Netcentives. They may not use, release or resell the data. 

**How we contact you:**   
SkyMiles Shopping occasionally sends its members emails and/or print communications describing new earning or special offer opportunities. We will also provide members with a member guide and quarterly newsletters, both of which give details on the merchant network. You can opt-out of receiving any communications from the program without giving up your membership (see below). 

**Customer Service Emails:**   
SkyMiles Shopping reads every message sent to customer service and tries to respond to every one. This information is used to respond directly to your questions or comments. We may also file your comments to improve the site and program, or review and discard the information. 

**How to correct information:**   
If you feel any of the information we have on file for you is inaccurate or needs to be updated, contact customer service at 1-800-405-4223. 

**How to opt-out:**   
If you wish to be a SkyMiles Shopping member but do not wish to receive any mailings about the program, or, if you wish to opt-out of SkyMiles Shopping membership and close your account, contact 1-800-405-4223 and our customer service representatives will assist you in doing so. 

**Program Security:**   
Netcentives has developed a highly secure system for the transmission of any information with regards to the SkyMiles Shopping program. All the data you provide is protected against loss, misuse or alteration while it is under our control. 

**Other Links:**   
Our Web site has links to other Web sites. Please note that when you click on one of these sites, you are going to another site. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of these Web sites as their privacy policies may differ from ours. 

**Changes to this Policy:**   
We will notify you of any material changes to this policy. SkyMiles Shopping will post a notice as to any material changes on its Web site and, when deemed necessary, will take commercially reasonable measures to ensure that you have been notified. 

**Legal Disclaimer:**   
We may disclose personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on our Web site. 

**Other Questions:**   
If you have any other questions about SkyMiles Shopping or this Privacy Statement, please contact [customerservice@SkyMilesShopping.com](mailto:customerservice@skymilesshopping.com) or call 1-800-405-4223.
