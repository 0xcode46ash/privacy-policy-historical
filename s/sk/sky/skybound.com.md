Privacy

Privacy Policy Updated: November 15, 2012

This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes how Skybound LLC and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively “Skybound” or “we”) protects the privacy rights of our online visitors and how we collect, store, and use the information you provide us online.

The website you are currently visiting is operated by Skybound located at 8931 Ellis Ave., 3rd Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90034. This Privacy Policy currently applies to all of the website(s) operated by Skybound (collectively referred to as “Skybound Websites” or “our Websites”). If we wish to include additional websites under this Privacy Policy, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that they provide a link to this Privacy Policy. Some Websites, due to the nature of the content and services they provide, may have additional information relating to the collection and use of information submitted to them. Please read each Website’s Terms of Use as well and Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted and collected online through the Skybound Websites, and does not apply to information that may be disseminated or collected offline. In addition, this Privacy Policy does not extend to websites maintained by other companies or organizations which may be linked to Skybound’s Website. We cannot guarantee that the privacy policies of such sites satisfy the requirements of Skybound’s Privacy Policy and encourage you to read the privacy policy of any website to which you link before you submit any personal information to that site.

By using our Websites, you consent to Skybound’s Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Websites. We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy. If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting the change on our Websites or in this Privacy Policy and, if necessary, give you additional choices regarding such change. Please check back from time to time to ensure that you are aware of these changes. Your continued use of our Websites will signify your acceptance of these changes.

Skybound may collect information about you, but only if you voluntarily provide it to us. Typically, we may ask you to submit personal and/or demographic information in connection with any one of the following features or services.

• Website registration

• Newsletter subscription

• General support

• Product support

• Contests, sweepstakes, and other promotions

• Polls, surveys, or questionnaires

• Message boards

The types and amount of personal information collected for these activities will vary depending on the activity. The requested personal information may include: your name, home address, telephone number, e-mail address and (for those purchasing products online) credit card information including billing and shipping addresses. For some activities, we may ask you to create a username and password and to provide other non-personal information such as your age or date of birth, gender, game and platform preferences (including information about the games and hardware you own), hobbies and interests, and other information (also known as “demographic information”). If demographic information is collected for an activity that also requires personal information, we may combine the demographic information with your personal information. Combining data allows us to customize the notices we send you and the services we provide you according to your interests and preferences. For more on how we use your information, please read the section on use below.

Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives.
