**What Information We Collect.**

Personal Information: We do not collect personally identifiable information about you, except when you wish to provide it to us. We collect personally identifiable information as a condition of registration at the Site, if you wish to purchase our books, clothing, or other products (“Products”), if you subscribe to our mailing list, if you choose to post to our forums, if you choose to complete our surveys and participate in our contests, etc. If you engage in any of these activities on the Site, you may be asked to provide information such as your name, email address, mailing address, and telephone number, age group, gender and product and/or concerns, and information about the brands and products you use. If you decide to place an order, we will also need to know your shipping and billing address, credit card number and expiration date. To protect your personal information, users of the Site must also register with a user name/email address and password.

Aggregate Demographic Information: Skybound gathers aggregated demographic information through its tracking of IP addresses and other types of traffic data. This information is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. Skybound may share this aggregated demographic information with its partners, advertisers, or affiliates.

Surveys & Contests: On occasion, Skybound requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary. Information requested may include contact information, such as name, email, address, age, and demographic information. If you do not consent to providing any of these types of information, do not participate in the survey or contest. Contact information will be used solely to notify the winners and award prizes.

Mailing Lists: At the time of sign-up, members may opt to receive information on Products, services, special deals, and newsletters. Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by emailing us at info@Skybound.com. Notwithstanding the foregoing, members will always receive Site and service announcement updates, which are distributed to members automatically.

Forums; Blogs; Message Boards: If you register for access to our blogs or message boards, we will use your personal information to enable you to view and post messages on the boards. However, you should understand that community forums, blogs, and message boards are tools that allow you to communicate with members of the online community. As such, whenever you give out personal information in public areas, that information can be collected and used by others. We are not responsible for any information you provide publically or to third parties.

**How We Use Your Information.**

The information we request from you may be used to notify you of Skybound Products and services, sales and promotions, or other matters that may be of interest to you or to contact you in relation to an order you have placed or your use of the Site. It may also be shared with our affiliates, subsidiaries and/or agents, and may be used to provide services and other information that you request from us for promotional purposes. Sharing your information enables these parties to follow-up with you on information you request, to complete your transaction or to provide you with information on Products or services we think you may enjoy. We do not authorize any of these parties to sell, share, or rent this information or use it for any purpose not disclosed in this Privacy Policy, and you may, at any time, discontinue receiving email communications from Skybound, our affiliates, subsidiaries and/or agents by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link contained in every email communication sent by us.

We may also use your information for market research purposes provided you have explicitly and specifically consented to use for this purpose.

We will send personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people when:

We have your consent to do so.

We need to share the information in order to provide the Product or service you have requested.

We need to send the information to third party service providers who work on behalf of Skybound to provide a product or service for you on our behalf and to provide other services, including, but not limited to, payment processing, shipping, order tracking, promotional fulfilment, and customer service. Unless we tell you differently, these third party service providers do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.

We need to respond to valid legal process. This includes a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, and any other instance when we believe we are required to do so by law.

We deem it necessary to disclose personally identifiable information, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, or to protect Skybound’s rights or interests. We may also exchange information, including personally identifiable information, with other companies and organizations for credit fraud protection and risk reduction.

Skybound sells or buys stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that Skybound, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your customer information will be one of the transferred assets. If we purchase a business, the personally identifiable information received with that business would be treated in accordance with our Privacy Policy in effect at that time, so long as it is practicable and permissible to do so. If we sell a business, we will include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your personally identifiable information in the same manner required by our Privacy Policy in effect at that time. The provisions of this paragraph will apply also if we are sold as a part of bankruptcy proceedings.

**Traffic Data.**

We automatically track and collect the following categories of information when you visit our Site: (1) IP addresses; (2) domain servers; (3) types of computers accessing the Site; (4) web beacons; and (5) types of web browsers used to access the Site (collectively “Traffic Data”). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you but is helpful for marketing purposes or for improving your experience on the Site. We also use “cookies” to customize content specific to your interests, to endure that you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, and to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Site.

Cookies and IP Addresses: We may place a “cookie” on your computer’s hard drive so we can recognize you as a return user in order to personalize and improve your experience. A cookie is a piece of data that enables us to track and target your preferences. The cookie will be stored on your computer’s hard drive until you remove it. We may also use temporary or “session” cookies to help you shop. You can have your browser notify you of, or automatically reject, cookies. If you reject our cookies, you may still use the Site, but you may be limited in the use of some of the features. Some of our affiliates may also use cookies on the Site. However, we have no access to, or control over, these cookies and do not accept any responsibility for such use. We may, in addition, use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track traffic patterns, and gather demographic information for aggregate use, as well as in combination with your personally identifiable information for credit fraud protection and risk reduction. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but please note that you may at any point in time change your browser settings to stop receiving new cookies or request to be asked at each time whether you wish a cookie to be installed onto your hard drive. If you decline or delete cookies, some parts of the Site may no longer work properly.

Third party vendors use cookies to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits to this Site and/or other sites on the Internet. Skybound does not control and disclaims liability for the actions of third party vendors. For more information on third-party vendors’ use of cookies for interest-based advertising and how to opt out, visit www.aboutads.info.

Web Beacons: We may use web beacons (or clear GIF’s) on our Site or include them in the email messages we send you. Web beacons (also known as “web bugs”) are small strings of code that provide a method of delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data. We use web beacons for many purposes, including site traffic reporting, unique visitor counts, advertising and email auditing and reporting, and personalization. Information gathered through web beacons may be linked to your personal information.

IP Addresses: Skybound may also keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to troubleshoot technical concerns and to maintain website safety and security. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.

Log Files: Skybound may collect information in the form of logs – files that record website activity and gather statistics about web users’ browsing habits. These entries are generated anonymously, and help us determine (among other things) how many and how often users have visited our Site, which pages you have visited, and other similar data (a.k.a., navigational data). We also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you. Log files are used internally only, and are not associated with any particular user, computer, or browser.

**Security.**

Various security measures such as SSL are implemented by us in accordance with industry standards to protect the security of your personal information as well as sensitive information (such as credit card number) both online and offline. If you have any questions about security at the Site, you can email us at info@Skybound.com.

**Links.**

We may provide links to other websites solely for the convenience and information of our visitors. These websites are not under our control and have their own policies regarding privacy that you may wish to review. Please be aware that we have no responsibility for the privacy practices of such other websites. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by this Site. Skybound makes no guarantees about the accuracy, currency, content or quality of the information provided by such third party websites, and Skybound assumes no responsibility for unintended, objectionable, inaccurate, misleading, or unlawful content that may reside on those websites.

**Updating Personal Information; Termination of Membership.**

If a registered member’s information changes or a registered member wishes to terminate his or her membership, Skybound will correct, update, or remove that user’s personal information from its database, upon receipt of notification from the registered member. Members may update information or terminate membership at the member information page or by emailing us at info@Skybound.com.

**Membership Cancellation by Third Parties.**

Skybound will terminate membership of repeat infringers of its [Terms and Conditions](http://www.skybound.com/tc/ "T&C") or this Privacy Policy. If you believe a member is a repeat infringer, please contact Skybound at info@Skybound.com and provide information and any evidence to substantiate that such member is a repeat infringer. Skybound will, at its sole discretion, determine if such member qualifies for termination.

**Changes To This Privacy Policy.**

As the needs of our customers and Skybound evolves we reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at our discretion.
