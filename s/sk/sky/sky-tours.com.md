# SkyTours Privacy Policy

**SKYTOURS PRIVACY POLICY (Effective Aug 01, 2005)**   
We are committed to protecting your privacy while you are visiting our Site. 

**The Information Collected**  
You may visit our Site or call our Travel Professionals to search for travel deals without providing us with any information. 

Sign-Up Information  
You have the opportunity to receive our special travel offers via e-mail. When you sign up for this service, you will be asked   
to provide us with your e-mail address.   
By submitting your email address from the SkyTours.com website , you agree to give us permission to send you emails regarding   
travel updates, newsletters or information that we want to inform you about. We reserve the right to deny you this service.   
SkyTours may offer mailing lists as part of its Service. You agree that you are legally an adult (according to the laws by   
which you are goverened) before subscribing to any of SkyTours mailing lists. You agree not to post copyrighted or illegal content   
on any of SkyTours's lists. You agree that any and all posts made on any SkyTours list become property of SkyTours. SkyTours does   
not vouch for the accuracy, correctness, legality or any other aspect of any posting made on any SkyTours mailing lists.

To subscribe or unsubscribe to our e-mails, you can visit our web site and change info in the "sign-up" box at any time. Also,   
you may unsubscribe to our e-mails where indicated on our e-mails. 

**What We Won't Do With Personal Information**  
We will not sell or rent your personal information to any third parties. 

**Other, Non-Personal Information Collected**  
Like many other Internet sites, we automatically collect non-personal information regarding our visitors, such as software client   
information (for example, IP addresses, browser versions and operating systems) and aggregate information (for example, number of   
pages accessed) in order to analyze Web traffic and usage trends. Information of this nature does not pertain to your specific   
identity and is not associated with your personal information. 

To enhance your experience on our Site, we and our third-party advertiser(s) commonly employ Internet technologies, such as "cookies,"   
to collect and store non-personal information about our visitors. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are transferred by a   
website and stored by your Web browser on your computer's hard drive. With most browsers, you can set the preferences to show a warning   
each time a cookie request is received. You can also set the browser not to accept cookies at all; however, we won't be able to   
personalize your experience if we cannot recognize you. 

Cookies and Web beacons (also called "pixel tags") may be used by us or our third-party advertiser(s) to determine how you reached our Site,   
to track your usage patterns once you are on our Site, and to target our Internet banner advertisements on our Site and other websites.

**What Is Not Covered By This Privacy Policy**  
Except as covered above, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices or policies of any companies or entities that we do not own or   
control, including links to sites that are not maintained by us, or to people that we do not employ or manage. Because these companies or   
entities may have privacy policies that differ from this Privacy Policy (or no privacy policy at all), please be sure to review their respective   
privacy policies before providing them with any personal information. 

**Questions, Comments or Concerns**  
If you have additional questions or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy, please e-mail us at [helpdesk@SkyTours.org](mailto:helpdesl@skytours.org). 

**Privacy Policy Updates**  
We may, in our sole discretion, revise this Privacy Policy at any time; all such revisions shall be effective when posted.   
If we change the way your personal information will be used, we will post an announcement on our homepage. We encourage you to periodically review   
this Privacy Policy in order to keep apprised of our current privacy practices.

**PRIVACY**  
You have read our Terms Of Use, the terms of which are incorporated herein, and agree to such terms.
