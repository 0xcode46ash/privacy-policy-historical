Your personal information helps us to improve our services to you, to prevent fraud or website abuse and enables our third party suppliers to follow through with logistics on our behalf. 

When you create a blu account or submit any personal information via telephone, correspondence, e-mail or fax, all information that is received is securely stored.

## Do We Share the Information We Receive?

We may disclose your personal information to our third party suppliers such as companies and individuals who help to fulfil orders, send emails out on our behalf, deliver products, perform data analysis, offer guidance to our marketing department, provide customer service, fulfil shipping requests, and process credit card payments.

## How Secure is the Information You Hold About Me?

Our work is to ensure the protection of your information while it's being transmitted and to continue to provide a secure website and database.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
