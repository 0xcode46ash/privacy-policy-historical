Common examples include a customer's or job applicant's name, address, telephone number or date of birth.

### 1.4 This Privacy Policy applies to credit information and credit eligibility information

This Privacy Policy also applies to credit information and credit eligibility information, which are specific forms of personal information. General explanations of what is meant by terms including "credit information" and "credit eligibility information" are provided in section 12. Tabcorp does not have a separate policy about the management of credit information and credit eligibility information.

### 1.5 Overview of this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains how we manage your personal information, including:

(a) the kinds of personal information we collect and hold;

(b) how we collect personal information;

### 1.7 Employee records exception

### 9 DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION OVERSEAS

We may disclose your personal information to recipients located outside Australia that provide services to us (for example, we may disclose your personal information to third parties in the United States of America, United Kingdom, Japan, Ireland and India) who provide customer relationship management services, identification and fraud detection services, cloud and data storage services, IT support services and other third party services to us.

However, we only disclose personal information to an overseas recipient if:

(a) we've taken reasonable steps to ensure that recipient does not breach the APPs (other than APP 1);

(b) we reasonably believe that:

· a law or scheme in the country of the recipient includes requirements that are substantially similar to the requirements of the APPs; and

· you can take action to enforce that law or scheme;

(c) we have informed you of the disclosure and we have your express consent; or

(d) the APPs otherwise allow it.

We do not currently disclose credit information or credit eligibility information (other than identification information) to overseas recipients.

### 10 SENSITIVE INFORMATION

We won't collect sensitive information, such as your:

(a) racial or ethnic origins;

(b) political opinions;

(c) religious or philosophical beliefs;

(d) sexual orientation or practices;

(e) criminal record; or

(f) health information;

unless:

  * you consent;
  * it is required or authorised by law;
  * it is needed in relation to you working with (or applying to work with) Tabcorp, e.g. health information relating to a disability that needs to be accommodated in the workplace;
  * it is needed to manage your self-exclusion or voluntary pre-commitment limit, or to remove you from a self-exclusion program (which generally requires a copy of a report from a registered gambling counsellor or voluntary pre-commitment election);
  * it is needed to provide certain training programs or services effectively to you; or
  * it is needed to enact special features on your Tabcorp account(s) (e.g. Minimum Bet Exemptions).



We note that the AML/CTF Act may require us to collect sensitive information (for example, to verify your identity), and we may collect this from third parties. The information will be stored securely in an AML/CTF Risk Register and you will not have access to it. You will not be informed that we have collected the sensitive information.

If we consider that you pose a high risk to our business, we may disclose sensitive information about you to government authorities and may use the sensitive information as grounds to stop providing our services to you. We may freeze your account without warning and without telling you we are relying on sensitive information to do so.

### 11 HOW LONG CAN TABCORP KEEP MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?

If Tabcorp:

  * no longer needs to use or disclose your personal information for any purpose that is authorised under the APPs; and
  * is not legally required to retain that information,



then it will take reasonable steps to destroy the personal information or ensure it is de-identified.
