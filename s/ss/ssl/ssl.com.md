Information retrieval is fully disclosed to all authorized parties. 
  3. Our customers choose how their self-disclosed data will be used. We allow SSL business customers to decide how they want the information they disclose to be used. Opting out of information disclosure is available at any time. 
  4. We ensure information quality. We employ advanced technologies, well-defined practices, and a highly trained technical staff to ensure that self-disclosed data is processed properly, accurately and completely. We provide the mechanism for self-disclosed data to be corrected if errors or changes occur.

We strongly encourage companies we select as our business partners to have privacy policies based upon accepted industry standards in the handling of self-disclosed data.

During the business partner selection process, SSL scrutinizes the accuracy and quality of the data candidates, as well as their information handling practices.
