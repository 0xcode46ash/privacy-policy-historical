#### **What are Your Rights Under the Privacy Act of 1974?**

The Privacy Act of 1974 protects the personal information the federal government keeps on you in "systems of records (SOR)." SOR is information an agency controls that can be retrieved by name or some other personal identifier. The Privacy Act regulates how the government can disclose, share, provide access to, and maintain the personal information that it collects. Not all information collected online is covered by the Privacy Act.

The Act's major provisions require agencies to:

  * Publish a Privacy Act Notice in the Federal Register explaining the existence, character, and uses of a new or revised SOR;
  * Keep information about you accurate, relevant, timely, and complete to assure fairness in dealing with you; and
  * Allow you to, upon request, access and review your information held in a SOR.



An overview of the Privacy Act can be viewed at the following web site: <http://www.justice.gov/opcl/overview-privacy-act-1974-2012-edition>

Unauthorized attempts to upload or change information on this server are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act or other law.
