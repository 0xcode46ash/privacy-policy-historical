# Social Security Online Privacy Policy

| 

The privacy of our customers has always been of utmost importance to the Social Security Administration. In fact our first regulation, published in 1937, was written and published to ensure your privacy. Our concern for your privacy is no different in the electronic age. 

Our Internet privacy policy is: 

  * You do not have to give us personal information to visit our site. 
  * We collect personally identifiable information (name, email address, Social Security number, or other unique identifier) only if specifically and knowingly provided by you. 
  * Personally identifying information you provide will be used only in connection with _Social Security Online_ or for such other purposes as are described at the point of collection. 
  * We sometimes perform statistical analyses of user behavior in order to measure customer interest in the various areas of our site. We will disclose this information to third parties only in aggregate form. 
  * We do not give, sell or transfer any personal information to a third party. 
  * We do not enable "cookies." (A "cookie" is a file placed on your hard drive by a Web site that allows it to monitor your use of the site, usually without your knowledge.)
