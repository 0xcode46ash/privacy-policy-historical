# SEVENROOMS â€¢ Privacy Policy

_Last updated May 2014_

SEVENROOMS INC. ("SevenRooms"), along with its subsidiaries or affiliated companies, is committed to safeguarding your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes SevenRooms' policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of the information collected through the SevenRooms website, www.sevenrooms.com, mobile applications, and other affiliated websites owned and operated by SevenRooms (the Site, and any products and services provided by SevenRooms, collectively referred to as the "Service").

### 1\. About the SevenRooms Network

Each of the providers listed on the Service has adopted SevenRooms' proprietary reservation and inventory management system ("the SevenRooms System"). The Service interacts with providers' SevenRooms System to find available reservations, to secure, change or cancel online reservations, and to confirm that reservations were honored. While an individual providers' inventory is accessible to the Service to perform these functions, other client information that may be stored by that provider (for example, credit card numbers) is not accessible to the Service. Similarly, the Service passes pertinent information to the SevenRooms System to individual providers as required to secure or cancel online reservations, for example. In some instances a provider may operate its own website and collect a myriad of client/user information directly as part of the online reservation process. In those cases, only the information passed directly to the SevenRooms website to complete the transaction is stored by the Service (e.g. client name, phone and email address).

An online reservation may also be made through a provider's website or via the Service. Similarly, your personal information is passed through from these sites to the SevenRooms System.

This document describes how the Service's user information is collected, stored, used and, in specific instances, shared with providers via their SevenRooms System.

### 2\. What information is accessible to providers:

When you make a reservation using the Service, your name is provided to that provider, just as would occur if you were making a reservation over the phone. Your email address is not provided to that provider unless you specifically indicate that you are interested in receiving emails from that provider. You also have the option of providing special preferences or comments regarding your reservation, which the Service will pass on to that provider.

SevenRooms will only share the information specified above with the provider at which you have made reservations using the Service. Providers cannot use their SevenRooms System to access information pertaining to clients or client histories from other providers, with the exception that providers under the same corporate ownership may elect to share client information between provider properties.

### 3\. Email from SevenRooms:

SevenRooms sends automated service messages pertaining to upcoming or recent provider reservations, such as confirmations, reminders, and/or invitations to provide client feedback. While you cannot unsubscribe from all service messages, you may select not to receive future client feedback invitation emails by following the "unsubscribe" instructions provided.

Where you have consented to receive marketing communications from SevenRooms, you may from time to time receive communications relating to special offers and/or SevenRooms' recommendations. You may unsubscribe from the SevenRooms email list at any time by following the directions provided in the email communications, by replying to the marketing communications with "Unsubscribe" in the subject line.

### 4\. Purposes of use of your personal information:

SevenRooms may use your personal information for the following purposes:

1\. to secure your reservation at the SevenRooms provider you've selected, by providing your name and contact phone number to that provider,

2\. to provide you with information about the Service,

3\. to provide services which Registered Users are entitled to under applicable terms and conditions,

4\. to produce aggregate statistical data for the improvement of services offered by the Service,

5\. to provide you with provider recommendations based on your reservation history,

6\. for any other purposes related to those above.

### 5\. Viewing your profile and changing your personal information:

Once a Registered User logs on to the SevenRooms website, that user can view his or her personal information stored by SevenRooms by clicking on the "Account" link at the top of the page. In addition to being able to view your recent SevenRooms reservation history, every user may also view and change the following personal information: name, email address, password, phone number, and address (if it has been provided by the user). A user may also be eligible to provide and share provider notes and feedback for some past reservations that have been honored. The user at any time may contact SevenRooms to request that all personal information be deactivated.

### 6\. Cookies, web beacons and logging:

Log-in areas on the SevenRooms website require that your browser accept cookies. A cookie is a small amount of information that is sent from a web server to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. SevenRooms uses cookies to verify that you are properly signed in, to display information for your primary location, and to highlight your pending reservations, for example. SevenRooms may also use cookies from time to time to measure your response to new aspects of the website and/or emails in an effort to continually improve customer service and website usability. Please be aware that a cookie cannot spread computer viruses, retrieve any other data from your hard drive, or capture your email address.

You can erase or block cookies from your computer if you wish to do so (your internet browser help screen or manual will thoroughly explain this process), but certain parts of the Service, as well as parts of the website, may not work correctly or will not work at all if your browser is set not to accept cookies.

Web pages may contain electronic images (called a "single-pixel GIF" or "web beacon") that are used to count users who have visited that page, or to access certain cookies.

### 7\. How SevenRooms uses your personal information:

SevenRooms will never sell, rent, loan or otherwise distribute any of your personal information (including but not limited to your name, email address, phone number or any other identifiable information about you) to any third party without your prior expressed written consent, although SevenRooms will pass certain information on to providers at which you make reservations as described above.

SevenRooms does use aggregate data (based partly on IP addresses of website visitors) collected through its website to analyze website usability, system performance and usage trends. While this data, in its aggregate form only, may be shared with third parties with whom SevenRooms works to analyze it, the data will only be shared under the strictest terms of confidentiality and will never contain any personally identifiable information pertaining to any user of the SevenRooms Website.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this privacy policy, SevenRooms may be required to disclose user and personal information in response to inquiries by formal law enforcement, or in cases permitted by the United State's CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (CAN-SPAM), the European Union's Safe Harbor Provisions ("Safe Harbor"), Japan's Personal Information Protection Act ("PIPA"), or other related privacy laws and regulations.

### 8\. How providers may use your personal information:

Providers in the SevenRooms network primarily use client information provided through the SevenRooms Website to secure the desired reservations. Additionally, as noted above, if the user has given permission to a provider to send email to that user's address, the provider may then contact the client with special announcements or offers. If permission is not given, the user's email address will not be passed on to the provider.

SevenRooms providers want to provide you with the best possible service so that you will visit them again. A provider may use its SevenRooms System to take note of your special requests, allergies, special occasions or other pertinent information that will help the provider serve you better during your next visit. If a provider chooses to note your preferences, that information may be typed into its SevenRooms System manually just as a provider might write a note on an index card. This data belongs to the provider, since it is a product of that provider's relationship with you. SevenRooms does not access or use this information, and it is not shared with any other SevenRooms provider or third party, other than, perhaps, a provider under the same ownership. SevenRooms does create backup copies of all information stored on the SevenRooms System for that provider, to assist in the restoration process in the event of data loss.

The providers within SevenRooms' network are separate businesses from SevenRooms. While SevenRooms encourages them to comply with data protection requirements, SevenRooms will not be responsible if these providers fail to comply with respect to your information. Any complaints or inquiries regarding use of your information by a SevenRooms provider, or marketing communications from an SevenRooms provider, should be addressed directly to the provider in question.

Providers within the SevenRooms network may also have their own website. SevenRooms is not responsible for how these providers may collect your personal information through their own website. Please contact the appropriate provider regarding its website's privacy policy (if applicable) and how it will access or use your personal information.

### 9\. How SevenRooms protects your registration information:

SevenRooms uses a state-of-the-art multi-layer encryption algorithm and makes its best efforts to ensure that all of your user information is secure. In addition, SevenRooms stores all of your personal information on a secure server. SevenRooms employs a staff that regularly maintains the security of all personal information stored, and that continually monitors and implements changes and improvements that become available in the electronic data security industry.

### 10\. Changes to SevenRooms' privacy policy:

Any changes to SevenRooms' privacy policy will always be posted to this section of the website, along with the effective date of the new policy. All users should check this privacy policy page periodically to stay abreast of any such changes. SevenRooms will never make changes to its privacy policy that violate any applicable privacy laws, including CAN-SPAM, Safe Harbor, PIPA, or other commercial privacy standards. For any material changes to the privacy policy (in situations where SevenRooms changes the manner in which we handle your personal information), we will notify you via email or by placing a prominent notice on the homepage of our website.

### 11\. Disclosure, correction, suspension of use of personal information:

If you wish to have SevenRooms disclose to you the personal information held by SevenRooms and the means through which SevenRooms obtained such information, or if you desire the information's correction, suspension of use, or to be informed of the purpose of use by SevenRooms, please contact SevenRooms. (Contact information is provided in the "Contacting SevenRooms" section below.) Upon receiving the request, SevenRooms shall meet such request pursuant to the provisions of each applicable privacy regulation after it confirms that such request has been made by you personally.
