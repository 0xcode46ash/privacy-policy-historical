#### Your Information is Safe With Us

At Sevenly you can rest assured that your personal information will never be rented, sold, or otherwise shared with any third party. Of course, this excludes the sharing of your shipping address with one of our shipping providers, UPS, FedEx, or USPS, in order to ship you your shirt. This also excludes the transmitting of your credit card information (fully encrypted) to our credit card processor, Authorize.net, in order to process your payment. These two exceptions are completely normal and necessary for any transaction to take place on any website where a physical product is being sold. What we are trying to say is, your information is safe with us.
