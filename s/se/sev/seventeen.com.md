# seventeen.com | about

Welcome to **seventeen.com** , the online home of **seventeen** magazine. We're psyched that you're here! This site is where you can get the latest info on entertainment, fashion, and life, and it's where you can express yourself through polls and quizzes. (Also you can win stuff!) We'd like you to read and understand our privacy policy. 

**Seventeen.com** is owned by PRIMEDIA. **Seventeen.com** is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We sometimes collect personal information from our users. This page explains what information we collect, why we collect it, what we do with it and what you can do about it. We also ask girls to always check with their parents before giving out any personal information on our website. 

**Collection of personal information**  
**Seventeen.com** maintains the confidentiality, security and integrity of personal information that we obtain from our users. We do not disclose personal information to any outside party. When registering for **seventeen.com** or any of its related services, we ask you to provide certain personal information. This information is for internal use only and will not be distributed or sold to any parties outside **seventeen.com**. 

We strive to create sweepstakes, contests and content which require a very minimal amount of information from our users. Our online surveys, sweepstakes, and contests sometimes ask users for contact information (like their e-mail addresses) or information about their hobbies or interests. This information is also only for internal purposes and will not be shared with any party outside **seventeen.com**. 

**Newsletters and Registration**  
To subscribe to the **seventeen.com** newsletter, you must be over the age of thirteen, and we ask for your e-mail and your zip code. When you register with **seventeen.com** (which gives you access to contests and sweepstakes), we ask for a bit more: your first name, birthdate, zip or postal code, and what country you live in. Again, this information is for internal use only and will not be distributed or sold to any parties outside **seventeen.com**. Newsletter subscribers generally get two emails per month. We might also send out e-mails to users that have opted in for an online service to announce special offers, services and announcements from our site and/or our advertisers. You can opt out of the newsletter at any time by clicking [here](https://web.archive.org/newsletter/html/unsubscribe.epl?SessionCookie=86254452-1-0-682).

When guests request pages from **seventeen.com** , our servers log the users' IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We will know your IP address, but not who you are.

The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our users is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of our users' personal information from their computers to our servers by utilizing encryption software.
