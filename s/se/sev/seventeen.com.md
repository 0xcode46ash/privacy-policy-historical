# Seventeen Online

Hey, welcome to Seventeen Onlineâ€“one of the few places in the world where you can speak your mind freely. . .and actually be heard. We're so psyched that you're here! We knew you were coming so we've cooked up a bunch of ways for you to express yourself, meet other teenagers from across the country and find out what they think about everything from the latest gear to the hottest celebs and the coolest music and movies. Our little community is made up of chat rooms, message boards, instant messenger, buddy lists, email, newsletters, polls, surveys and quizzes-all designed to make you want to stay awhile. 

Hanging in cyberspace with Seventeen is a blast but, the most important thing to us is your privacy. That's why we promise to protect the privacy of each visitor, and each user who registers with Seventeen Online. When you register with us, you tell us some pretty personal stuff and we want you to fully understand why we ask for that info and what we do with it. So, we've come up with this privacy statement which will fill you in on what kind of information we gather, how we use it and how you can correct or change it. 

Questions regarding the Seventeen Online Privacy should be directed to ask17@seventeen.com email address for clarification. To return to Seventeen Online please use the back button. 

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Getting the info**  
Seventeen Online has a handful of ways to gather personal information on the visitors to our site, such as your optional, voluntary participation in message boards, chats, surveys, instant messenger, buddy list, email, as well as contests and sweepstakes. All subscribers are asked to create a fictitious nickname, and provide their first name, date of birth, e-mail address, gender, zip code, state and country. 

**What's Elvis got to do with it?** Basically Seventeen Online uses the information we gather about you to custom fit our site according to your likes and dislikes, as well as those of our advertisers. Say we write a quiz about Elvis, you know, the King of Rock 'n Roll and we see that thousands of you took and enjoyed the quiz. Well, that means that we're sure to run a "Do You Love Me Tender?" quiz in honor of Elvis the next chance we get. Why? Because you told us you were into Elvis. We might also use this same Elvis info to help the folks in marketing develop a line of fat-free Elvis cookies. And then perhaps one of our advertisers might call Seventeen Online and ask how many people "clicked" on the ad they ran next to that wacky Elvis quiz. See? We get all that useful information from one click of your mouse. 

We might also send out emails to users that have opted in for an online service to announce special offers, services and announcements from our site and/or our advertisers. 

**Sharing secrets**   
We're the best secret keepers ever! Seventeen Online does not disclose personal information on any individual user to any third party, including our advertisers and other partners. 

**You want out?**  
Seventeen Online gives users options all the time. Such choices include: Opting not to receive electronic newsletters when registering for a service. Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas such as chat and message boards, which completely alleviate the need for any information from our users. 

**Weirdos, Crazies and Other Privacy Issues**  
While we do a really good job of keeping ourselves in check, Seventeen Online is not responsible for the content or privacy policy of the Web sites we may link to. You need to keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily give personal information online ("I'm 5' 3" and have dark hair like Katie Holmes and I love oatmeal"), by using message boards, instant messengers, through email or in chat areas-it can be collected and used by other people. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from others in return. All we're saying is, there are weirdos out there who make it a hobby to collect information about unsuspecting surfers, so remember that whatever personal information you disclose to anyone online you do at your own risk! Also, you should twice about sharing your password or letting someone borrow your account info. 

**AND** , if you're chatting or chillin' with someone and they start weirding you out or making you feel uncomfortable, simply turn off your browser or computer, if you must, and e-mail us at ask17@seventeen.com to tell us what happened. Make sure you get the user name(s) of the person(s) involved.
