**Your Privacy is Our Priority**  
Sentry Group is committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you only to process orders, conduct contests, and improve our business. We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. Please read on for more details about our privacy policy.

**Order Information**  
|  When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. Your order is always placed over a secure server connection. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. When you purchase products from [SentrySafe.com](http://www.sentrysafe.com/store) we automatically place you on our list to receive e-mail regarding updates about special offers, important safety issues, new products, and new services. If you do not wish to receive e-mail updates please send email notification to [comments@sentrysafemail.com](mailto:comments@sentrysafemail.com), or use our handy [email form](https://web.archive.org/web/20000118122556id_/http%3A//www.sentrysafe.com/contact.cfm).  
**Contest Information**  
  
|  When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address, and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners. Any information you give us is held with the utmost care and security, and will not be used in ways to which you have not consented. In the event Sentry Group plans to publicly post any winner information on a site, you are provided prior notification of such posting and given the option of preventing the posting. We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about special offers, important safety issues, new products, and new services. If you would rather not receive e-mail updates please send email notification to [comments@sentrysafemail.com](mailto:comments@sentrysafemail.com), or use our handy [email form](https://web.archive.org/web/20000118122556id_/http%3A//www.sentrysafe.com/contact.cfm).  
**Secure Your Combination Information**  
  
|  To store your safe combination on our site we ask for a username and password. Both are created by and known only by you. This information is sent over a secure server. We strongly suggest you do not share your username and password with anyone. Stored combinations are so secure even we cannot access this information. Only you, with your password, have access to your Sentry combination.
