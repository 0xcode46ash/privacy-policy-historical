# Sentry | Privacy Policy

At Sentry, we provide real-time error tracking for your web apps, mobile apps and games, which gives developers the insight needed to reproduce and fix crashes. 

Sentry is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy sets out how we collect and process personal information about you when you visit our website sentry.io, when you use our products and services (our “Services”), or when you otherwise do business or make contact with us. 

Please read this policy carefully to understand how we handle and treat your personal information. 

##  What information do we collect? 

We may collect and process the following personal information from you: 

  * **Information you provide to us:** We collect personal information when you voluntarily provide us with such information in the course of using our website or Services. For example, when you register to use our Services, we will collect your name, email address, password, organization information, and billing details. We also collect personal information from you when you subscribe to our newsletter, or respond to a survey. If you make an enquiry through our website, or contact us in any other way, we will keep a copy of your communications with us. 

  * **Information we collect when you do business with us:** We may process your personal information when you do business with us – for example, as a customer or prospective customer, or as a vendor, supplier, consultant, or other third party. For example, we may hold your business contact information and financial account information (if any) and other communications you have with us for the purposes of maintaining our business relations with you. 

  * **Information we automatically collect:** We may also collect certain technical information by automatic means when you visit our website, such as IP address, browser type and operating system, referring URLs, your use of our website, and other clickstream data. We collect this information automatically through the use of various technologies, such as cookies. 

  * **Personal information where we act as a data processor:** We also process personal information on behalf of our customers in the context of supporting our products and services. Where a customer subscribes to our Services for their website, game, or app, they will be the ones who control what event data is collected and stored on our systems. For example, they may ask us to log basic user data (e.g., email address or username), device identifiers, IP addresses, event type, and related source code. In such cases, we are data processors acting in accordance with the instructions of our customers. You will need to refer to the privacy policies of our customers to find out more about how such information is handled by them. 




##  What do we use your information for?

##  How do we protect your information? 

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server.

After a transaction, your private information (e.g., credit cards, social security numbers, financials) will not be stored on our servers.
