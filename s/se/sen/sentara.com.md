Sentara Healthcare is dedicated to protecting the privacy of website users. As a user of our website, you will have access to comprehensive information that will help you to understand certain illnesses, find accurate, in-depth details about local services and providers, and take charge of your personal health.

Sentara wants you to feel as comfortable as possible when visiting our website and using the services it offers. This Privacy Statement tells you what information we collect, how we protect it and what choices you have about how that information is used. Your privacy refers to any information that is collected about you while interacting with Sentara.com.

Sentara may revise these terms and conditions at any time. We will clearly display changes if and when they occur, so that you will always know what information is being collected, how it is being used, and under what circumstances it is being disclosed. Please review this document periodically to be aware of any changes posted, because your continued use of the site will indicate your approval of all changes.

We urge you to read the following Privacy Statement so that you will understand both our commitment to you and your privacy, and how you can participate in that commitment.

**Collection of Information**  
By using this web site, you consent to the collection and use of your information as discussed in this section. 

Generally, personal information is not requested or collected. However, some features offered on Sentara.com require you to register first and provide basic, personal information.

The first time you register, you will be asked to choose a user name and password and provide basic information. Record your password and protect it for future use. If you forget your password, you can provide the email address you used to register and Sentara will email it to you. You have access to your information collected during the registration process, and may choose to update or change your information at anytime with the I.D. and password that you created.

Sentara also collects information that you volunteer through electronic forms such as "[Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/web/20020603172225id_/http%3A//www.sentara.com/contactus/Default.cfm)" and "[Care Options](https://web.archive.org/web/20020603172225id_/http%3A//www.sentara.com/forms/senior_care_options.asp)". For some "transactions" on Sentara.com, certain information is required to process your request. When information is requested from you, Sentara attempts to clearly indicate which information is required and which information is optional. Information collected to process specific transactions is only used for the specific service that you have chosen. However, throughout Sentara's website you are offered opportunities to receive related or general information in the future from Sentara. In cases like these, Sentara will ask for your "permission" to contact you (see next section for more).

Overall, your information is used to maintain accuracy in Sentara's customer files, improve the content of Sentara.com, and enhance Sentara products and services.

**How Sentara Uses Your Information**  
Sentara does not sell, trade, rent or share your personal information to organizations outside Sentara Healthcare and its affiliate companies unless required to do so by legal, judicial or governmental proceedings.

Sentara reserves the right to store and use any information you voluntarily provide for marketing and communications specific to Sentara without additional notice. However, Sentara will make every effort to get your permission ("opt-in") for Sentara to contact you in the future. You will also have the option of respectfully requesting that Sentara not contact you ("opt-out").

Lastly, the information collected about the domain name of the server from which you are visiting is collected in aggregate and used to determine the number of visitors to our site, sources of traffic, and other key indicators of website usage to create a better experience for visitors to Sentara.com. This information does not identify you personally.

**Sponsoring Organizations**  
Sentara works with various organizations to improve and enhance its website. Where Sentara has entered into a relationship with such an organization, Sentara requires the respective organization to fully disclose their business practices including a privacy statement. Sentara encourages you to read the disclosure statements of any such organization so that you are aware of any differences from its own disclosure statements.

****

**Cookies**  
In some instances, Sentara stores a cookie -- a small computer file -- on your computer to make it easier for you to use various Web services on our website. Sometimes, a cookie will be required in order to establish and maintain a secure session so that you can request data and conduct business transactions without having to re-enter information. "Cookies" vary in the amount of time they are valid depending on the specific application or service.
