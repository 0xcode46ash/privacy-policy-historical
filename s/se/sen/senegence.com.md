01\. Types of information collected on SeneGence.com 

There are two types of information collected on SeneGence.com:   
Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. 

Personally Identifiable Information  
Personally Identifiable Information (“personal information”) is information that identifies you as an individual, such as your name, mailing address, email address, age range, etc. Personal information is only obtained when you voluntarily provide the information to us. SeneGence uses personal information to better understand your needs and interests and to provide you with better service. 

On occasion, SeneGence may ask you to voluntarily submit information about other people. For example, this may be done to send them a link to a web page or sign them up for a promotion. 

Once you choose to provide us with personal information, you can be assured it will be used only to support your relationship with SeneGence. We take seriously the trust you place in us and will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others.

We may also collect non-personal information that you voluntarily provide, such as information included in response to a questionnaire or survey.

_**03\. How we collect information**_

SeneGence collects data when you provide information to us or through the use of web technology. 

Information Collected Through You:

If you choose to use certain services on SeneGence.com, we may require you to provide contact and identity information. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. If you choose not to use a particular service or feature, you do not have to provide the contact or identity information it calls for. 

Non-Personally Identifiable Information Collected Through Technology:

Cookies:   
SeneGence.com may use cookie technology to improve your experience on SeneGence.com and gather data for web site statistical reporting. Cookie technology does not capture your individual email address or any personal information about you. 

A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a web site that is saved on your hard disk by your computer’s browser. It holds information a site may need to personalize your experience (i.e., rotating images on SeneGence.com home page) and gathers web site statistical data, such as which pages are visited, what is downloaded, the Internet provider’s domain name and country that our visitors come from and the addresses of sites visited immediately before and after coming to SeneGence.com. However, none of this is associated with you as an individual and is measured only in aggregate. 

To browse without cookies, you can configure your browser to reject all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) Your experience of the SeneGence.com site may be different if you set your browser to block cookies. 

_Web Beacons:_  
SeneGence.com may use web beacons to serve advertising, enhance email advertising and track usage on SeneGence.com. We use third parties to manage web beacons and the data they collect. Web beacons do not capture your individual email address or any other personal information. 

Web beacons, also called clear GIFs (a common format for image files), are invisible files on web pages that you visit. If you visit a page on SeneGence.com that contains a web beacon, it communicates with your computer to determine, among other things, whether you have been to that page before or viewed a particular advertisement. 

_IP Address:_  
SeneGence.com may collect IP addresses for the purposes of systems administration, server problem diagnosis and compiling aggregate information (such as how many visitors logged on to SeneGence.com). When you visit a particular web page on SeneGence.com, our servers log your IP address. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer automatically when you use the Internet.

04\. Who we share information with 

We take seriously the trust you place in us and will not sell, rent or lease your information to others. 

SeneGence may also work with other companies (“partners”) to provide co-branded services or promotions. To provide a co-branded service to you, it may be necessary for us to share your personal information with our partners. The partner will only be able to use the information as necessary to perform the requested service or in aggregate form for statistical reporting. 

Remember, if you go to other web sites, including those of our partners, advertisers, merchants and other sites that link to our site, those other sites may collect personal and non-personal information about you. The information practices of those other sites are not covered by this Privacy Policy. We have no liability or responsibility for those sites or their own policies. 

Disclosure of personal information for legal purposes and protection of SeneGence.com and others: SeneGence.com reserves the right to share your personal information with third parties if we believe such action is necessary in order to: (a) conform with the requirements of the law or to comply with legal process served upon us; (b) protect or defend our legal rights or property, SeneGence.com or our users; or (c) investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or violations of the terms and conditions of using SeneGence.com.
