**(e)** We provide User information to trusted partners in order to enhance the service provided to our Users 

**III. CO-REGISTRATION**

1\. **Definition**

SendEarnings signup pages may contain co-registration checkboxes, where Users can choose to "co-register" for other Web Sites during their registration with SendEarnings by checking the checkbox next to the co-registration Offer. Users are not required to select any co-registration boxes to join SendEarnings; however, they may be required to do so in order to qualify for Signup Bonus(es) and/or other promotions. 

2\. **Information Sharing**

When a User co-registers for an Offer by checking the co-registration checkbox, any information they provide to SendEarnings may be shared with the Advertiser associated with the co-registration Offer. SendEarnings cannot control what Advertisers subsequently do with that information. 

**IV. COOKIES**

1\. **Referral and Affiliate Tracking**

SendEarnings uses cookies in order to track new User registrations. This ensures Users are properly credited for referring other Users, as well as to track earnings for our Affiliates. 

2\. **User Recognition**

After a User has logged into the SendEarnings Member's Section, cookies are used to remember their Username and Password so they do not need to be entered during every visit to our Web Site. Users can logout of the Member's Section if they do not wish to have this information saved. 

3\. **Cookies are Safe!**

Cookies used by SendEarnings can only be seen by SendEarnings, and cannot in any way cause harm to your computer. Because we cannot properly track user actions without the use of Cookies (to ensure Users are credited for completing Offers, referring friends, etc), our Web Site will not function properly for Users who have Cookies disabled.
