The Information We Collect 

Any information that you provide through the SendEarnings.com registration process or responses to offers made available to you through our site is completely voluntary. You always have a choice whether or not to disclose information requested in the survey, registration or offer form or to remain opted-in as a SendEarnings user. The information we collect includes contact and postal information (such as name, mailing address and telephone number), e-mail address and demographic information (such as age, interests and other information). SendEarnings does not collect sensitive data like credit card information or Social Security numbers. 

We also think that you should be rewarded for the time it takes to fill out our survey. That's why we provide incentives. In part, that's also why we cannot accept information from those under the age of 18 years. Those under 18 cannot participate in sweepstakes and promotions offered by SendEarnings or the promotion sponsor. In addition, we do not knowingly collect, use or disseminate any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If, however, we become aware that personally identifiable information regarding a child under the age of 13 has been collected, we will delete it from our records. We encourage parents and guardians to participate in and supervise the online activities of their children. 

How We Use It 

Your information will be used to improve and personalize the offers SendEarnings sends to you and all our members. When you choose to receive additional information from SendEarnings, we add your e-mail address to our e-mail subscription list. SendEarnings may send you emails regarding marketing offers from other reputable organizations whose products and services we think you might find interesting. Contact, postal, e-mail address and demographic information may be shared with third party marketers. In addition, SendEarnings provides services for direct marketing applications including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation.
