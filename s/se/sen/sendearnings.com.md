  1. #### About Cookies and Third Party Technology.

A “cookie” is a small data file that may be saved to and stored on your computer when you visit a website or open an email. Cookies permit a website to “remember” whether your computer has visited the website before and helps the website create a more personalized experience for you and records activities taken by you, such as offers completed. 

In addition to cookie technology, SendEarnings® and our Advertisers use additional third party technology and tracking tools to record offers and activities completed by you, friends referred by you, and to communicate information about you, such as demographic information (e.g., age, gender), in order to target offers and advertisements to specific groups as requested by Advertisers.

However, if you do not accept Cookies and Recording Tools used by SendEarnings® and our Advertisers, you may not be able to use certain functions on certain websites. More importantly, if you do not accept Cookies and Recording Tools you will not receive credit for offers or other actions completed by you because we and our Advertisers are unable to track and record your activity.
