  3. ## CO-REGISTRATION

    1. ### Definition

SendEarnings signup pages may contain co-registration checkboxes, where Users can choose to “co-register” for other Web Sites during their registration with SendEarnings by checking the checkbox next to the co-registration Offer. Users are not required to select any co-registration boxes to join SendEarnings; however, they may be required to do so in order to qualify for Signup Bonus(es) and/or other promotions. 

    2. ### Information Sharing

When a User co-registers for an Offer by checking the co-registration checkbox, any information they provide to SendEarnings may be shared with the Advertiser associated with the co-registration Offer. SendEarnings cannot control what Advertisers subsequently do with that information. 

    3. ### Privacy on Other Sites

This website may contain links to third party websites. We provide these links for your convenience, but we do not review, control or monitor the privacy practices of websites operated by others. We are not responsible for the performance of these sites or for your business dealings with them. Your use of other websites is subject to the terms and conditions of those websites, including the privacy policies of those websites. 

  4. ## COOKIES

    1. ### Referral and Affiliate Tracking

SendEarnings uses cookies in order to track new User registrations. This ensures Users are properly credited for referring other Users, as well as to track earnings for our Affiliates. 

    2. ### User Recognition

After a User has logged into the SendEarnings Member’s Section, cookies are used to remember their Username and Password so they do not need to be entered during every visit to our Web Site. Users can logout of the Member’s Section if they do not wish to have this information saved. 

    3. ### Cookies

Cookies used by SendEarnings can only be seen by SendEarnings. Because we cannot properly track user actions without the use of Cookies (to ensure Users are credited for completing Offers, referring friends, etc), our Web Site will not function properly for Users who have Cookies disabled. 

We also use cookies to track non-personal information such as date and time the website is visited and number of pages viewed. Because non-personal information does not identify the identity of any specific User we may use or disclose non-personal information in any way and with any third party.
