**How do we use cookies and similar technology?**  
Cookies are pieces of text that a website stores on your computer to enable the website to recognize your device, which enables features like shopping preferences, stored shopping cart information, and remembering your password. The Help feature of the toolbar on most browsers and some browser add-ons will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies and how to disable cookies. Because cookies are necessary to take full advantage of the shopping features we offer, we recommend that you leave them on. 

Web beacons are small bits of code in web pages and e-mails. They are used to track website usage and compile sales and statistical data. Web beacons let us know when a purchase is made on one of our websites and when a purchase is initiated by an advertisement we placed on a third party’s website. They also track when e-mails are opened, forwarded, or acted on. We use this information for marketing, managing our websites, and enhancing your shopping experience.

We share or disclose your information only as described in this Policy or at other instances after we obtain your consent.

We share personal information about you when you voluntarily use certain optional Services and features we offer. If you participate in a contest or sweepstakes, we may share the information you submit with others assisting us in the administration of that feature.

They are given access to information to perform these functions.   


**Other Situations.** If you ask us to send a particular product to another person or use our invite a friend feature, we will tell that person we are sending the product or e-mail at your request. If Send the Trend is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale, your information could be among the assets transferred or disclosed, and if your information is transferred, it may be subject to the data use policy of another company. We will protect your information during this process. If a merger, acquisition or sale of Send the Trend is completed and involves the transfer of your information to another company, we will give you notice of the transfer, and we will tell you if your information will be subject to a different data use policy. We may also share information: (1) where permitted by law; (2) to comply with applicable law or requests from public authorities; (3) to address fraud, security, or technical issues; (4) to enforce this Policy, the Terms And Conditions that govern this website and our other Services, and other agreements; and (5) to defend and protect the rights, property, or safety of Send the Trend, our customers, or the public where required or permitted by law.  


We may combine personal and non-personal information we obtain with other information we obtain from third parties.

**How do we protect your information?**  
Send the Trend participates in the GoDaddy Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) Program. When you transmit information to us through a website address beginning with “https” it is encrypted by SSL software. We maintain the servers that store your information in a facility with restricted access. We also truncate your credit card number to the last four digits when we communicate with you about your order. We also restrict access to information to those employees and third parties who need access to perform their business functions, and they may be disciplined or terminated for not protecting the confidentiality of your information.   
While we take these steps to protect your information, no security measure is perfect or impenetrable, and we cannot guaranty the security of information you send to us. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your passwords and any account information.
