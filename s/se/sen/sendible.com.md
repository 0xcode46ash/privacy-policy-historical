Browsing this site doesn't reveal your identity publicly, although see private logging later in this document for more information. If you contribute to this site, this is a public act and you will be identified as the author of the edit. 

  


**Author identification**

At this time, this site is only open to edits by registered users. This is a spam control measure. When logged in, your user name will be visible and acts under that account will be tracked. You may use your real name or not. Note that this is the name that you select when you create an account. When not logged in, actions will be identified by your IP address. These numbers could potentially be traceable to identifying information about you, whether it is your home ISP or the university, college or work account where the IP address is registered. Your IP address could potentially be used in conjunction with other data to identify you. If you are concerned about attempts to match your IP address to your identity, you may wish to use an anonymous browsing service or attempt some means to disguise your real IP address.
