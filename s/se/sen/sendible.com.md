# Our Privacy Policy | Sendible

In order to benefit from the full functionality offered by this web site, it is occasionally necessary for us to place a small amount of information (a cookie) on your computer. Cookies are used to store your viewing options for displaying thumbnail images and text. When you change these options, your new selections are recorded in a cookie for use next time you visit the site.

Where it is possible to make a contribution to this site, these contributions are published, and except in very limited circumstances, will be a permanent part of this site. If you decide to contribute, you must keep this in mind. This privacy policy will be reviewed, and may be revised, from time to time. You may wish to revisit it regularly. ‘We’ as used in this policy refers to Sendible.com.

### Information Gathering and Usage

When you register for Sendible we ask for information such as your name, company name, email address, billing address, credit card information. Members who sign up for the free trial account are not required to enter a credit card. The financial information provided by users who upgrade to our paid plans will be transmitted over an encrypted connection (SSL) to our payment gateway and will not be stored by Sendible Ltd. Sendible Ltd. uses collected information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, billing, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, advertising and research.

### Public data and publishing

Browsing this site doesn’t reveal your identity publicly, although see private logging later in this document for more information. If you contribute to this site, this is a public act and you will be identified as the author of the edit.

### Author identification

At this time, this site is only open to edits by registered users. This is a spam control measure. When logged in, your user name will be visible and acts under that account will be tracked. You may use your real name or not. Note that this is the name that you select when you create an account. When not logged in, actions will be identified by your IP address. These numbers could potentially be traceable to identifying information about you, whether it is your home ISP or the university, college or work account where the IP address is registered. Your IP address could potentially be used in conjunction with other data to identify you. If you are concerned about attempts to match your IP address to your identity, you may wish to use an anonymous browsing service or attempt some means to disguise your real IP address.

### Cookies

Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our site. By continuing to browse the site, you are agreeing to our use of cookies.

A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer if you agree. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer’s hard drive. We use the following cookies:

This information is used to provide site statistics and to get an idea of popular pages and what sites link here. In the normal course of events we do not intend to use these logs to identify legitimate users.

The data logged may be used by us to solve technical problems with the site and, in cases of abuse of this site, to investigate the abuse.

  1. When required by law, such as in response to a valid request from a law enforcement body.

  3. To designated third parties to resolve or investigate abuse complaints.
  4. When the information is related to spiders or bots, usually when investigating technical issues.
  5. For abusive users, we may release information to assist in attempting to block the abusive user or to complain to that user’s Internet Service Provider.
  6. If necessary to defend legal claims against us by third parties.
  7. When we deem it necessary to protect the property or rights of the user community, or this website.
