Protecting your privacy is very important to Return Path. We know that you're concerned with privacy on the Internet, and we've taken many steps to help safeguard your information.

This privacy statement is provided to inform you of our privacy policy and practices and of the choices you can make about the way your personal information is collected online and how that information is used. By personal information we mean information about you collected through this Web site, including your email address, or any other information.

#### The organization collecting information at this Web site

[Return Path](http://www.returnpath.com/ "Go to the Return Path Web site") ("Company" or "we"), operates the website located at [senderscore.org](https://web.archive.org/) (the "Site"). Through the Site, Company operates the Sender Score Reputation Data Lookup Service (the "Service"), by which it allows users who register with us to receive feedback messages from participating Internet Service Providers. Return Path provides this service on behalf of select Internet Service Providers partnered with Return Path.

#### The information we collect

_Collection and Use_  
To simply view the Site without registering for the, you will not be required to provide any personal information.  If you elect to sign-up for the Service, you will be registering with Return Path on the form provided and such registration may require you to provide personally identifiable information such as your name and email address. 

If you provide us with your email address or other personal information, or if we obtain such information about you from you or from one of our marketing partners, we will retain and use that information solely for the purpose of sending email regarding information and changes to our products and services that affect our partners and users, to ensure continuing operation of our web site. We also reserve the right to send these messages whenever an important update to our existing products and services or a new product, feature or functionality becomes available. When necessary, we may also use your personal information to ensure compliance with Company policies and applicable law.

#### With whom it may be shared

Except for the limited situations discussed in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your personal information with third parties. 

As the Company develops, we may buy other businesses or their assets or sell our business assets. Customer information is generally one of the business assets involved in such transactions. Thus, in the event that Company or all of its assets are acquired, customer information, including any visitor information collected through the Site or the Service, would be one of the transferred assets. In the event of corporate change, users will be notified in accordance with the “Changes to these terms” section of the policy if their personal information is provided to the new corporate entity as a result of corporate ownership change.

Finally, Company reserves the right to disclose list member information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Company’s rights or property, other visitors, list members, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Company also reserves the right to disclose visitor or list member information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

#### Aggregate information

From time to time, we may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of the Site and the Service, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Site, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on. We collect this information through the use of technologies such as “cookies” and “IP addresses”, which are discussed in greater detail below. We may also group this information into aggregate visitor data in order to describe the use of the Site and Service to our existing or potential business partners or other third parties, or in response to a government request. However, please be assured that this aggregate data will in no way personally identify you, other list members or any other visitors to the Site.

_IP Addresses_  
An IP address is a number that’s automatically assigned to your computer whenever you’re surfing the web. Web servers, the computers that “serve” web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. Company collects IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to third parties and to track the use of the Site. When visitors request pages from the Site or click on a link in a mailing sent through the Service our servers log the visitors’ IP addresses. We reserve the right to use IP addresses to identify a visitor or list member when it will enhance the users experience or if we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with the Site’s policies or to protect Company, the Site, its visitors, the Service, our Internet Service Provider partners, the list members or others.
