This policy also covers Select's treatment of any personally identifiable information that our business partners share with us or that we may collect on a partner's site.

The Information We Collect

  * We may collect personally identifiable information from you when you access our website or provide information to us through the Site. We also may collect certain information from visitors to the Site through the use of cookies, web logs, server logs, or any other program or device by which web site operators may collect limited personally identifiable information from users of our website.

We also may collect contact information so that we may send to you requested materials, information, and news about Select and its affiliates.
  * Please note, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. The contact information that you may submit to us is not encrypted, and therefore is susceptible to interception and viewing by third parties without your or our knowledge or consent. Although we make every effort to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of that information except while it is in our sole custody and control. Consequently, any Internet transmission of information is made at your own risk. If you prefer, you may contact us via telephone at the numbers identified on the Site.



Disclosure of Personal Information

  * We do not share any personal information that we have collected or that you may have provided to us through our website with any third parties, unless required to do so by legal, judicial, or governmental mandate.
  * Select does not contract with any advertising or marketing agencies to sell or disseminate personal information obtained from you.
  * Select does not contract with any advertising or marketing agencies to gather individual or group profile information from our visitors.



How We Keep Information Secure

  * Information security is one of our highest priorities. This priority is emphasized by our internal employee Code of Conduct, this Privacy Policy, and the contracts and agreements that we sign with external suppliers and partners. Employees who violate our policies and procedures regarding privacy are subject to disciplinary action, and our partners and suppliers are bound to uphold our procedures regarding privacy under the terms of our legal contracts with them. We safeguard information by regularly assessing security standards and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to personal information.
  * We limit access to personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information to maintain and improve our Site and to provide information that you request. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect your personal information.



Links to Other Websites

  * This Site contains links to other websites for your convenience. Many of those websites are for entities that are subsidiaries or affiliates of Select. This Privacy Policy remains in effect when you visit those sites.
  * This Site also contains links to certain third-party websites for your convenience. Select is not responsible for the privacy practices of those websites. We also are not responsible for the nature, quality or accuracy of the content or opinions expressed in such websites, and such websites are not investigated, monitored or checked for quality, accuracy, or completeness by us. Inclusion of any linked website on this Site does not imply or express an approval or endorsement of the linked website, or any of the content, opinions, products, or services provided on those websites. If you decide to leave this Site and access those third-party sites, you do so at your own risk.



Correcting, Updating, and Deleting Personal Information

  * At any time, you may request us to correct, update, or delete personal information that you have voluntarily submitted via email, web form, or similar transmission by submitting an email. 
  * If you choose to delete your personal information from our records, we will delete your name and contact information from our records within a reasonable amount of time. You still may receive some information from us after the date that you submit your deletion request, but only because that information was prepared before your request was processed. 



Notification of Changes

  * In the event that we decide to change any of the terms of this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on our home page so our users are well aware of the information that we collect and how it is collected.
  * In the event that we decide to change the way that we use personally identifiable information, we will notify users via email, and provide users with a choice as to whether we use their information in this new manner.
