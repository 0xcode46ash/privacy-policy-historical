# Privacy policy / Selftrade

**3\. Data Protection**

The Data Protection Act 1998 (“the Act”) regulates the processing of personal information or data. The Act seeks to protect the rights of individuals by (1) setting out the conditions under which the processing of personal information is lawful, (2) the rights of data subjects and (3) the standards of quality that must be maintained. Selftrade is committed to respecting the rights of data subjects and complying with the Act. 

The information given to us by you may contain your or another person’s personal data (“the personal information”). By applying for our services or entering into any agreement with us, whether or not you become a customer, you acknowledge that, in order to process any instruction or enquiry and carry out actions related to any enquiry and/or marketing by us (“the Purpose”), we may use, store or otherwise process any personal information, including that provided by you to us in making any application for the Selftrade service under the agreement between us and you for the provision of the Selftrade service to you, or otherwise in conjunction with your subsequent use of the Selftrade service. You confirm that you are entitled to disclose information about any third party named on an Application Form. You freely consent to the processing and disclosure of your personal information for the Purpose. 

The Purpose mentioned above will also include:  


  * (a) providing the Selftrade service to you, administering your Selftrade account and any agreement between us for the provision of the Selftrade service, 
  * (b) providing services ancillary to any such agreement or service, 
  * (c) marketing to you of financial services and products. 
  * (d) the release of your name, address, e-mail address and telephone number to market research organisations for the purpose of confidential market research surveys carried out by post, telephone or electronically on Selftrade's behalf, 
  * (e) the compliance with a request you make of us, 
  * (f) assessment of financial standing, which will include verification of identity checks, with a credit reference agency,
  * (g) the transfer of information to the Official Receiver or appointed insolvency practioner(s) for the administration of your account if we receive notice of or are informed of your insolvency or bankruptcy or of any insolvency proceedings/arrangements;
  * (h) any use of your personal information to comply with legal or regulatory obligations.



Should the Purpose for which Selftrade uses your personal information change, this page will be updated and a notice will specify the changes. You will have the option to decline to have your personal data held for such changed purposes by notifying us at compliance@selftrade.co.uk. 

We may transfer or disclose personal information to any company within the Société Générale Group, our professional advisers and to such other parties as we consider may assist in the administration of the Selftrade service or the provision of other related services. These parties may be located anywhere in the world. We may also disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or are requested to do so by FSA, the LSE, PLUS Markets or any other regulatory authority in any country. If you receive any savings income from us, your details and the details of your income will be reported to HM Revenue & Customs as required under the EU Savings Tax Directive.

In carrying out an assessment of your financial standing with a credit reference agency, we may also use the services of other companies in our Group. We currently use the services of Squaregain Limited.

For the Purpose described above, personal data may be processed in countries which do not have data protection laws that are as comprehensive as those in the UK. 

Personal data will be retained for a reasonable time after enquiries are received by Selftrade (whether or not an agreement is subsequently entered into) and/or for a reasonable time after any resultant action or agreement has expired. This extends to the retention of such information by Selftrade and/or any company within our group.

You have the right, upon payment of a fee, to receive a copy of the information we hold about you to the extent that it constitutes your personal information. For more details please write to the Data Protection Officer at Selftrade, Boatman’s House, 2 Selsdon Way, London E14 9LA.
