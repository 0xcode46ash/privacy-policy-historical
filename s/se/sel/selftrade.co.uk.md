    Privacy Policy
                                                                                                                                                                                      0845 0700 720
                                                                                                                                                                                      selftrade.co.uk
       We recognise that the personal information you provide to us must be stored and handled in a safe,
       secure manner in order to ensure that it remains confidential. This Privacy Policy sets out our strict
       confidentiality standards, which are designed to protect the information we hold regarding you and
       your Account.
       Equally, you can help us protect your confidential information by ensuring you take sensible steps to
       protect your information, both on and offline; you will find some helpful tips in the section on Personal
       Security.
       Please bear in mind that:
       -S elftrade provides you with a range of tools and information to help you make informed investment
         decisions, but does not provide investment advice. If you are in any doubt as to the risk or suitability of
         an investment or product, you should seek advice from an independent financial adviser.
       1. Your login details
       If you choose to access the secure areas of our Website (the internet website relating to Selftrade with
       the URL of www.selftrade.co.uk or such other website as we may notify you of from time to time),
       which are designed for Account holders only, you are able to access these only with your login details
       (which are provided to you once your Account has been opened, and which only you and any joint holder
       or a person that you have authorised to operate the Account should know). Your login details should
       never be shared with anyone else and we recommend that any password or PIN you set is not easily
       guessable, and changed frequently (at least once a month).
       Because we cannot guarantee the confidentiality of information sent on the internet, you should never
       send your login details via email. Should you wish to contact us about your Dealing or Deposit Account,
       we recommend you do so via the secure message facility accessed from your online Account, which is
       encrypted and offers greater confidentiality.
       2. How we may communicate with you
       a) General communications
       Occasionally, unless you have indicated an objection to receiving such communications, we, our business
       partners or marketing agencies may contact you by way of telephone, email, fax, letter, SMS or other
       electronic messaging services with offers and/or details of new products and services.
       Should you not wish to receive these communications, you can request to be removed from our
       mailings by sending an email with “unsubscribe” in the subject field. If you have registered more than
       one email address with Selftrade, please list all your email addresses to be removed from our mailings
       in the body of the email. Please note that, while we will remove you from future communications, any
       communications already in hand may still be received for a short time after advising us of your request.
       Opting out of communications will not affect the receipt of messages relating to the provision of
       Services you receive from us.
       If, having chosen not to receive communications from us, you then wish to do so, you should email us at
       info@selftrade.co.uk or contact Customer Services on 0845 0700 720.
       You may be contacted by telephone by Gasbox, trading name of 20:20 Dialogue Limited, which is our
       Appointed Representative and which undertakes occasional communications on our behalf, for example
       to customers who may be having difficulties activating their Accounts. As our representative, the caller
       may introduce themselves as calling from Selftrade, but they will always call from the number 01793
       883522.
       If you ever receive a communication from us that you are concerned may be from a third party
       impersonating Selftrade, please contact us immediately. If you are ever concerned that the person
       calling may not be from Selftrade, you can always ask to call us back on our Customer Services phone

       3. How we comply with the Data Protection Act
       The Data Protection Act 1998 (“the Act”) regulates the processing of personal information or data.
       The Act seeks to protect your rights to your data by setting out (1) the conditions under which the
       processing of personal information is lawful, (2) the rights of data subjects and (3) the standards of
       quality that must be maintained. Selftrade is committed to respecting the rights of data subjects and
       complying with the Act.
       The information you give us in your application form, in other related documents or from your use of
       our Services, may contain your or another person’s personal data (“the personal information”). If you
       provide us with information about another person, you confirm that they have appointed you to act
       for them, to consent to the processing of their personal data and that you have informed them of our
       identity and the Purposes (as set out below) for which their personal data will be processed.
       When you visit our Website we may automatically log your IP address, a unique identifier for your
       computer or other access device. We will not use your IP address to identify you in any way.
       By applying for our Services and/or providing personal information to us, whether or not you become
       a customer, you acknowledge that, in order to process any instruction or enquiry and carry out actions
       related to any enquiry and/or marketing by us (“the Purposes”), we may use, store or otherwise
       process your personal information, including (i) information provided by you to us in making any
       application for a Service under the agreement between us and you for the provision of a Service to you,
       (ii) information provided by third parties (eg your employer, joint account holder or other organisations)
       and (iii) information otherwise obtained in conjunction with your subsequent use of the Selftrade
       Service. You confirm that you are entitled to disclose information about any third party named on an
       application form. You freely consent to the processing and disclosure of your personal information for
       the Purposes.
       The Purposes we may process your personal information for may also include:

             between us for the provision of the Selftrade Service;
       (b) providing services ancillary to any such agreement or Service;
       (c) where you have requested a service from third-party providers, introducing you to third-party
            providers (such as Garlik Limited and London Capital Group Limited) and sharing the personal
            information with such third-party providers for this purpose;
       (d) marketing to you of our financial services and products, or other products of a similar or
             complementary nature;

            your behalf, including sharing your information with any debt collection, debt tracing or other agent
            for these purposes;
       (j) any use of your personal information to comply with legal or regulatory obligations.
       Please note: The wording in point (c) was updated on 7 December 2011 to clarify that it will apply only
       where you have requested a service from the respective third-party provider.
       If you have registered for a Member Account, you have the ability to choose to make some of the
       content you may produce using the Member Services (such as forum posts and watchlists) viewable
       to other Members and Website visitors, or to keep it private. This does not include any personal
       information relating to your Account, which cannot be viewed by other Members.
       We may continue to retain some or all of your personal information for a reasonable period after
       termination of our Services to you, or where we are required to do so by any law, regulation or
       regulatory authority. You agree that the Purposes may be amended to include other uses or
       disclosures of personal information following notification to you by secure electronic message on our
       Website or by post.
       Should the Purpose for which Selftrade uses your personal information change, this page will be
       updated and a notice will specify the changes. You will have the option to decline to have your
       personal data held for such changed Purposes by notifying us at info@selftrade.co.uk. We would
       remind customers that, by doing this, it may no longer be possible for Selftrade to provide our Services
       to you.
       We may transfer or disclose personal information to any company within the Société Générale Group,
       to our professional advisers and to such other parties as we consider may assist in the administration
       of the Selftrade Service or the provision of other related services or in connection with a transfer of
       rights and obligations under this Privacy Policy, any insurance policy or contract or in the event that
       our business or its assets are sold or transferred. These parties may be located anywhere in the world.
       We may also disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or are requested to do
       so by FSA, the LSE, PLUS Markets or any other regulatory authority in any country. If you receive any
       savings income from us, your details and the details of your income will be reported to HM Revenue &
       Customs as required under the EU Savings Tax Directive.
       In carrying out an assessment of your financial standing with a credit reference agency, we may also
       use the services of other companies in our Group. We currently use the services of Boursorama and
       Société Générale Securities Services Limited (formerly known as Squaregain Limited).
       For the Purposes described above, your personal data is processed in the European Economic Area
       and may be processed in countries outside the EEA which have the same Data Protection Laws as the
       UK. In the event it is necessary for us to transfer your personal information outside the EEA in order
       to provide the Services relating to your Account, we will ensure adequate safeguards are in place to
       protect your information before making the transfer, and will not transfer data if we cannot be sure it
       is sufficiently protected.
       Personal data will be retained for a reasonable time after enquiries are received by Selftrade (whether
       or not an agreement is subsequently entered into) and/or for a reasonable time after any resultant
       action or agreement has expired. This extends to the retention of such information by Selftrade and/
       or any company within our Group; in addition, we are required by FSA Rules and law to retain some
       information for specified time periods.
       If you do not wish to receive marketing materials from us, you should inform us of this using the
       methods described in section 2 above.
       You have the right, upon payment of a fee, to receive a copy of the information we hold about you
       to the extent that it constitutes your personal information. For more details please write to the Data
       Protection Officer at Selftrade, Boatman’s House, 2 Selsdon Way, London E14 9LA. If you have any
       queries on this policy you can contact us at info@selftrade.co.uk
