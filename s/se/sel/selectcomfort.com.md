# Select Comfort -->Privacy & Security Statement

_Protecting your privacy and ensuring that your shopping experience is safe and secure is important to us._

**What do we do with the customer data that you provide when placing an order on our Web site?**  
The data you provide when placing an order will only be used to process your order. Any other information you provide is held with the utmost care and security and will not be used in ways to which you have not consented. Select Comfort will not sell, trade or share any information regarding individual customers. However, Select Comfort may share non-personal aggregate or summary information regarding its customers, sales, Web site traffic patterns, and related Web site information with partners or third-party vendors. 

If we decide to change our Privacy and Security Policy, we will update this Policy so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. 

**What does Select Comfort do to ensure a secure shopping experience?**   
We understand that you may be concerned about providing your personal information and credit card information online. Please be assured that we have taken precautions to ensure your shopping experience is safe and secure. When you place an online order it is transmitted via industry standard secure protocol commonly referred to as SSL (secure socket layer). The SSL technology that works with Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and America Online encrypts (scrambles) the information you input when placing an order, to protect against unauthorized access when the data is transmitted over the Internet. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access.

**Why do we ask for an e-mail address and what is done with it?**   
Your e-mail address is collected at the time of purchase so we can easily and quickly communicate with you regarding the status of your order. Additionally, when you purchase products from Select Comfort, we will automatically place you on our list to receive e-mail updates regarding special offers, new products, "Comfort Club," changes to the Web site and newsletters. We will not sell or give out e-mail addresses.

**Do we use cookies and what are they?**  
Select Comfort uses a feature of your Internet Web browser called a "cookie" to assign a unique identification to your computer. Cookies are files that your Web browser places on your computer's hard drive. Select Comfort creates and then uses these cookie files to track your clicks as you go through the Select Comfort Web site.

Select Comfort does not and cannot use cookies to retrieve personal information from your computer unless you knowingly and willingly provide such information. Select Comfort will not use cookies to store personal information, such as credit card numbers, nor can any Web site other than ours read the information we store in the cookie.
