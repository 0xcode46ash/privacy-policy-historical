# SellPoint Privacy Policy

#### Scope of Privacy Policy 

#### This Privacy Policy applies to sellpoints' online method of collection and use of anonymous, non-personally identifiable information (“Non-PII”) gathered by us for sellpoints' website, www.Sellpoints.net, as well as content hosted and served by sellpoints on third-party websites and on sellpoints' website. (“sellpoints Content”). 

#### Who is sellpoints and how does sellpoints interact with consumers on the web? 

#### Sellpoints (“sellpoints”, “we”, or “us”) is in the business of presenting enhanced product content on the pages of online shopping websites; generally in the form of product tours featuring “rich media; videos, 360° views, and other product collateral. 

#### We do this by utilizing sellpoints proprietary technology (the “Technology”) to create, host, and integrate content provided to us by manufacturers into the product pages of online retailers of consumer products. In order to provision this service, our Technology collects certain anonymous, Non-PII information. Non-PII does not include information that can be used to identify an individual person. The Non-PII we collect may include the date and time of a visit to an online retail website, the pages or product information viewed during that visit, and the sellpoints content that were clicked for view. Sellpoints does not collect or maintain any personally identifiable information (“PII”). This means that we do not accept or use your name, address, email address, or any sensitive information such as your credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, or medical records to provide our online merchandising service. 

#### How does sellpoints collect this information? 

#### When a consumer visits our website or a website where our Technology is enabled, a sellpoints "cookie" may be placed on the consumer' machine. Information collected from cookies is not linked to PII and no PII is transferred in the sellpoints cookie. Sellpoints knows that consumer only by an anonymous ID, so that we can ensure that shoppers have the option to view product information that is the most relevant to the consumer' presumed interests. Again, we don't know who the consumer is, we just know the consumer' preferences through that ID. 

#### What is a "Cookie"? 

#### A cookie is an industry-standard small data file placed on a consumer' computer through your browser by visiting various websites. Cookies allow marketers to "remember you" when you return to their website. Cookies are used by sellpoints to link this anonymous data to non-identified unique users. Again, no PII is transferred in the sellpoints cookie and sellpoints cookies do not track the consumer outside this site or the websites containing sellpoints content or sellpoints technology. Only Non-PII is transferred in the sellpoints cookies. 

#### How is the information used, and who is it shared with? 

#### We use the anonymous information we collect for purposes of analyzing the volume and activity of unique viewers of sellpoints content in order to better understand such factors as the portion of consumers who choose to view sellpoints-hosted content, the components of content receiving the most views, and other aggregate behavioral information. The aggregate information we collect is provided to our manufacturers and retailers. 

#### Safeguarding Information We Collect and Use 

#### The security of your information is important to us. We have implemented appropriate security measures to protect the information in our care, both during transmission and once we receive it. We take physical and technical security measures to protect our data from unauthorized access, as well as unauthorized disclosure or destruction of data. 

#### Privacy of Children 

#### We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. Neither sellpoints' website nor sellpoints' online activities with its Marketing Partners are intended or designed to attract children under the age of 13. As stated above we do not collect Personal Information from any person and therefore we do not collect Personal Information from a person we actually know is a child under the age of 13. 

#### Opting Out of the Services 

#### We provide multiple ways for you to opt out of non PII data gathering by sellpoints: 

#### We make available a sellpoints "opt-out" cookie that you may download to your browser. This cookie, when installed on your browser, will prevent sellpoints from collecting Non-PII on that browser. You can download our opt-out cookie by clicking [here](http://www.sellpoint.net/home/optout.php). 

#### Additionally, you may prevent us from collecting Non-PII on a browser by blocking all third-party cookies in that browser. If you block all third-party cookies from being set on your browser, you may not be able to enjoy some features or functionality of certain websites. 

####   
Our opt-out tools are cookie-based. Both opt-out tools only prevent us from collecting Non-PII pertaining to you on the browser on which they are installed, and will only function if your browser is set to accept third-party cookies. Consumers have the capability of deleting cookies on their machine; however, if they enjoy the convenience of a website remembering them, consumers are advised not to delete their cookies. If you delete an opt-out cookie from a browser' cookie files, we will collect Non-PII from that browser until an opt-out cookie is reset on that browser. However, we shall not collect any PII as set forth above. 

#### Disclosure Polices 

#### Sellpoints reserves the right and may disclose any information in our possession if such disclosure is necessary to (i) prevent or detect fraud, security and technical issues, (ii) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental or law enforcement request, (iii) protect an individual from imminent harm or an individual' safety, and (iv) enforce these Privacy Policies and sellpoints' Terms of Use. 

#### Links to and Information from Third Party Websites 

#### Sellpoints may provide links to or reference material from third party websites or you may visit third party websites in the viewing of sellpoints Content or the use of the sellpoints Technology. Such links or reference material is provided to you for your convenience and information. Sellpoints does not control those sites and if you access these links or materials, please refer to the third party website for their privacy policies. Those third party websites likely use their own cookies, pixels and other information gathering technology to collect data or solicit information from you. Sellpoints is not responsible for and specifically disclaims any responsibility for their privacy practices, policies, collection of data or information or the content of such third parties. We also do not endorse nor make any representations about third party websites.
