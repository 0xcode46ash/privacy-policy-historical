# SELCO Credit Union: Privacy Policy

  


**SELCO Credit Union**  
At SELCO Credit Union, your privacy and the security of your personal information is our utmost concern any time we communicate with you on the Internet. SELCO Credit Union maintains strict guidelines regarding your privacy and you can be sure that your transactions with SELCO Credit Union will always be safe and secure. 

**Our privacy policy is simple** : Under no circumstances will SELCO Credit Union sell or share any personal information about you to or with any external person or organization except as authorized by you, or as may be required by law or court order.

Our commitment to protect your financial information from any outside party is described under the principles and guidelines detailed below.

**Information We Collect**  
SELCO Credit Union does not collect personally identifying information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals.

For site management, information is collected for statistical purposes. SELCO Credit Union's computer system uses software programs to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as assessing what information is of most and least interest to members, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas.

SELCO Credit Union may place a "cookie" on the browser of a SELCO Credit Union visitor's computer. A cookie is a small data file that many web sites store on your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive or read cookie files created by other sites. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information. A cookie can be used to tell when your computer has contacted a web site; we use this information for statistic purposes such as delivery of advertisements, so we can customize delivery of content to better match your interests and preferences without compromising privacy. For example, cookies are used to ensure that you don't see the same ad too many times in a single session. The sole purpose of the cookie used by SELCO Credit Union is to track how you found us.

With most Internet browsers you can erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions.

We do not require you to have your cookies turned on when visiting our main web site area, however, you must have cookies turned on to enter Web Personal Branch, our online banking service. Cookies are a requirement for Web Personal Branch to function properly. 

**Information You Provide**  
Personal information includes all of the personally-identifying information that you provide us voluntarily online. You may give us personal information when you apply for membership or for a loan, request an account or service, use online banking (Web Personal Branch or Bill Payer), or when you send us email.

Depending on the type of information received, the information is sent through the SELCO Credit Union system and is presented either to an authorized Financial Service Associate (FSA) or to authorized members of our Information Services Department. For example, any loan application information you supply goes directly to an FSA for processing into our database. Approvals are usually returned online. In this case only, our FSAs may contact you via phone or email to verify information for accuracy. 

The majority of information supplied by you to us, however, comes in the form of user feedback, questions, and concerns, all of which are logged into a customer feedback database for future consideration and problem solving in order to improve the site to meet your needs. 

We do not control the privacy policies of our business partners, advertisers, sponsors and other sites to which we provide hyperlinks. For information regarding external sites, contact the site owner regarding privacy policies. 

**Children** : Be sure to request parental permission before you send any information about yourself over the Internet.

  
**Your Consent**  
By using SELCO Credit Union's web site, you consent to the collection and use of nonpersonal information by SELCO Credit Union. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page, so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it.
