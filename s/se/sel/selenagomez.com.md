## Correcting, Updating or Removing Your Information

At any time, members can correct, update, or remove any of their personal information by logging into their account and accessing the “Edit Profile” feature.

## How We Use the Information

We collect the personal information listed above so that we can provide you with personalized features and an enhanced and efficient web site experience. We usually retain this information so you can, for example, view messages you have already read or check campaign dates you are already aware of. You understand and acknowledge that copies of your User Content may remain viewable in cached and/or archived pages or if other members have copied and/or stored your User Content, even after your information has been removed.

When you sign up as a member to the network, you create your own profile. Your profile information, including your name and your photo are displayed to other members in the network so that you may interact and communicate with them. On occasion, we may use your name and email address to send you notifications about the network’s new services, promotional items, merchandise, band news, and transactions involving your accumulated points. Generally, you may opt out of such emails by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link in the email. However, the network expressly reserves the right to send you notices about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications.

Without identifying you as an individual, the network may provide third parties with information contained in your profile for data gathering purposes (ex: gathering data on how many members like both band A and band B so that personalized advertisements, promotions, etc. can be sent to those particular members). We believe that this information gathering allows each member to get the most out of the network’s benefits—e.g., the distribution of band information that, based on your profile, matters to you.

## Sharing Your Information with Third Parties

This web site is about sharing information with others of your choosing, and a limited number of third parties, to enhance each member’s promotional and informational-sharing experience. Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, the network does not disclose personal information to any third party unless the network believes that disclosure is necessary to:

  1. Enforce the network’s Terms and Conditions of Use Agreement;
  2. Protect the network’s rights;
  3. Coincide with legal requirements (ex: responding to a subpoena, search warrant, or any other legal process served upon Ground(ctrl)™). We will not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that the law enforcement information and/or private litigant request meets the applicable legal standards;
  4. Protect the safety of it’s members; or
  5. Enhance each member’s promotional and informational-sharing experience.



The network may provide services jointly with other companies and we may share customer information with that company in connection with your use of that service.

Your name, network names, and profile picture thumbnail will be available in search results across the network and those limited pieces of information may be made available to third party search engines. This is primarily so your friends can find you and send a friend request. People who see your name in searches, however, will not be able to access your profile information unless they have a relationship to you that allows access based on the privacy settings.

Ground(ctrl)™ expressly reserves the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires the rights to that information as a result of the sale of Ground(ctrl)™, or the sale of a substantial portion of its assets to that successor in interest.

## Third-Party Advertising

Advertising may appear on this web site and may be delivered to members by one of our web advertising partners. Those web advertising partners may download cookies to your computer that allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. The web advertising partners may also use other technologies such as JavaScript and “web beacons” (also known as “1x1 gifs”) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content.

This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by our network only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third-party advertiser.

## Comments, Blogs, Messages, and Links

Additionally, if you post a link to your network web site on any third party site, your public profile will be viewable by any third party that clicks on your link. If you do not wish to have your public profile viewable to any third party, you should not post links to your network web site on third party sites.

The network does, however, consider security of each member’s personal information a priority and we take reasonable security steps to protect that information.
