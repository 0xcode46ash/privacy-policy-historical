We are committed to protecting your privacy and to developing our site to give you the most product information of any Australian building industry web site. You are welcome to use our site for a limited period without providing any personal details. However we do ask that you tell us some basic information about yourself as we are always striving to build a better site and make more regular contact with our user base. This Statement of Privacy explains our undertaking not to pass on any of your details without your prior knowledge and consent.

**Collecting your Personal Details**  
We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you wish to contact a company who has a product information listing on Selector.com. Other times we ask are before you enter a contest or order e-mail newsletters. Personal Details collected by Selector.com is often limited to name, e-mail address, and profession, but may include other information when needed to provide a service you requested.  
For example: If you request further information about one of the products listed on Selector.com we require your address, telephone, facsimile and other contact details in order to facilitate this contact.  
Registering on Selector.com assigns a personal identification number and sends it to your computer in the form of a small text file, called a "cookie." The use of this cookie allows you to visit our site again without having to sign inagain.

**Use of your Personal Details**  
We use your Personal Details for three primary purposes: 

  1. To make the site easier for you to use by not making you enter your Personal Details more than once.  

  2. To analyse areas of our site in order to make improvements.  

  3. To report to the companies who list product information on Selector.com general information about who is viewing their product information. This information is limited to summaries of profession and postcodes that we send out with our monthly reports of total numbers of page views, categories views, etc. It does not include name, address, email, telephone or any other information by which people can identify you. For a sample of these statistics please contact us.  


From time to time we are approached by third parties who wish to contact Selector.com users directly. We undertake not to provide them with your details, rather we will feature their information as part of our regular contact with our users. Selector.com will disclose your Personal Details, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary. In all cases we will inform you of any such action forthwith.

**Control of your Personal Details**  
When you register, or otherwise give us your Personal Details, Selector.com will not share that information with third parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions already listed. It will only be used for the purposes stated above. We do not rent our email list to anyone.

**Access to your Personal Details**  
We will provide you with the means to ensure that your Personal Details is correct and current. You may review and update this information at any time by choosing "Update Details" on our site.  
You can: 

  1. View and edit Personal Details you have already given us. 
  2. Tell us whether you want to receive our fortnightly email newsletter. 

You may contact us at any time to obtain a full copy of all of the details we have on file.

**Updating your Personal Details**  
As a security measure, we require you to enter some or all of the following fields exactly as they appear in our records.  
First Name, Surname, Email Address, Date Of Birth, Suburb  
This is to ensure that other people do not have access to any Personal Details stored by Selector.com.
