PRIVACY POLICY (Version 1.1; Revised March 1, 2005)

We have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for this web site.

**Registration Forms**  
The ServiceUptime registration form requires users to provide their e-mail address, other contact information, and optionally credit card billing information. This information is kept confidential and will only be used for account verification and notifications to the email address listed on your account and will never be disclosed or sold. Your e-mail address and other contact information will never be shared with a third party. Your credit card billing information will be used only for authorization and settlement of charges you incur by using our services or buying our products.

**Security**  
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Because our service is subscription-based, it may be necessary to keep your credit card billing information in our database depending on the services you select. When you create or update your account, including credit card information, your session will be encrypted by our secure server (SSL). Once your credit card information has been entered it will be stored in an encrypted format.

**Information Automatically Logged**  
ServiceUptime logs your IP address while you are visiting our site so we can understand how to improve our site's navigation, etc. If you log into a user account on our site, ServiceUptime saves your IP address with your user record to help protect ourselves from fraudulent use.

**Cookies**  
ServiceUptime occasionally uses "cookies", which allows us to recognize who you are at subsequent visits to our site and to your member control panel. The cookies are used for no other purpose than to allow you to navigate our site, and to automatically log you in when you return. You can change your browser settings to accept or reject cookies.

**External Links**  
This site contains links to other sites. ServiceUptime is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites.
