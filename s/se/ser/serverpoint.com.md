# Privacy Policy - Server Point

For ServerPoint your privacy is very important. All of our employee's sign strict non-disclosure agreements. This makes them liable for any unauthorized information disclosure about the company's business or its customers. As in any business we gather important information about our customers. We believe that you as our customer have the right to know how this information is used.

ServerPoint is in the business of web hosting, not marketing. We use you personal data for internal purposes only, contact information, billing information, technical information, usage information and reseller information. The use of this information is mainly to assure quality service for our customers, and of course collect payment. On the other hand, visitor information is also use for internal purposes only. We conduct research with this data to improve our marketing strategy. In addition, we will not use any of this information to sell data or spam users, customers or visitors. ServerPoint also stores all correspondence between us and our customers for record keeping and historical service reference.

When you order web hosting services ("Services") from us, you are required to provide certain personal information to us to allow us to process your order, start providing you with the Services you order from us, and to administer and service your account and provide ongoing technical support. The information you provide to us and that we maintain in our customer account records ranges from basic contact information, to credit card and other payment information, to technical information about your web site. You must provide all of the information we request from you when purchasing our Services. When you purchase our Services, you agree to provide and maintain accurate, complete and updated information.

These communications are essential to our relationship with you and to our ability to provide you with quality Services that are responsive to your needs. As a result, we may maintain information about our communications with you for future use.

We may at times use cookies, which are small pieces of information that a Web site can store in a designated file on your computer. Cookies allow a Web application to respond to you as an individual.

This means that we know what is happening in our servers, thus safeguarding the integrity of its databases.
