Sermo hereby notifies You of the following:

  1. What personally identifiable information is collected from You through this Site.
  2. How the information is used.

### 1\. WHAT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OF YOURS IS COLLECTED

#### a. Information collection and use

Sermo is the sole owner of the information collected on this Site. We will not sell, share, transfer or rent any personal information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement and the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/aux/terms). Sermo collects information from You on the Profile and Registration pages ("Profile pages") on our Site. Sermo reserves the right to collect, disseminate, sell or otherwise disclose non-personal information provided by You.

#### b. Registration

During the collection of information at the Profile pages on the Site, You are required to give your contact information (such as name, address, birth date, physician license information, medical school, institutional affiliations, e-mail address and the like). An e-mail address and birth date is used to confirm Your identity. An email address is also used to contact You about the materials and information on the Site. When the Site requests Your identity, the Site will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. All of your professional information will be authenticated against a third party provider.

#### c. Personal Profile

Once a registered participant, You may provide additional information in Your personal profile describing your credentials, professional experiences, academic background, biography and the like. Your personal profile shall be available for viewing by other registered participants of Sermo and will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary. Providing additional information in Your personal profile beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional and can be altered or removed by You at any time.

#### d. IP Addresses

Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers that serve as that computer's Internet Protocol or "IP" address. When You request a page from any page within the Site, our Web servers automatically recognize Your domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about You other than the IP address from which You have accessed the Site.

For the purposes of inviting and introducing third parties to Sermo, You will be given the option to import or otherwise provide email addresses of third parties to Sermo. In so doing, Sermo will not store or disseminate your username or affiliated password nor solicit or spam any third party email addresses so provided.

#### e. Third Party Email Addresses

For the purposes of inviting and introducing third parties to Sermo, You will be given the option to import or otherwise provide email addresses of third parties to Sermo. On so doing, Sermo will not store your username or affiliated password.

#### f. Children's and Minor's Privacy

Sermo strongly encourages parents and guardians to supervise the online activities of their minor children and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers to help provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools also can prevent minors from disclosing their name, address, and other personally identifiable information online without parental permission. Although the Site is not intended for use by minors, Sermo respects the privacy of minors who may inadvertently use the Internet.

#### g. Opt Out Procedures

Upon initial communication from Sermo, You may opt-out of receiving further communications from Sermo. To be completely removed from the Sermo mailing list, You may contact [admin@sermo.com](mailto:admin@sermo.com). If You are using an e-mail forwarding service or other similar service please make sure to include the correct e-mail address or addresses.

### 2\. HOW THE INFORMATION IS USED

#### a. Use of Personal Health Information

Sermo does not collect personal health information about individuals. To submit a Ticket, You must provide and submit information to the Sermo server. Within Your uploaded submission, Sermo does not collect or maintain information that would associate this submission with a specific patient or individual.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) privacy rule, which took effect on April 14, 2003, allows for the use of de-identified health information so long as identifiers have been "stripped" and a key is not disclosed that would allow the information to be re-identified. Sermo does not possess a key to re-identify patient data.

#### b. Sale of Assets, Merger, Acquisition, Bankruptcy

Information collected from You may be transferred to a third party as a result of a sale or acquisition, merger or bankruptcy involving Sermo.

#### c. Cookies
