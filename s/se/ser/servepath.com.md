# ServePath: Privacy Policy (AUP)

**ServePath Privacy Policy**

ServePath's policies and procedures for handling customer information have been created with the understanding that Internet technologies are still evolving and that Internet business methods are continuing to evolve to meet the needs and opportunities of the changing technologies. As a result, ServePath's policies and procedures are subject to change. 

In the course of serving its customers, ServePath acquires, stores and transmits customer communications and information that customers may regard as private or sensitive. Some of this information - such as the customer's name, address, telephone number, and credit card data - is provided to ServePath by its customers in order to establish service. Other information - such as the customer's account status, choice of services, and customer logs - is created and maintained by ServePath in the normal course of providing service. ServePath also uses cookies, which are small pieces of information that a web site can store in a designated file on a user's computer for various reasons. For example, ServePath uses cookies on the landing pages of products sold online which record the customer information that is required on the order form. This information is then forwarded to an internal sales tracking database within ServePath. In addition, ServePath may store customers' electronic mail and other communications as a necessary incident to the transmission and delivery of those communications. 

**Data Security**

ServePath will protect the confidentiality of its customers' information, account information and personal communications to the fullest extent possible and consistent with the law and the legitimate interests of ServePath, its partners, its employees and other customers of ServePath's services. To protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of information that is collected from customers, ServePath has appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in place. 

**How is customer information used?**

ServePath may share customer information with selected partners, for example, to provide customers with information about products which might be of interest to the customer or to enable the customer to take advantage of special partner programs. ServePath may also use customer information to provide its customers with system information or information about new or upgraded products.

**Opt Out & Modifications**

Customers may opt out of receiving notices of new or upgraded products from ServePath and ServePath partners by sending an Email to support@servepath.com. However, customers may not opt out of receiving information from ServePath which is essential for maintaining or updating customers' accounts or system information. 

Most customers may access and modify their personal information via their online personal control panel/account information page. All other customers may access and modify their personal information by contacting the appropriate ServePath Billing organization.

**Disclosure of customer information and communications**

ServePath will not otherwise disclose its customers' personal and account information unless ServePath has reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, make contact with, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing harm or interfering with the rights or property of ServePath, ServePath's customers, or others, or where ServePath has a good faith belief that the law requires such disclosure.

ServePath also will not, except for reasons stated below, disclose to third parties the contents of any electronic mail or other electronic communications that ServePath stores or transmits for its customers. The circumstances under which ServePath will disclose such electronic customer communications are when:

  1. it is necessary in order to provide service to the customer; 
  2. it is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of ServePath and its customers; 
  3. it is required to cooperate with interception orders, warrants, or other legal process that ServePath determines in its sole discretion to be valid and enforceable; and 
  4. it is necessary to provide to a law enforcement agency when the contents are inadvertently obtained by ServePath and appear to pertain to the commission of a crime.



ServePath disclaims any intention to censor, edit or engage in ongoing review or surveillance of communications stored on or transmitted through its facilities by customers or others. ServePath will, however, review, delete or block access to communications that may harm ServePath, its customers or third parties. The grounds on which ServePath may take such action include, but are not limited to, actual or potential violations of ServePath's Acceptable Use Policy.
