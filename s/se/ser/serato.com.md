## Introduction

Serato Inc Limited Partnership, "Serato", own and run several websites, namely [Serato.com](http://serato.com/), [ScratchLive.net](http://scratchlive.net/) and [Whitelabel.net](http://whitelabel.net/), collectively "Serato Websites".

Serato Websites are run on a number of servers leased by Serato and located in the USA, collectively "Serato Servers". During your use of Serato Websites, Serato collects assorted information about your specific website usage. Additionally, you may be asked to provide us with personally identifying information that enables us to provide you with website personalisation options and/or various online services. This document describes what information we collect, when we collect it, what we use the information for and to whom we may disclose it.  Serato may update this statement from time to time so you are encouraged to periodically revisit this page for the latest Serato Website Privacy Policy.

## Who does this Privacy Policy apply to?

This privacy policy applies to anyone using Serato Websites. If you have entered into any other agreements with Serato which set out further terms of your use of Serato Websites, then those terms will apply in addition to this Privacy Policy.

## What information do we collect?

The information collected by Serato Websites can be broadly separated into two categories: 1) Non-Identifiable Information and 2) Identifiable Information.

### Non-Identifiable Information

All usage activities on Serato Websites are subject to the collection of the following Non-Identifiable Information:

  * The date and time of your website activity
  * The URL address of web pages and other documents and files that you download
  * Your IP address
  * Your referral address (ie. the previous website location that you visited)
  * Your computer's operating system and the type of web browser you use.



This information is considered non-personal because it provides no uniquely identifying information about you.

### Identifiable Information

Participation in certain Serato Websites services requires certain Identifiable Information from you. Examples of services requiring Identifiable Information include participating in forum discussions, making online product purchases and downloading certain content.

The provision of Identifiable Information is left to your the discretion. However, by not providing certain information we may be unable to provide you with certain services.

Identifiable Information is comprised of **Personal Information** and **Activity Information**.

Personal Information is your description of yourself in the User Profile section of Serato Websites, and any contact information you provide.

In some cases Personal Information is made available to other users of Serato Websites. Public Personal Information is clearly marked as "Public" on the forms that collect it.

In other cases Personal Information is only visible to yourself and to Serato employees and trusted third parties for the purposes of after sales support and ongoing product development. Private Personal Information is clearly marked as "Private" on the forms that collect it.

Activity Information includes forum posts written by you, records of downloads, and other activity that is not in the User Profile section of the Serato Websites.

### A Note about Credit Card and Bank Account Information

Serato Servers never store highly sensitive bank account and credit card information.  Purchases from the Serato Websites online stores that require the inputting of credit card information are redirected to a specialised, accredited credit card payment service, Direct Payment Solutions (DPS), for the purposes of acquiring and processing credit card data.

For further information about DPS please read their [Privacy Policy](http://www.paymentexpress.com/about/about_paymentexpress/privacy_policy.html) and [Legal Notice](http://www.paymentexpress.com/about/about_paymentexpress/legal_notice.html).

## How is the information collected?

Non-Identifiable Information is collected via Google Inc.'s Google Analytics web analysis service. Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are small text files stored on your computer that can identify your web usage patterns throughout our websites from one page visit to another. Google stores your usage information on the their own servers and uses it to generate reports of activity on our websites. This information is made available to Serato and may also be used in reports provided to third parties at Google's discretion. Google may also provide this information to third parties if required to do so by law. Google do not associate IP address collected via Google Analytics with IP addresses collected via other Google services (eg. Gmail).

For further information on Google Analytics please read Google's [Terms of Service](http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html) and [Privacy Statement](http://www.google.com/privacy.html).

Identifiable Information is collected via web forms that require your direct input, and stored on Serato Servers. Ownership and control of all data provided to Serato Websites is covered in our [Website Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/legal/website-terms-and-conditions).

Serato Websites use their own cookie to "remember" you from one visit to another. This allows you to browse Serato Websites with the personalised functionality enabled via your Identifiable Information but without having to re-enter it each visit. The cookie itself contains no Identifiable Information - it simply provides a link between your web browser and your Identifiable Information stored on Serato Servers.

  * To enable us to provide you with website personalisation options and/or various online services.

## Disclosure of your personal information

Serato take your privacy very seriously and will undertake all reasonable measures to ensure that your Private Personal Information is stored securely and provided only to approved third parties who, in Serato’s view, share a similar high regard for personal privacy.  Private Personal Information will only be provided to third parties for the purposes of after sales support and ongoing product development. However, we offer no guarantees that your Private Personal Information is safe from unauthorised access.

Serato will ensure that third parties can only access Private Personal Information that is relevant to their ongoing business relationship with Serato.

Serato will not provide your Private Personal Information to third parties unless the provision of that information is, in Serato’s opinion, of direct and obvious benefit to you. Any Private Personal Information that is provided to third parties will be provided for a purpose that is related to one of the purposes set out under the heading "What is your Identifiable Information Used For" above.

Serato may release Private Personal Information and other Identifiable Information when Serato considers it appropriate to do so for legal compliance and law enforcement, or to facilitate court proceedings.

## Accessing your personal information

All Personal Information stored on Serato Servers may be viewed and edited by you at any time. Should you be unable to edit your Personal Information you should notify us and we will take reasonable steps to ensure that it is accurate, complete and up to date.

Serato can, at their discretion, continue to store your Personal Information beyond such a time that you no longer wish to use Serato Websites, products or services. Retained Personal Information remains subject to all privacy policies as outlined in this document. Personal Information is retained for the purposes outlined in "What is Your Identifiable Information used for?".

Serato websites provide the means for users to send messages to one another such that they are visible only to a selected group of users. Serato will endeavor to honor the private nature of these messages but reserve the right to read them if they have reason to suspect that they are being used for purposes which violate the [Website Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/legal/website-terms-and-conditions), [Whitelabel.net End User Agreement](https://web.archive.org/legal/whitelabel-end-user-agreement), [Playlists Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/legal/playlists-terms-and-conditions) or [Forum Rules](https://web.archive.org/legal/website-forum-rules).
